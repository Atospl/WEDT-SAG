1495\Science\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There’s not a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. There’s an iridescent dinosaur. Scientists on Monday announced the discovery of a crow-sized, bird-like dinosaur with colorful feathers from northeastern China that lived 161 million years ago during the Jurassic Period. They named it Caihong, the Mandarin word for rainbow. Microscopic structures in the exquisitely preserved, nearly complete fossil unearthed in Hebei Province indicated that it boasted iridescent feathers, particularly on its head, neck and chest, with colors that shimmered and shifted in the light, like those of hummingbirds. The discovery “suggests a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,” said evolutionary biologist Chad Eliason of the Field Museum in Chicago, one of the researchers in the study published in the journal Nature Communications. Using powerful microscopes, the scientists detected within the feathers the remnants of organelles called melanosomes responsible for pigmentation. Their shape determines the color. Caihong’s feathers had pancake-shaped melanosomes similar to those of hummingbirds with iridescent feathers. Much of its body had dark feathers, but ribbon-like iridescent feathers covered its head and neck. While it possessed many bird-like characteristics, the researchers doubted it could actually get airborne. Its plumage could have attracted mates while also providing insulation. Caihong was a two-legged predator with a Velociraptor-like skull and sharp teeth, probably hunting small mammals and lizards. It had crests above its eyes that looked like bony eyebrows. Many dinosaurs possessed feathers. Birds evolved from small feathered dinosaurs near the end of the Jurassic Period. Caihong had fuzzy feathers and pennaceous ones, those that look like writing quills. It is the earliest-known creature with asymmetrical feathers, a trait used by birds to steer when flying. Caihong’s were on its tail, suggesting tail feathers, not arm feathers, were first utilized for aerodynamic locomotion. “It is extremely similar to some early birds such as Archaeopteryx,” said paleontologist Xing Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, referring to the earliest-known bird, which lived 150 million years ago. “Its forelimbs were configured like wings. To be honest, I am not sure what function the feathers have, and I don’t think that you can completely exclude the possibility that the feathers helped the animal to get in the air.” Asked what someone might say upon seeing Caihong, University of Texas paleontologist Julia Clarke said, “‘Wow!’ And if they are anything like me, they might want one as a pet. Not suitable for children.” The dinosaur’s full scientific name, Caihong juji, means “rainbow with a big crest.”\0.9366900324821472,-0.10129465907812119,-0.7608225345611572,-0.14108765125274658,-0.8343813419342041,0.7967976927757263,0.7341338396072388,-0.1292089968919754,-1.137197494506836,-0.45611733198165894,-0.3646808862686157,1.3871699571609497,-1.0699259042739868,-0.3605291247367859,-0.3989552855491638,1.2213846445083618,-0.7393035888671875,0.6720733642578125,0.3180004954338074,0.7636756896972656,0.8633111119270325,-1.0462086200714111,0.36525779962539673,-0.16897174715995789,-0.7528105974197388,-0.042713794857263565,1.0046559572219849,0.3045124411582947,0.8423835039138794,0.7201704382896423,0.33959072828292847,-0.13340039551258087,-0.10258764773607254,0.30221596360206604,-0.5109831690788269,0.09172079712152481,-0.3125329911708832,-0.5349795818328857,-0.1566799283027649,0.45785456895828247,-0.7561315298080444,-0.509666383266449,1.600562334060669,0.5816137194633484,-0.16902174055576324,0.024480368942022324,0.9015151858329773,-0.15052258968353271,-1.1728626489639282,-0.8913848996162415,0.31793326139450073,-0.44873231649398804,-0.7603510022163391,-0.23970311880111694,0.18975642323493958,-0.6054660081863403,0.7225366830825806,0.04302642121911049,0.0920138955116272,0.6284418702125549,-0.04891683906316757,-0.6908934116363525,-0.3883427679538727,0.2323930561542511,-0.4274234175682068,-0.10730166733264923,0.9770193696022034,1.2449835538864136,-1.1408668756484985,0.6221480965614319,0.22134409844875336,-0.3940477669239044,-0.8878573179244995,0.9074507355690002,-0.15264345705509186,-0.22757215797901154,-0.21448558568954468,0.3008039891719818,-0.7133974432945251,-0.7475692629814148,0.6688909530639648,-0.035422079265117645,0.3431186079978943,0.35093608498573303,-0.09536164999008179,-0.23187412321567535,0.196473628282547,0.42136168479919434,0.05713929980993271,0.0018126408103853464,-0.08655323833227158,0.22435922920703888,-0.283935010433197,0.3321436047554016,-0.5227086544036865,0.08916620165109634,-0.991946816444397,-1.0192649364471436,-0.09770120680332184,-0.12240120023488998\REUTERS\Chinese 'rainbow dinosaur' had iridescent feathers like hummingbirds\2018-01-16 20:30:06.0\
1496\Science\MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A fossilized dinosaur tail discovered in Morocco will be auctioned on Tuesday night in Mexico to raise funds for the reconstruction of thousands of schools damaged by two earthquakes that struck the Latin American nation in September. The 4-metre-(13-foot)-long, 180-kg (396-pound) tail will be offered at a reserve price of 1.8 million Mexican pesos ($95,805), according to organizer Morton’s Auction House. Anything raised above the reserve price will be donated to the BBVA Bancomer Foundation to help finance the reconstruction of some 5,000 damaged schools. The extremity belonged to a 17-metre (56-foot), 22-tonne sauropod of the Atlasaurus imelakei species that roamed the Atlas Mountains of Morocco during the Middle Jurassic, some 165 million years ago. The group of dinosaurs called sauropods were massive four-legged plant-eaters with long necks and long tails, and included the largest land animals ever on Earth. The two September quakes in Mexico killed an estimated 480 people and caused billions of dollars worth in damage. “Education is an element of enormous importance for the country, an element of social mobility, that is why we support the reconstruction of schools,” Adolfo Albo, from BBVA Bancomer Foundation, told Reuters. Albo said the foundation hoped the tail would sell for a lot more than the reserve price. Moroccan paleontologists took 300 hours to clean the gigantic remains of the reptile, before scientists in Utah pieced them back together. A Mexican businessman, who asked not to be named because he did not want publicity, purchased the fossil for his collection.

1497\Science\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists using images from an orbiting NASA spacecraft have detected eight sites where huge ice deposits near the Martian surface are exposed on steep slopes, a potential source of water that could help sustain future human outposts. While scientists already knew that about a third of the surface of Mars contains shallow ground ice and that its poles harbor major ice deposits, the research published on Thursday described thick underground ice sheets exposed along slopes up to 100 yards (meters) tall at the planet’s middle latitudes. “It was surprising to find ice exposed at the surface at these places. In the mid-latitudes, it’s normally covered by a blanket of dust or regolith,” loose bits of rock atop a layer of bedrock, said research geologist Colin Dundas of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Astrogeology Science Center in Flagstaff, Arizona, who led the study. The latitudes were the equivalent on Earth of Scotland or the tip of South America. The researchers used images from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has studied the Martian atmosphere and terrain since 2006, including the history of apparent water flows on or near the surface. The findings showed that ice may be more available than previously known for use as water to support future robotic or human exploration missions, perhaps even the establishment of a permanent Mars base. The water could be used for drinking and potentially conversion into oxygen to breathe. “Humans need water wherever they go, and it’s very heavy to carry with you. Previous ideas for extracting human-usable water from Mars were to pull it from the very dry atmosphere or to break down water-containing rocks,” said planetary scientist Shane Byrne of the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, a co-author of the study in the journal Science. “Here we have what we think is almost pure water ice buried just below the surface. You don’t see a high-tech solution,” Byrne added. “You can go out with a bucket and shovel and just collect as much water as you need. I think it’s sort of a game-changer. It’s also much closer to places humans would probably land as opposed to the polar caps, which are very inhospitable.” The deposits were found at seven geological formations called scarps, with slopes up to 55 degrees, in the southern hemisphere and one in the northern hemisphere. “Our interpretation is that this is consolidated snow deposited in geologically recent times,” Dundas said.\1.0098806619644165,-0.031296566128730774,-0.9705506563186646,-0.10985223948955536,-0.05459827557206154,0.38417670130729675,1.3203474283218384,0.44738534092903137,-0.1304057538509369,-0.18905524909496307,-1.095037579536438,0.8861268758773804,-0.43352943658828735,-0.5888175964355469,-0.26621466875076294,0.3536408245563507,-0.15075437724590302,0.1939159482717514,-0.8393839001655579,0.6622149348258972,0.5454931259155273,-0.776469886302948,1.4343225955963135,-0.6054287552833557,-0.6556682586669922,-0.1718573123216629,0.5458360314369202,0.002684850711375475,-0.07886648178100586,0.7242593169212341,-0.2995029091835022,-0.1551882028579712,0.18782614171504974,0.38089314103126526,-0.09610095620155334,-0.36881011724472046,-0.10501570999622345,-0.5968933701515198,0.5450741052627563,0.5885753631591797,-0.6700713038444519,0.03801441565155983,0.1417044997215271,-0.3241264820098877,-0.8559264540672302,1.2042872905731201,1.0967012643814087,-0.5292356014251709,-0.3476703464984894,-0.8461155891418457,1.6182947158813477,0.02579503506422043,-0.4110721945762634,-0.23477846384048462,-0.1743273288011551,-0.8351625800132751,0.4820680320262909,0.10043554753065109,-0.571972131729126,1.155166506767273,1.0529725551605225,-0.1096528097987175,-0.2605350911617279,-0.31486043334007263,-0.13594019412994385,0.2640821933746338,0.7211480140686035,1.3220738172531128,-0.7107343673706055,0.2526743710041046,0.6405361294746399,0.8160441517829895,-1.227369785308838,-0.5165334343910217,-0.2884167730808258,0.44608932733535767,-0.20876294374465942,0.2950271666049957,-0.7949409484863281,-0.6052297353744507,0.44988009333610535,-0.04650903865695,-1.1588143110275269,0.36731547117233276,-0.22965388000011444,-0.5082247257232666,0.014103465713560581,0.26104679703712463,0.5525332093238831,0.2140774428844452,-1.2785615921020508,0.6421111226081848,0.4445277154445648,0.282327264547348,-0.20651814341545105,0.04313233494758606,0.09608441591262817,-0.9144737720489502,-0.5217908620834351,0.8758771419525146\REUTERS\Martian ice deposits could sustain human outposts in the future\2018-01-12 00:22:38.0\
1498\Science\NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India launched its 100th satellite on Friday as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to project the country as a global low-cost provider of services in space. A total of 31 small satellites were launched into space on Friday. More than half of the micro and nano satellites were for the Unites States, and the remainder India, Canada, Finland, France, South Korea and the United Kingdom. “The launch of the 100th satellite by @isro signifies both its glorious achievements and also the bright future of India’s space program,” Modi said on Twitter. India’s space program has a budget of around $4 billion and Modi’s government hopes the latest launches will improve its prospects of winning a larger share of the more than $300 billion global space industry. Modi’s government has been promoting a domestic space program as a demonstration of low-cost technology and last February launched 104 satellites in a single mission, most of them for foreign customers. Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) used its workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C40), part of an advanced remote sensing satellite Cartosat-2 series or “eye in the sky”, for the Friday launch from Sriharikota in southern Andhra Pradesh state at 9.28 a.m. (3:58 GMT). The rocket weighs about 1,323 kgs, said a senior official at state-run ISRO, who did not wish to be named. India will use its latest satellites for better border surveillance and obtaining high resolution images of the earth. “PSLV-C40 is a highly sophisticated surveillance tool to keep an eye on Indian borders and will help the government track progress of infrastructure projects,” said Pallava Bagla, a science writer and co-author of “Reaching for the Stars: India’s Journey to Mars.” Two scientists at ISRO said images collected by the satellites will be used by the Indian security agencies to track military activities in neighboring Pakistan, China, Bangladesh Sri Lanka and Nepal.\0.13228556513786316,0.28089359402656555,-0.03146124258637428,0.33762702345848083,0.5544500350952148,-0.45815038681030273,1.2708979845046997,-0.3387177884578705,-0.04334229230880737,-0.21960851550102234,-0.3122235834598541,0.2542322874069214,0.2112985998392105,-0.4135969281196594,0.15171968936920166,-0.5182642936706543,-0.726936399936676,-0.08526019006967545,-0.14714667201042175,-0.17541377246379852,0.08624245226383209,-0.5049031972885132,0.49773305654525757,-0.37018924951553345,0.09678884595632553,0.30527251958847046,-0.3810328543186188,0.9210839867591858,0.5325961709022522,-0.5486446022987366,-1.2869327068328857,-1.1994110536761582E-4,-0.33733928203582764,-0.984825074672699,0.4475390911102295,-0.09509427100419998,0.6907351613044739,0.40812209248542786,-0.3649117350578308,-0.05113402009010315,-0.3048516511917114,-0.09500930458307266,-0.32579708099365234,-0.2882543206214905,-0.7575402855873108,0.2720848023891449,0.6828644275665283,1.2356278896331787,-0.005994238890707493,-0.07675127685070038,-0.0636172965168953,0.30393317341804504,0.6862756609916687,-0.4304775297641754,-0.1613437980413437,-0.313005656003952,0.7414868474006653,0.28939759731292725,-0.3313702344894409,-0.22722849249839783,0.4806698262691498,0.6009721755981445,0.8569261431694031,0.21484391391277313,-0.9252029657363892,0.15682536363601685,0.36856794357299805,-9.425446623936296E-4,0.41154444217681885,-0.018082022666931152,0.2612808346748352,-0.11063306033611298,-0.4398795962333679,-0.834171712398529,-0.29864993691444397,-1.0219204425811768,-0.7505915760993958,0.359397292137146,-0.07530895620584488,-0.4443652033805847,0.4266516864299774,-0.026570282876491547,0.543493390083313,-0.004759728442877531,0.1446266919374466,-0.08724051713943481,0.17655755579471588,0.4297528564929962,0.3060683608055115,0.23285117745399475,-0.3633164167404175,0.3184722363948822,0.4986848831176758,0.23246796429157257,-0.0026303790509700775,-0.26033955812454224,1.1731524467468262,-0.09904270619153976,-0.7230471968650818,1.1063833236694336\REUTERS\India sends its 100th satellite into space to watch borders\2018-01-12 07:15:13.0\
1499\Science\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In sandstone next to the high tide mark at the edge of Bass Strait in southeastern Australia, scientists have unearthed fossils of a two-legged, turkey-sized, plant-eating dinosaur apparently swept away in a large, powerful ancient river. Paleontologists on Thursday said the partial skeleton of the previously unknown beastie, named Diluvicursor pickeringi, that lived about 113 million years ago provides insight into the array of dinosaurs that inhabited Australia during the Cretaceous Period when it was still connected to Antarctica. “Skeletons of dinosaurs from Australia are very rare,” said University of Queensland paleontologist Matthew Herne, noting that Diluvicursor brings to only 19 the number of Australian dinosaurs that have been named to date. Diluvicursor’s remains were found amongst a jumbled collection of large fossilized tree trunks also apparently swept down the river during a flood. The site is on the south coast of the state of Victoria, about 105 miles (170 km) from Melbourne. Diluvicursor was about 7-1/2-feet (2.3 meters) long. Herne said it was “comparable to a large domesticated turkey in weight, but of course much longer than a turkey because of its tail.” The fossils included an almost complete tail, the lower part of the right leg and most of the right foot. It lived alongside meat-eating dinosaurs about 20 feet (6 meters) long, as well as armored dinosaurs, turtles, shrew-sized mammals and flying reptiles called pterosaurs. Herne said Diluvicursor, a member of a dinosaur group called ornithopods, was similar to another small, two-legged herbivorous dinosaur called Leaellynasaura that lived at about the same time and whose remains were unearthed about 9 miles (15 km) away. The two may have occupied different ecological niches and eaten different plants. Leaellynasaura was more lightly built, had a longer tail and may have been a more agile runner. “An analogy can be seen in the kind of diversity seen in the kangaroos and wallabies in present-day Australia who occupy very different niches, from open plains to dense forest habitats,” Herne said. Diluvicursor roamed a forested broad rift valley floodplain between Australia and Antarctica, which remained connected until about 45 million years ago. “The jury’s out on the climate,” Herne said. “Some believe that the climate was cold with winter ice, while others suggest the climate was warmer or more temperate.” Its genus name, Diluvicursor, means “flood runner.” Its species name, pickeringi, honors the late paleontologist David Pickering. The research was published in the scientific journal PeerJ.\0.623049259185791,-0.38858917355537415,0.4662269055843353,-0.7489756345748901,-0.5769482254981995,0.4118689000606537,0.21376857161521912,0.1597854346036911,0.5515793561935425,-0.7018308043479919,-0.7768060564994812,0.6586807370185852,0.49911466240882874,-0.4009721279144287,0.1667083501815796,0.8357175588607788,0.20787781476974487,0.07103485614061356,0.39075395464897156,0.2663111090660095,0.2480761855840683,-0.9141120314598083,-0.7744646072387695,-0.25908011198043823,-0.6436524987220764,-0.026067253202199936,1.4066120386123657,1.2185381650924683,-0.4870390295982361,0.1566178947687149,-0.6262903809547424,0.678974986076355,-0.7856647372245789,-0.3136579692363739,-0.048775773495435715,-0.4143381118774414,-0.0227883979678154,-0.0905890166759491,-0.2210986167192459,0.5107513070106506,0.22166265547275543,-0.8732097744941711,0.8589884638786316,-0.9808224439620972,-0.19840028882026672,0.10484503209590912,0.7274568676948547,-0.4321460425853729,-1.463396668434143,-0.5452468395233154,0.6556474566459656,0.3349788784980774,-0.3683290183544159,0.47182154655456543,0.21621838212013245,-0.5445739030838013,0.2629018723964691,0.5908725261688232,-0.7001836895942688,1.3652150630950928,0.10442522168159485,-0.45188331604003906,-0.6745094656944275,-0.4191910922527313,-0.23899193108081818,-0.21993069350719452,0.5725263953208923,0.5019471049308777,-0.07143312692642212,0.029779192060232162,0.18288728594779968,0.2917224168777466,-0.3322439193725586,-0.4147214889526367,0.04774508625268936,-0.03287849202752113,-0.39230674505233765,-0.06110295653343201,-0.8632891178131104,-1.0759073495864868,0.15077711641788483,-0.8326764702796936,-0.9229993224143982,0.352175772190094,-0.06110022962093353,-1.1712450981140137,0.4014681577682495,0.02595500461757183,0.41498899459838867,0.18909895420074463,-0.6311612129211426,1.5727155208587646,0.3679482936859131,-0.5175250768661499,0.38280969858169556,-0.12474947422742844,-0.06236673891544342,-0.57257479429245,-1.4166572093963623,1.2856991291046143\REUTERS\Fossil of dinosaur swept away in ancient Australian river found\2018-01-11 21:23:12.0\
1500\Science\(Reuters) - SpaceX on Tuesday defended the performance of one of its rockets used to launch a U.S. spy satellite that is believed to have been lost after failing to reach orbit, adding that no changes were anticipated to its upcoming launch schedule. “For clarity: after review of all data to date, Falcon 9 did everything correctly on Sunday night. If we or others find otherwise based on further review, we will report it immediately,” SpaceX, which is led by entrepreneur Elon Musk, said in an emailed statement. The classified intelligence satellite, code-named Zuma and built by Northrop Grumman Corp, failed to separate from the second stage of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and is assumed to have broken up or plunged into the sea, two officials said on Monday on condition of anonymity. “Since the data reviewed so far indicates that no design, operational or other changes are needed, we do not anticipate any impact on the upcoming launch schedule,” SpaceX added. The multibillion-dollar satellite was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX rocket on Sunday.\-0.34631383419036865,-0.7607989311218262,-0.09762165695428848,0.272681325674057,0.34988847374916077,-0.002429734682664275,0.387472003698349,-0.06450337171554565,-0.9164291620254517,-0.09041277319192886,-0.12338707596063614,0.20024465024471283,0.1675328016281128,-0.5306252837181091,-0.3152097761631012,0.21549180150032043,0.5072348713874817,0.3372094929218292,0.10496789962053299,-0.3883868157863617,0.1694238930940628,0.5038406252861023,-0.33614057302474976,-0.03149513527750969,-0.7201752066612244,0.32233554124832153,-0.04999219626188278,0.34241780638694763,-0.08692733943462372,-0.5430676341056824,-0.29985684156417847,0.48994484543800354,-0.06683610379695892,0.19681017100811005,0.9862121343612671,0.05269140750169754,-0.20103371143341064,-0.2642711400985718,0.027517415583133698,-0.25996240973472595,0.19377745687961578,-0.07027265429496765,0.3430021405220032,-0.09375392645597458,0.1110025942325592,-0.3125624358654022,0.05436661094427109,-0.10489890724420547,-0.5056557655334473,0.09475842863321304,-0.3745540678501129,0.014000162482261658,0.10796568542718887,-0.046878471970558167,0.33093634247779846,0.13556164503097534,-0.056181490421295166,0.41903164982795715,-0.6180869340896606,0.32585686445236206,0.29635366797447205,0.5658031702041626,-0.06899150460958481,0.3749057352542877,0.40792039036750793,-0.11631834506988525,-0.03709213435649872,0.46179836988449097,-0.051837123930454254,0.6109743118286133,0.9613192081451416,0.21080076694488525,-0.32580095529556274,-0.06538413465023041,0.3441930115222931,-0.08447621017694473,-0.33305925130844116,0.19542713463306427,0.3901039659976959,-0.5442467927932739,0.8804836869239807,0.09512868523597717,0.17679934203624725,0.1050490140914917,0.17588016390800476,0.570087730884552,0.730802059173584,-0.12120837718248367,-0.4004521369934082,-0.3497345745563507,-0.13233637809753418,0.13721156120300293,0.11054006963968277,-0.35257211327552795,-0.09806021302938461,0.1428365260362625,0.05582786723971367,-0.5561738014221191,-0.4421912133693695,0.2726859748363495\REUTERS\SpaceX defends rocket performance after loss of U.S. spy satellite\2018-01-09 20:19:57.0\
1501\Science\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. spy satellite that was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX rocket on Sunday failed to reach orbit and is assumed to be a total loss, two U.S. officials briefed on the mission said on Monday. The classified intelligence satellite, built by Northrop Grumman Corp, failed to separate from the second stage of the Falcon 9 rocket and is assumed to have broken up or plunged into the sea, said the two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The satellite is assumed to be “a write-off,” one of the officials said. The presumed loss of the satellite was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Northrop Grumman built the multibillion-dollar satellite, code-named Zuma, and was responsible for choosing the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle, both officials said. An investigation is under way, but there is no initial indication of sabotage or other interference, they said. SpaceX spokesman James Gleeson said: “We do not comment on missions of this nature; but as of right now reviews of the data indicate Falcon 9 performed nominally.” Space Exploration Technologies Corp, led by entrepreneur Elon Musk, launched its first satellite for the U.S. military with its Falcon 9 rocket in May of last year.\-0.4409547746181488,0.24550272524356842,0.3218546509742737,0.20580516755580902,0.23531752824783325,-0.36850231885910034,0.21736374497413635,-0.31277018785476685,-0.5738558769226074,-0.11132235080003738,-0.08494657278060913,0.17986804246902466,-0.24803240597248077,0.20947091281414032,0.14514726400375366,0.20018437504768372,0.23756098747253418,0.20099341869354248,0.1779697835445404,0.057968512177467346,0.8073069453239441,-0.44932955503463745,0.2721646726131439,0.0580105185508728,-0.4375531077384949,0.07957644760608673,0.20663416385650635,0.7716274261474609,0.44512662291526794,-0.34851834177970886,-0.7057142853736877,0.124419204890728,-0.22151905298233032,-0.49735069274902344,0.9660781621932983,-0.036133959889411926,-0.15022717416286469,0.09708984196186066,0.009851448237895966,-0.48238295316696167,-0.17560185492038727,0.028740132227540016,0.3838997483253479,0.11376558244228363,0.5429027676582336,0.4099466800689697,0.24660922586917877,0.1609533578157425,-0.2566911280155182,-0.3640161156654358,-0.1932472586631775,-0.2544234097003937,-0.1476331353187561,-0.047727543860673904,0.6791295409202576,0.008782709017395973,-0.008525945246219635,0.2717660367488861,-0.5636585354804993,-0.1696789711713791,0.43580278754234314,0.1346738636493683,0.3560423254966736,0.3308253288269043,0.2784135043621063,0.24013204872608185,0.47273826599121094,0.13646003603935242,-0.07280722260475159,0.07470647245645523,0.6936218738555908,0.37720218300819397,-0.22748972475528717,0.17045731842517853,0.14593848586082458,0.06964003294706345,0.08229526877403259,0.07946168631315231,0.40089353919029236,0.15693874657154083,0.5752402544021606,-0.02335590310394764,-0.5285219550132751,-0.034483060240745544,0.21320107579231262,0.3550834357738495,0.34354129433631897,0.03082931414246559,-0.09363102167844772,-0.27325892448425293,-0.6365178227424622,-0.2509761154651642,-0.4356435537338257,0.4103181064128876,0.37902262806892395,-0.4154755771160126,0.0810735672712326,-0.4297374188899994,-1.139805555343628,0.3440456688404083\REUTERS\U.S. spy satellite believed destroyed after failing to reach orbit: officials\2018-01-09 04:03:32.0\
1502\Science\TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese astronaut Norishige Kanai, on a mission to the International Space Station, apologized on Wednesday for saying he had grown 9 cm (3.5 inches) while in space and expressing concern about whether he’d be safe on his return to Earth. Most astronauts “grow” during protracted space missions because their spines extend in the absence of gravity, but the gains are usually limited to a couple of centimeters (inches) maximum and disappear once they are back on the ground. The 41-year-old Kanai, who went to space last month for a nearly six-month mission, posted on Twitter on Monday that he had “a big announcement.” “My height’s been measured here in space and somehow, somehow, I’ve grown 9 cm! In only three weeks I’ve really shot up, something I haven’t seen since high school,” he tweeted. “This makes me a little worried that I might not be able to fit in the Soyuz seats for our return.” But a bit over a day later - and in the wake of a flurry of news stories - he apologized, saying that he’d measured himself after his captain raised questions about the apparent growth and he had stretched only 2 cm from his Earth-bound height. “This mis-measurement appears to have become a big deal, so I must apologize for this terrible fake news,” he tweeted, without explaining how the original miscalculation had occurred. “It appears I can fit on the Soyuz, so I‘m relieved.”\0.8008672595024109,-0.30730658769607544,0.10002271085977554,-0.3548564314842224,0.8638325929641724,0.4258502125740051,0.06512555480003357,0.032167889177799225,-0.4128669798374176,-0.46423712372779846,0.5334733128547668,1.4347598552703857,-0.6276425719261169,-0.2441646009683609,-0.9004446268081665,-0.032748352736234665,0.024128355085849762,0.6727018356323242,0.008226304315030575,0.24711208045482635,0.04023280739784241,-0.25120672583580017,-0.12293295562267303,-0.44226357340812683,0.1411249041557312,0.4841400682926178,0.3421224057674408,0.20857778191566467,0.3593643307685852,-0.0710698589682579,0.5334411859512329,-0.9670326709747314,0.28034043312072754,0.45619839429855347,-0.05662795156240463,0.31696125864982605,-0.16415442526340485,-0.467099130153656,0.27539679408073425,0.0650310292840004,0.11852455884218216,-0.42480868101119995,0.3866024613380432,-0.17733199894428253,0.32950225472450256,0.3424733579158783,0.3970014750957489,0.4746398329734802,-0.2792821526527405,-0.3044669032096863,0.466875284910202,-0.9807250499725342,-1.004144310951233,0.3188309669494629,0.22156701982021332,0.15002216398715973,0.5746837854385376,0.2822394073009491,-0.027287930250167847,0.6561703681945801,0.3795205354690552,-0.2731629014015198,0.10758601874113083,-0.7511996030807495,-0.5566353797912598,0.7138739228248596,0.9055616855621338,0.6937353014945984,-0.7156190276145935,0.24427196383476257,0.2538725733757019,0.13101288676261902,-0.7409865856170654,0.4838607907295227,-1.409905195236206,-0.022481445223093033,0.0063674659468233585,-0.1441737562417984,-0.4233543574810028,-0.18904922902584076,-0.09753669053316116,-0.25057074427604675,-0.6392842531204224,-0.12089996039867401,0.3831220269203186,-0.29104554653167725,0.48195523023605347,0.31842851638793945,-0.4019971191883087,0.055177100002765656,-0.19244031608104706,-0.06510775536298752,-0.8740239143371582,0.35492855310440063,-0.2240486890077591,0.6556705236434937,-0.19681641459465027,0.31876590847969055,-0.7576642632484436,0.5808717608451843\REUTERS\Japanese astronaut apologizes for 'fake news' of height increase\2018-01-10 15:36:59.0\
1503\Science\BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Tiangong-1 space station is not out of control and does not pose a safety threat, a top Chinese spaceflight engineer said on Monday, after reports that the station was falling toward earth. The Tiangong-1, or “Heavenly Palace 1”, China’s first space lab, was launched into orbit in 2011 to carry out docking and orbit experiments as part of China’s ambitious space program, which aims to place a permanent station in orbit by 2023. Tiangong-1 was originally planned to be decommissioned in 2013 but China has repeatedly extended the length of its mission. The delay of re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere, which China said would happen in late 2017, had led some experts to suggest the space laboratory may be out of control. Zhu Congpeng, a top engineer at the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, told the state-backed Science and Technology Daily newspaper that the space station was not crashing and did not pose a safety or environmental threat. “We have been continuously monitoring Tiangong-1 and expect to allow it to fall within the first half of this year,” Zhu told the newspaper. “It will burn up on entering the atmosphere and the remaining wreckage will fall into a designated area of the sea, without endangering the surface,” he said. Re-entry was delayed in September 2017 in order to ensure that the wreckage would fall into an area of the South Pacific ocean where debris from Russian and U.S. space stations had previously landed, the paper said. The California-based Aerospace Corporation, a non-profit group that works the U.S. government, said the Tiangong-1’s re-entry was unlikely to be controlled but was highly unlikely to hit people or damage property, according to a post on its website last updated on Jan 3. “Although not declared officially, it is suspected that control of Tiangong-1 was lost and will not be regained before re-entry,” it said. There may be hazardous material on board that could survive re-entry, it said. Advancing China’s space program is a priority for President Xi Jinping, who has called for China to become a global space power with both advanced civilian space flight and capabilities that strengthen national security. Beijing insists that its space program is for peaceful purposes, but the U.S. Defense Department has said China’s program could be aimed at blocking adversaries from using space-based assets during a crisis.\0.6105252504348755,0.21214237809181213,-0.41487452387809753,0.7358165979385376,-0.20118771493434906,-0.19763778150081635,1.337712287902832,0.49039745330810547,-0.6690970659255981,-0.43309730291366577,-0.0021181146148592234,0.6138058304786682,-0.16509123146533966,0.3739534914493561,-0.051173411309719086,0.23885788023471832,-1.0243933200836182,-0.12427721172571182,0.20793694257736206,0.018771706148982048,0.3823319375514984,-0.6705896258354187,-0.6830602288246155,-0.3606877028942108,-0.07391165941953659,-0.4931192696094513,-0.4974222183227539,0.17957164347171783,-0.6465632319450378,-0.1470901519060135,-0.9527760148048401,-0.4334235191345215,-0.12377569824457169,0.5322750210762024,-0.14994211494922638,0.8555265069007874,-0.06780730187892914,-0.33814725279808044,-0.1560017168521881,0.0677701011300087,-0.5314655900001526,-0.526159405708313,0.8038850426673889,0.286988228559494,0.13603387773036957,0.10739585012197495,1.656241774559021,0.9084416627883911,-1.0620495080947876,0.37051406502723694,0.5261174440383911,0.45114457607269287,0.7766895890235901,-0.4282084107398987,0.9225147366523743,-1.1040221452713013,-0.07279413193464279,-0.8280060291290283,-0.4960957169532776,-0.257038414478302,0.2526768147945404,-0.16745419800281525,0.7233424186706543,0.8983432054519653,-0.5413382053375244,-0.8175968527793884,0.8794452548027039,0.8450267910957336,-0.4073432385921478,0.5553519129753113,0.5322310328483582,0.3881159722805023,0.3533138036727905,0.1728508323431015,-0.08737680315971375,-0.3411608934402466,0.2629813253879547,-0.09948419034481049,-1.470550537109375,-0.7090818285942078,0.2787264585494995,0.3347106873989105,-0.8282706141471863,0.430582731962204,0.21981659531593323,0.2514357566833496,0.6683955192565918,0.0832894816994667,0.28755033016204834,-0.20971150696277618,-0.3959601819515228,0.35779961943626404,0.38833239674568176,0.4975012242794037,0.3821580111980438,-0.06800682097673416,0.6664619445800781,0.14403888583183289,-1.8610529899597168,1.1469193696975708\REUTERS\China's Tiangong-1 space lab is not out of control: top Chinese engineer\2018-01-08 05:34:24.0\
1504\Science\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It was too good to be true. Scientists have ruled out the most exotic explanation -- an orbiting alien mega-structure -- for the behavior of a celestial oddity dubbed Tabby’s Star that has been puzzling scientists with its sporadic dimming and brightening. Astronomers said on Wednesday that the most thorough study to date of the star, officially called KIC 8462852, showed that its dimming episodes are not caused by a large opaque object passing in front of it. The dimming could be due to some sort of dust, they added, though the cause remains uncertain. The researchers relied on observations of Tabby’s Star from March 2016 to December 2017 using Las Cumbres Observatory telescopes in Maui and the Canary Islands. The star is named after Louisiana State University astrophysicist Tabetha Boyajian, who was instrumental in identifying its idiosyncrasies in 2015. Beginning in May 2017, the scientists observed four episodes when the star’s light dipped. The data showed less dimming in the star’s red light than in its blue light, and a large opaque object would dim all colors of light equally when passing in front of a star, Boyajian said. “We took measures of the star’s brightness in several colors. Data taken in this way can inform us on what kind of material is passing in front of the star,” Boyajian added. Numerous hypotheses have been offered about the star’s occasional dimming, including a hypothetical mega-structure called a Dyson Sphere built to surround a star and harvest its energy output. “Sure, it’s disappointing that this isn’t the anomaly that will turn out to be that big discovery. But we always knew the chances were low. It’s like finding out that your lottery ticket isn’t a winner: disappointing, but not surprising,” said another of the researchers, Penn State astrophysicist Jason Wright. Tabby’s star, roughly 40 percent more massive than the sun, is located about 1,280 light-years away from our solar system in the constellation Cygnus. Its light has been observed dimming as much as 22 percent. The new observations were consistent with the effects of dust -- fine grains of material -- on the starlight, Wright said. There was no hint of gas along with the dust, Wright said. “We still aren’t 100 percent sure where the dust is, but it seems to be somewhere around the star,” Wright added. “We’re still not sure where it’s coming from -- maybe colliding asteroids or comets.” The findings were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\0.6030376553535461,-0.5752949714660645,0.2376011162996292,-0.8446224331855774,-0.6132155656814575,0.5499968528747559,0.9967201352119446,-0.4385060667991638,-0.1149054616689682,-0.21521924436092377,-0.5984783172607422,0.8459262847900391,0.44894012808799744,-0.22838672995567322,-0.5692520141601562,0.48459142446517944,-0.30082082748413086,0.2841727137565613,0.20980480313301086,0.02311643958091736,-0.2860707640647888,-0.774823009967804,-0.10465431958436966,-0.40203943848609924,-0.24781863391399384,0.3272826075553894,0.757276177406311,0.7859296202659607,-0.34374183416366577,0.23850439488887787,-0.0032685771584510803,0.8632550835609436,-0.7269020676612854,0.17673343420028687,0.4904513657093048,-0.963329017162323,-0.4973382353782654,-0.6156168580055237,-0.1791052222251892,0.4718746244907379,-0.10299775004386902,-1.1337087154388428,0.5439592003822327,-0.7512505054473877,0.3803189992904663,0.08019409328699112,0.6217754483222961,-0.39021068811416626,-1.6296734809875488,-0.020157985389232635,1.1638239622116089,-0.22463679313659668,-0.18558087944984436,-0.1806199997663498,0.6785681843757629,-0.21687549352645874,-0.10416612029075623,0.3924453556537628,0.07323234528303146,0.7350119948387146,0.31206372380256653,-1.0210157632827759,-0.6512279510498047,0.3206421136856079,0.5414535999298096,-0.09163931757211685,0.3748125731945038,0.8959423899650574,-1.025452971458435,0.9980360865592957,0.8049542903900146,0.01635698787868023,-0.5861283540725708,-0.10167175531387329,-0.26044949889183044,-0.6211858987808228,-0.12811510264873505,0.4068796932697296,-0.5127961039543152,-0.5685288906097412,0.25068551301956177,-0.5663467645645142,-0.7126521468162537,-0.03597749024629593,-0.34179002046585083,-0.2934609055519104,0.2672427296638489,0.16759467124938965,0.4575333595275879,-0.5227524638175964,0.4290112257003784,-0.5271350741386414,0.44892314076423645,0.07157708704471588,-0.13793903589248657,0.4437994062900543,-0.9271073341369629,-0.9703086018562317,-0.605920135974884,1.0535600185394287\REUTERS\Sorry, sci-fi fans: star's oddness not due to alien mega-structure\2018-01-03 22:10:40.0\
1505\Technology\BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple’s (AAPL.O) announcement that it will pay $38 billion in U.S. tax on its overseas cash will not reduce the $16 billion tax bill the company owes Ireland following a European Union ruling, the EU’s executive said on Thursday. “Nothing has changed,” a spokesman for the European Commission said, with regards to its 2016 ruling that Apple received illegal state aid in Ireland through sweetheart tax deals with the government. At the time of the ruling, the Commission said the amount Apple would have to pay to Ireland could be reduced if other countries found the company should have recorded its sales there instead of Ireland, or if its European subsidiaries were to pay more tax to the U.S. parent company. However, Apple’s announcement on Wednesday that it would pay about $38 billion in one-time U.S. tax payments on its overseas cash do not fit either of these criteria. “The Commission’s 2016 state aid decision found that, over many years, tax rulings issued by Ireland had allowed Apple to pay less tax on profits recorded in Ireland than other companies subject to same national taxation laws. This gave Apple an illegal advantage in breach of EU state aid rules, which must now be recovered by Ireland - nothing has changed in that regard,” said the Commission spokesman. The Commission ordered Apple to pay back Ireland up to 13 billion euros ($16 billion) in August 2016 and has since taken Dublin to court over its delays in recovering the money. Apple on Wednesday unveiled a $30 billion U.S. investment plan and said it would pay about $38 billion in foreign cash taxes. It is unclear whether Apple will be able to offset the Irish tax bill against the 15.5 percent U.S. tax on offshore tax piles.

1506\Technology\(Reuters) - U.S. tech startup Reedeux Media said it plans to list on the Nasdaq exchange later this year, seeking a valuation of up to $1 billion after selling out the first tranche of its media cryptocurrency coin offering on Thursday. Reedeux, which has an app that allows consumers to instantly buy products advertised on TV shows, said it sold $2.5 million worth of the tokens in a first pre-sale on Wednesday. The company expects to launch its digital platform in April and follow that with an initial public offering worth at least $100 million. Online streaming services, including Amazon.com Inc’s Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hulu, will air shows that the company plans to produce using the money raised from its coin offering, according to documents seen by Reuters. The company has also tied up with Comcast Corp’s NBC Universal and Walt Disney Co’s Disney ABC. The company has also partnered with Samsung’s U.S. business to integrate its CONNEXT app with the South Korean electronics giant’s phones, laptops and televisions while also showcasing these products on television shows. Los Angeles, California-based Reedeux is currently in the process of hiring underwriters for the initial public offering, with Credit Suisse being the front runner, a source close to the deal told Reuters. The source declined to be identified because the talks are ongoing and confidential. The company is expected to be cash-flow positive by late April to early May, Federico Pacquing, chief executive of Reedeux, told Reuters. Reedeux expects each hour-long episode of shows to have up to 4,000 different products featured and estimates it will have upfront payments from sponsors and partners of $30 million by the time of launch. The company’s app seeks to offer struggling retailers easier distribution and advertising channels for their products by syncing with the TV show they are watching. Reedeux hopes to issue $100 million of its “Medadyn” utility tokens, which will give buyers rights to access products or services rather than a stake in the company. Participants who buy the token will become financial partners to particular media projects and the buyers of the coins would receive a portion of the revenue generated by the product placement in the show and the sales of the product. The company’s initial coin offering comes at a time when regulators in various countries have been intensifying scrutiny of digital currency fund-raising. Bitcoin, which skyrocketed nearly 2,000 percent last year and hovered near a peak of $20,000, slumped to around $11,600 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Thursday.\-0.2772257924079895,0.4779016375541687,-0.05018249899148941,-0.984382152557373,0.11326225847005844,-0.8342546224594116,0.1390381008386612,-0.41224154829978943,-1.1890347003936768,0.3169797658920288,-0.3047647476196289,-0.2332748919725418,0.34133923053741455,-0.5468602180480957,-0.6381356716156006,0.08427976816892624,-0.5431841611862183,0.045574385672807693,-0.17952024936676025,-0.5725401043891907,0.4363662898540497,-0.6579474210739136,0.6385063529014587,-0.5590776205062866,-0.1265316605567932,-0.030634470283985138,0.03363911807537079,-0.043017130345106125,1.1585872173309326,0.1304152011871338,0.5117642283439636,0.2628626525402069,0.7380255460739136,-0.3630848526954651,0.30560386180877686,-0.5116241574287415,0.012057804502546787,-0.27947473526000977,0.30475756525993347,0.2614601254463196,-0.0142451087012887,1.0746934413909912,0.07626829296350479,0.12195144593715668,-0.23651188611984253,-1.3800792694091797,0.09684611111879349,-0.16813762485980988,-0.918686032295227,0.2964695394039154,-0.10482106357812881,0.4066089689731598,-1.112891674041748,-0.5551183819770813,0.8437920808792114,-0.25844913721084595,-0.6429066061973572,-0.3878454566001892,-0.6123770475387573,0.7167627215385437,0.34026259183883667,0.2822381854057312,-0.0027442770078778267,0.22372941672801971,-0.1801457554101944,-0.03163557127118111,0.10180992633104324,1.014288306236267,-0.11794251203536987,0.14188650250434875,0.3628115952014923,-0.47899216413497925,-0.161850705742836,-0.3073083758354187,-0.09939256310462952,0.40360915660858154,-0.848978579044342,-0.6856934428215027,-0.6144169569015503,-0.48033156991004944,0.378878116607666,0.3544054329395294,-0.3261951506137848,1.227925419807434,0.2879784405231476,0.3557118773460388,0.5949582457542419,-1.0245139598846436,0.246195450425148,-0.5585252642631531,0.6344271898269653,0.3464910686016083,0.2465893179178238,-0.9020342826843262,-0.5037710666656494,-0.19066442549228668,0.004516384564340115,-0.35092708468437195,-0.5520852208137512,0.8233999609947205\REUTERS\Reedeux Media seeks IPO after first coin offering sells out\2018-01-18 16:28:08.0\
1507\Technology\NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has led a $38 million investment round by large banks in Visible Alpha, a young New York-based company that helps investment managers better value the equity research services they receive from brokers. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Banco Santander SA (SAN.MC), Exane BNP Paribas, Macquarie Group Ltd (MQG.AX) and Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) participated in the strategic investment round, the company said on Thursday. Visible Alpha’s existing investors including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) also joined. The startup said it will use the injection of cash to expand globally and ensure that its offering keeps up with client demand. Launched in early 2017, Visible Alpha uses technology to help fund managers keep track of the amount and value of equity research and corporate access that they receive from their brokers. It also offers tool that aggregate data from analysts to make it easier to use and more valuable for investors. It is among a growing group of financial technology companies that are hoping to take advantage of regulatory changes in Europe and pressure on asset management fees that are driving changes in the equity research business model. New rules in the European Union’s revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid II), an overhaul of the region’s trading rulebook that came into force this month, require asset managers to pay for research out of their own pocket. This has increased demand for tools that can help them gauge the quality of research. Large brokers have traditionally “bundled” research fees together with what they charge to execute trades. Over the past few years asset managers have also been under pressure to cut fees due to lackluster returns, driving them to be more aware about how they spend their research dollars. These trends have “increased the amount of pressure to have analysts demonstrate” the value they are providing, said in an interview Scott Rosen, the CEO of Visible Alpha. The company says it works with around 450 research providers and has more than 100 buy-side firms as clients which manage a combined $16 trillion in assets. It mainly operates in the United States and plans to expand further into Europe, Asia and Latin America, Rosen said.\-0.5252673625946045,-0.2241002768278122,-0.38384881615638733,0.28296205401420593,1.393040418624878,-0.012651186436414719,0.28586095571517944,-0.45995503664016724,-1.2176498174667358,-1.644679650780745E-5,-0.07318902015686035,0.5250118374824524,-0.18034334480762482,-0.9276156425476074,0.15508773922920227,0.3364798426628113,0.5149394273757935,-0.5338243842124939,-0.4909692704677582,-0.9156601428985596,-0.23550961911678314,-0.8326322436332703,-0.7898368835449219,-0.6505225300788879,0.31764161586761475,0.7600538730621338,-0.20616629719734192,-0.5746995210647583,0.6084371209144592,0.4603990614414215,0.0572248212993145,-0.23596473038196564,0.40094444155693054,-1.1727045774459839,-0.12396283447742462,-0.715581476688385,0.36468592286109924,-0.35591575503349304,0.1366046518087387,1.2523436546325684,-0.8385953307151794,0.0536549910902977,-0.2915048897266388,0.3238658607006073,-1.0488327741622925,-0.4696715772151947,-0.9686700701713562,0.09555922448635101,0.11317002773284912,0.1798151582479477,-0.1062994971871376,0.30844080448150635,-1.3415210247039795,-0.5194688439369202,0.5259352326393127,-0.07931454479694366,-0.5026170015335083,0.23472124338150024,0.021977784112095833,0.4052623510360718,-0.020849304273724556,-0.37587282061576843,0.13948650658130646,0.054297707974910736,-1.107635259628296,-0.2469722181558609,0.3751540184020996,0.2860151529312134,-0.478415310382843,-0.5006440281867981,-0.044088441878557205,0.3562260866165161,-1.0054723024368286,-0.7402461171150208,0.33539438247680664,-0.18073832988739014,-0.3759067952632904,-0.22566048800945282,-1.4076380729675293,-0.8083965182304382,0.022944245487451553,0.45942723751068115,0.16472072899341583,1.6467368602752686,-1.131735920906067,0.440236896276474,-0.3762083947658539,-0.1503392457962036,-0.856234073638916,0.12242117524147034,0.7679740786552429,0.7073418498039246,0.4064042568206787,0.8817479610443115,-1.1612074375152588,-0.40362900495529175,0.10432078689336777,-0.14718230068683624,-1.0334891080856323,-0.23670248687267303\REUTERS\Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and others invest $38 million in research tech startup\2018-01-18 13:17:29.0\
1508\Technology\TORONTO (Reuters) - Schneider Electric SE disclosed on Thursday that hackers exploited a flaw in its software in a watershed hack discovered last month that halted plant operations at an industrial facility. Schneider security officials told Reuters that they are working on a software update to fix the issue, but declined to say when it will be ready. News of the incident surfaced on Dec. 14, when cyber security firms disclosed that hackers likely working for a nation-state had invaded one of Schneider’s Triconex safety systems. The company and security firms have declined to identify the victim or country where it occurred.\-0.2027503103017807,-0.29686465859413147,-0.11724243313074112,-0.07793643325567245,0.5739071369171143,0.18097932636737823,0.36769405007362366,0.3563700020313263,-0.6200075745582581,-0.10315947979688644,0.22539931535720825,-0.015914510935544968,-0.14702528715133667,-0.35240066051483154,-0.7288172245025635,-0.324525386095047,-0.26284703612327576,-0.29402098059654236,0.292428195476532,0.19643822312355042,-0.12498371303081512,-0.37453997135162354,0.5625471472740173,-0.3523749113082886,0.05001727119088173,-0.1663491129875183,-0.08601505309343338,-0.10654976218938828,-0.06066281348466873,-0.19195833802223206,0.11236920207738876,0.33387041091918945,0.42308682203292847,-0.17026935517787933,-0.06610680371522903,0.27688467502593994,0.22458459436893463,-0.47405099868774414,0.050642210990190506,-0.06419533491134644,-0.20543447136878967,4.069808346685022E-4,-0.020930610597133636,-0.24829640984535217,-0.37456783652305603,-0.47875291109085083,0.40438294410705566,-0.07503310590982437,0.013069449923932552,0.2568443715572357,0.10069471597671509,-0.3039178252220154,-0.16286024451255798,-0.22894518077373505,0.614548921585083,-0.31068509817123413,-0.024216627702116966,0.07133665680885315,-0.8193972706794739,0.39856183528900146,0.15829765796661377,-0.13463827967643738,0.1133563295006752,0.021644871681928635,-0.4491266906261444,-0.09739933907985687,-0.25706201791763306,0.10857640951871872,0.037178270518779755,-0.08294461667537689,0.3715987503528595,0.33673131465911865,-0.090267114341259,-0.13620521128177643,-0.12745147943496704,-0.17520560324192047,-0.5387680530548096,-0.16623444855213165,-0.22919480502605438,0.02020733617246151,0.6991469264030457,0.18302558362483978,-0.12416119873523712,0.5235504508018494,-0.16808399558067322,-0.166942298412323,-0.030506035313010216,0.24761877954006195,-0.20257404446601868,0.2585955858230591,0.04268956184387207,0.03385743498802185,-0.15630459785461426,0.09927261620759964,0.08223769813776016,-0.2851909101009369,-0.03899375721812248,-0.2188880294561386,-0.2013135701417923,0.7321485877037048\REUTERS\Schneider Electric says software bug exploited in watershed hack\2018-01-18 16:14:13.0\
1509\Technology\(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) has short-listed 20 cities and regions, including one in Canada, for the construction of a second headquarters that it says will generate 50,000 new, high-paying jobs. Major U.S. centers including New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington D.C. were on the list announced on Thursday, along with Toronto and smaller cities such as Raleigh, North Carolina, and Columbus, Ohio. The others that met the company’s criteria were Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Indianapolis, Miami, Montgomery County in Maryland, Nashville, Newark, Northern Virginia, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. Cutting down the list from 238 locations that initially bid, the announcement was broadly in line with expectations and is the first stage in a fight over the thousands of jobs and billions in secondary investment and revenue the “HQ2” will bring. Following Apple’s announcement on Wednesday that it would build a new campus and create 20,000 new jobs as part of a $30 billion investment, it also underlines the growing power of U.S. technology companies over the economy. Amazon promised when it launched bidding in September that the new headquarters, an equal of its Seattle head office, would create up to 50,000 jobs averaging more than $100,000 in annual compensation over the next 10 to 15 years. Some bidders have already gone public with promises of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the tech giant if they were chosen. New Jersey proposed $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if the company chooses Newark and sticks to hiring commitments. The mayor of the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Jason Lary, said his city could use 345 acres of industrial land to create a new city called Amazon and make Chief Executive Jeff Bezos its mayor for life. Amazon said on Thursday it expected to make a decision this year and would work with each of the candidate locations to get more information and evaluate the feasibility of a future partnership.\-0.1411760300397873,-0.29905617237091064,-0.5903896689414978,0.3079662322998047,0.6080403923988342,-0.7391073703765869,0.7671651244163513,0.3295310437679291,-0.816413938999176,-0.5118545889854431,0.15809720754623413,0.0888219103217125,-0.01087726466357708,-0.40921613574028015,-0.4186469614505768,-0.8866117596626282,0.16039082407951355,-0.27922534942626953,-0.4263969659805298,0.1214127317070961,0.44718825817108154,-0.7516774535179138,-0.7775893211364746,-0.4702121317386627,-0.18143606185913086,0.0934697836637497,0.41706839203834534,0.15736530721187592,-0.051051393151283264,0.05057717114686966,-0.4776037931442261,0.35041946172714233,-0.07270567119121552,-0.10601023584604263,0.20200729370117188,-0.5356518626213074,-0.30026721954345703,-0.9599284529685974,0.44378596544265747,-0.12494499981403351,0.03895621374249458,0.09018801897764206,-0.22945712506771088,0.08368337154388428,-1.1038239002227783,-0.04638076201081276,0.3008943200111389,1.047263503074646,-0.6694213151931763,-0.5564656853675842,0.3308105766773224,0.47274577617645264,-0.3455357849597931,-0.9184924960136414,0.06258951872587204,-0.42666372656822205,-0.419670969247818,-0.6372075080871582,-0.653469979763031,0.719160258769989,-0.21637937426567078,-0.25746047496795654,0.40676411986351013,0.8535003066062927,-0.29049837589263916,-0.23297248780727386,0.20135721564292908,0.7497544288635254,-0.8591013550758362,0.41083022952079773,0.026218416169285774,-0.6351903676986694,-0.4283992350101471,0.2293836772441864,-0.5108178853988647,-0.023017290979623795,-0.1100107878446579,0.17500653862953186,-0.0649414137005806,-0.23345184326171875,0.8346633315086365,-0.4782271385192871,-0.6672334671020508,0.3838256299495697,-0.07424142211675644,-0.4652960002422333,0.16618725657463074,0.16795431077480316,-0.003396693617105484,-0.006624366156756878,0.10146696865558624,1.1256906986236572,-0.2798213064670563,-0.07826102524995804,-0.08439087122678757,-0.321309894323349,-0.21116721630096436,-0.20640191435813904,-0.8413616418838501,-0.22238057851791382\REUTERS\Amazon shortlists 20 cities for second headquarters\2018-01-18 16:18:25.0\
1510\Technology\(Reuters) - Xerox Corp investor Carl Icahn on Thursday said he agreed with fellow stakeholder Darwin Deason that a joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm Holdings should be revised or terminated, and reiterated a change in leadership. On Wednesday, Deason urged the photocopier pioneer to make public its joint venture agreement with Japan’s Fujifilm, saying U.S. securities laws require it. “It is hard to see how any Xerox shareholder could disagree”, the activist investor said of Deason’s view on the venture in an open letter that he earlier tweeted. Carl Icahn through Icahn Associates Corp holds about a 9.7 percent stake in Xerox - making him the largest shareholder, while Deason is the third-largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. Xerox, in a statement on Wednesday, said it reviewed the letter from Deason and believes that his assertions and characterizations are “false and misleading.” Icahn, who has in the past called for a leadership change at Xerox, said “drastic action is needed now” as fears of failing to replace Chief Executive Jeff Jacobson could lead to a loss of his investment. Xerox and Fujifilm have a five-decade-old copier joint venture focusing on the Asia-Pacific region including Japan and China. Shares of Xerox were down 0.6 pct at $31.73 in early trade.\-0.15860578417778015,0.016693023964762688,0.22545361518859863,0.6110892295837402,0.6483432650566101,-0.1473090946674347,0.3942919671535492,-0.309323251247406,-0.8512981534004211,-0.17513351142406464,-0.2274850755929947,0.15524889528751373,0.29641687870025635,0.03794187307357788,0.2181454747915268,0.04103228822350502,-0.36293408274650574,-0.13519133627414703,0.35966551303863525,-0.044171128422021866,0.2638549506664276,0.07379890978336334,-0.5949851870536804,-0.46393635869026184,-0.41011855006217957,0.05961766839027405,-0.023187221959233284,0.6887671947479248,-0.31962117552757263,-0.06477592140436172,0.607401430606842,0.3297725319862366,-0.28695496916770935,0.13491997122764587,0.3592308461666107,0.43850240111351013,0.21993400156497955,0.006771504878997803,-0.09050668030977249,-0.19672901928424835,-0.12706495821475983,-0.1897735893726349,0.46310967206954956,0.3644006848335266,-0.9720832705497742,-0.08205094933509827,-0.1096554845571518,0.5835952758789062,0.18053776025772095,-0.30759677290916443,0.47984638810157776,-0.3508123457431793,-0.569991946220398,0.08857297152280807,0.5361534953117371,-0.24832183122634888,0.0861174613237381,-0.619019627571106,-0.6014692187309265,0.2666347920894623,0.20784246921539307,-0.654360294342041,0.24743522703647614,-0.3631090819835663,-0.6574230790138245,0.17638996243476868,0.646188497543335,-0.0453316830098629,-0.3899816870689392,0.06840579956769943,-0.2727603614330292,-0.6225000023841858,-0.3160547912120819,0.5636662244796753,-0.19816502928733826,-0.028016213327646255,0.3499123454093933,0.6682531833648682,0.12328026443719864,0.0938611626625061,-0.063492551445961,0.003713988233357668,0.23267725110054016,0.06827040761709213,0.10588744282722473,0.15747402608394623,0.2278103530406952,0.47794219851493835,-0.162819966673851,-0.01583564095199108,0.22571836411952972,-0.48491719365119934,-0.48761364817619324,0.06319810450077057,-0.49141764640808105,-0.30994394421577454,-0.11993999034166336,-0.2813809812068939,-1.2954881191253662,-0.6108546853065491\REUTERS\Carl Icahn seeks revision or termination of Xerox-Fujifilm deal\2018-01-18 16:02:42.0\
1511\Technology\SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Google, Singapore investor Temasek and China’s Meituan-Dianping are investing in Go-Jek as part of a $1.2 billion fundraising round, bolstering the Indonesian ride-hailing firm in its battle with deep-pocketed rivals Grab and Uber, sources said. The investments by Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google - its first in a ride-hailing firm in Asia - and the other prominent investors underscore both the potential of the business in Southeast Asia, a region of 640 million people, and the insatiable appetite for funds at ride-hailing businesses. These businesses have been spending heavily to attract both riders and drivers, with discounts and promotions that have drained their cash. They have frequently courted deep-pocketed investors for funds. Grab and Uber are backed by Japan’s SoftBank Group (9984.T), while Go-Jek has secured investments from Chinese technology giants Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) and JD.com Inc (JD.O). “As a strategic investor, Google can add a lot to Go-Jek’s business,” said one source. “Go-Jek’s challenge is not how to grow the business but to have a big pool of funding to support all its services,” he said. Go-Jek’s existing investors such as global private equity firms KKR & Co LP (KKR.N) and Warburg Pincus LLC are also participating in the latest funding, the sources said. The funding round opened last year and is expected to close in a few weeks, they said. Google is investing about $100 million, two sources said. Samsung Venture Investment Corp also participated in the funding, one source said. It was not immediately clear how much the other investors are pumping in individually. Breakingviews said, citing sources, the new money from investors values Go-Jek group at roughly $4 billion, compared to more than $6 billion for Grab. Google, KKR, Meituan-Dianping, Temasek and Warburg declined to comment. Samsung Electronics also declined to comment. Go-Jek did not respond to requests for comment. The people declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media. The Go-Jek investment would mark a deepening of Google’s bet on Asia. In September, it agreed to acquire 2,000 engineers from Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC Corp (2498.TW) for $1.1 billion. It also launched a localized payments app for India as it tries to gain a foothold in the country’s rapidly-growing digital payments space. This year, it joined an investment in Chinese live-stream mobile game platform Chushou, which followed a minority stake in Beijing-based artificial intelligence startup Mobvoi in 2015. Southeast Asia has emerged as the fastest growing e-commerce market globally, according to a research report published by Google and Temasek in December 2017. It estimated 330 million monthly active internet users by year-end 2017, adding over 70 million new users since 2015. Both Grab and Uber are expanding in Go-Jek’s home market, which is Southeast Asia’s most populous country and where locals are keen to lap up an array of mobile-based services. Southeast Asia is the world’s third-biggest ride-hailing market after China and the United States. Go-Jek, a play on the local word for motorbike taxis, delivers everything from meals and groceries to cleaners, masseuses and hairdressers across Indonesia’s capital city Jakarta, all at the touch of a smartphone app. The company, which began as a ride-hailing app for motorcycle taxis, was set up by Nadiem Makarim, a graduate of the Harvard School of Business and a former associate with McKinsey, who has quickly become a poster child for start-up success in Indonesia. Go-Jek has become a crucial workaround in Jakarta, which has some of the worst traffic in the world. The service’s riders can move goods and people faster around the city than cars, helping businesses increase sales dramatically as they reach more consumers. While it operates mainly in Indonesia, it is eyeing expansion in the region. Its mobile payment business, Go-Pay, is also growing rapidly. “Certainly, Go-Jek wants to solve the problem of payment in Indonesia,” said Daniel Tumiwa, a member of the Indonesia E-commerce Association advisory board, referring to the latest funding. “For Go-Jek’s competitors, it means that they have to keep innovating and creating better products and solving the people’s problems even faster.” Reuters reported last year that JD.com was investing about $100 million in Go-Jek. This followed an investment by Tencent, which is also an investor in JD.com.\0.2911236584186554,0.5972375273704529,0.4014856815338135,0.19212953746318817,0.5012564659118652,-1.448410987854004,-0.01225313264876604,-1.0402085781097412,-0.7490989565849304,0.47178515791893005,0.05766706541180611,1.572706699371338,1.0080348253250122,0.7745527625083923,-0.8847832083702087,0.03166145831346512,-0.2314830720424652,-0.6717658638954163,0.5760958194732666,-0.49359220266342163,-0.5792835354804993,-1.2514793872833252,0.2696196436882019,-0.4160148501396179,0.632769763469696,0.8679942488670349,-1.2307788133621216,-0.29112398624420166,0.5486875772476196,-0.3934110701084137,-0.06479016691446304,0.07940638065338135,0.3950391411781311,0.41714775562286377,-0.2181858867406845,-0.8466688394546509,-0.5412769317626953,1.237465739250183,0.670601487159729,0.3799632489681244,-1.6037707328796387,-0.4325296878814697,-0.03849980607628822,-0.0012050584191456437,-0.16452404856681824,-0.8320024013519287,-0.8121357560157776,0.6879320740699768,-0.2672577202320099,-0.18517740070819855,1.2253118753433228,0.10005906224250793,-1.2695724964141846,-0.13231393694877625,0.27950963377952576,-0.03992165997624397,0.3911422789096832,-0.1318880170583725,-0.5274926424026489,0.3695368766784668,0.7461867928504944,0.07946015149354935,1.0174670219421387,0.18404781818389893,-1.1954606771469116,-0.36018797755241394,1.0709847211837769,0.8602116703987122,-0.282330185174942,-0.4209804832935333,0.49129998683929443,0.40907856822013855,0.4113980531692505,-0.10064876079559326,-0.08820341527462006,-0.26901522278785706,0.5148245096206665,-0.7804878950119019,-1.2789279222488403,-0.6973930597305298,-0.056321077048778534,0.4351033866405487,-0.8022046089172363,1.1977616548538208,0.18993690609931946,-0.8066936731338501,0.19622017443180084,0.4354552924633026,1.0052796602249146,-0.7230340242385864,0.36283808946609497,-0.138401061296463,0.2897799611091614,0.5031830072402954,0.007262507453560829,0.19374865293502808,-0.44195619225502014,0.2267705202102661,-0.9691530466079712,0.4143560230731964\REUTERS\Google, Temasek investing in Indonesia's Go-Jek as ride-hailing rivalry deepens: sources\2018-01-18 13:48:11.0\
1512\Technology\SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] and Singapore’s top taxi operator ComfortDelGro Corp Ltd will launch a new ride-hailing service in Singapore from Friday, as they team up against their key regional rival Grab. UberFLASH, that will connect riders to drivers closest to them - either a private vehicle or a taxi, is the first collaboration between the firms since they said in December that ComfortDelGro would buy a 51 percent stake in Uber’s Singapore car leasing unit, Lion City Rentals. The deal comes at a time when Uber’s new Asia Pacific chief is prioritising collaborations with traditional taxi firms. It is expected to give Uber a leg up in its battle for market share with Grab, Southeast Asia’s dominant ride-hailing player. Grab has partnered with other taxi operators in Singapore. ComfortDelGro operated about 13,700 taxis in the city state as of November, official data shows, which is more than the fleet of all the other taxi companies combined. Uber’s Lion City Rentals has a fleet of about 14,000 vehicles. UberFLASH fares will be, on average, 5-10 percent cheaper than low-cost option UberX, Uber and ComfortDelGro said in a joint statement on Thursday. UberFLASH is already available in Thailand and Malaysia. ComfortDelGro’s acquisition of a majority stake in Lion City is waiting for approval from the Competition Commission of Singapore. The anti-trust regulator is reviewing the deal and recently sought public feedback on it.\-0.5096449255943298,-0.10257437825202942,0.10002973675727844,0.37496691942214966,0.554552435874939,0.25932806730270386,-0.07360552251338959,-0.760677695274353,-0.3921489417552948,-0.1913682371377945,0.17560651898384094,-0.30445465445518494,0.21171975135803223,-0.25509998202323914,-0.5997247695922852,-0.08971109241247177,-0.06634066253900528,-0.20135879516601562,0.49437233805656433,0.1552206128835678,0.08315955847501755,-0.2018330991268158,0.012020540423691273,-0.3893362879753113,0.28246596455574036,0.5156229138374329,-0.21442987024784088,0.5651214122772217,-0.32774901390075684,-0.1769150197505951,-0.3892163336277008,-0.6259532570838928,-0.07051678746938705,0.1814286708831787,0.42705318331718445,-0.05189387500286102,0.2325737178325653,-0.45597031712532043,1.216515064239502,0.03425358980894089,-0.4540713131427765,-0.1864227056503296,0.27024370431900024,-0.3958604335784912,-0.040359701961278915,0.4613151252269745,0.01042332872748375,0.5984324216842651,-0.28208744525909424,-0.3092445135116577,-0.27589598298072815,0.06608343124389648,-0.19134673476219177,-0.10214617103338242,0.28215014934539795,-0.1454097181558609,-0.15408192574977875,-0.24505917727947235,-0.6903137564659119,0.3617251217365265,0.9667409062385559,-0.6032824516296387,0.045410092920064926,0.09269841015338898,-0.46764394640922546,-0.755012035369873,0.579637885093689,0.3651104271411896,0.0339941531419754,0.06413586437702179,-0.2874774932861328,0.12253367155790329,0.0864914283156395,-0.5192462801933289,0.6278474926948547,-1.0440305471420288,0.3775097727775574,-0.32783496379852295,-0.021763112396001816,-0.21327894926071167,0.16335605084896088,-0.18094074726104736,-0.837739109992981,0.6773581504821777,-0.7869998216629028,0.45938846468925476,0.37629711627960205,0.2362610548734665,0.40932223200798035,-0.2678989768028259,0.3555079996585846,-0.026930348947644234,0.3786017596721649,0.09864647686481476,0.3925275206565857,-0.11524852365255356,-0.30569127202033997,0.14858384430408478,-0.8390390276908875,0.3199615776538849\REUTERS\Uber partners with taxi firm ComfortDelGro for new Singapore service\2018-01-18 09:18:46.0\
1513\Technology\SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), which has made waves in recent years buying art-house movies at the Sundance Film Festival, is heading to the prestigious event this week with a long-term change in the works: It plans to shift resources from independent films to more commercial projects, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The move reflects a new phase in the online retailer’s entertainment strategy. Initially, Amazon worked on high-brow movies that would win awards, put it on the map in Hollywood and help it attract top talent. Now, Amazon wants programming aimed at a far wider audience as it pursues its central business goal: persuading more people to join its video streaming service and shopping club Prime. The change in the movie strategy parallels a similar shift in Amazon Studios’ TV operation, which is also moving to bigger-budget fare. Amazon expects to go after films with budgets in the $50 million range at the expense of indie projects costing around $5 million, one person familiar with the plans said on the condition of anonymity. Another person confirmed the overall strategy, adding that the Culver City, California, studio is still working out the details on how much of its film budget will go to these bigger releases. Amazon declined to comment. The course change comes after Roy Price, who led Amazon Studios from its inception in 2010 and was a champion of projects with awards potential, resigned in October. Albert Cheng, the studio’s chief operating officer, has stepped in as interim head and is in charge of television projects, while Vice President Jason Ropell runs the film division. Both report to Jeff Blackburn, a Seattle-based senior vice president who wields broad authority at the company. It is unclear who will permanently replace Price. On the film side, Amazon is not moving all the way into blockbuster territory. The TV group had offered $250 million just for the rights to a fantasy prequel series of “The Lord of the Rings,” according to people familiar with the matter. That is a far more expensive project, representing a bigger change in direction than what the movie division is considering, one source said. Nor is Amazon abandoning indie films entirely. But industry sources are unsure how active the company will be at Sundance this year. The festival’s lineup is not believed to have a standout like “Manchester by the Sea,” which Amazon bought at Sundance for $10 million and which went on to win two Oscars. Amazon and rival Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) in general have pushed up prices for such prestige fare. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, recently told at least one industry executive that it is business as usual at the movie studio, a person familiar with the matter said. At Sundance, that could mean multi-million-dollar deals for films destined for theaters, as well as small deals by a separate team - Amazon Video Direct - that offers more modest payments for a project’s online streaming rights. Still, several filmmakers were surprised recently when the studio turned away a handful of projects with budgets up to $6 million, which they believed fit the mold of Amazon’s 2017 hit “The Big Sick,” another person familiar with the matter said. It was not immediately clear if their rejection was due to Amazon’s new priorities.\-0.4034286141395569,-0.025003161281347275,-0.03460937365889549,-0.504250168800354,0.45646411180496216,0.31641143560409546,0.20209075510501862,0.19472266733646393,-1.6932917833328247,-0.34198442101478577,-0.4845244288444519,0.5854580998420715,-0.4805363118648529,0.1954207569360733,-0.7410398125648499,0.6089648008346558,-0.7646978497505188,0.2832294702529907,-0.5019974708557129,-0.8468164205551147,0.3433973789215088,-0.37276095151901245,0.36589473485946655,0.10913102328777313,-0.7592556476593018,0.694377064704895,0.3242284059524536,0.2929626405239105,0.9922758936882019,-0.11976860463619232,-0.45445379614830017,0.35445982217788696,0.637100100517273,0.23681668937206268,-0.4379003942012787,-0.23070845007896423,0.25814035534858704,-0.08997318148612976,1.0166023969650269,-0.4329354465007782,-1.040216326713562,0.200905442237854,0.3551225960254669,0.02980400249361992,-0.6757646203041077,-0.56634920835495,0.2720632553100586,0.36526575684547424,-0.465114951133728,-0.3885895013809204,1.033821940422058,0.7556781768798828,-0.13657450675964355,-0.2549850642681122,0.701577365398407,0.023507393896579742,0.3135110139846802,-0.3540418744087219,-0.7078440189361572,0.8387160897254944,-0.20073182880878448,-0.5730445981025696,0.37668147683143616,-0.19980348646640778,0.07052382826805115,0.7669067978858948,-0.0464036650955677,0.41004639863967896,-0.5021804571151733,0.5699770450592041,1.040148377418518,0.5525531768798828,0.1688101887702942,0.4800659120082855,0.12666697800159454,0.889133632183075,-0.3005111813545227,-0.4168044328689575,-0.670062243938446,-1.8285377025604248,0.3613729774951935,-0.027454635128378868,-0.7005323171615601,1.2712396383285522,0.6063426733016968,-0.17000281810760498,0.5889914631843567,0.6341451406478882,-0.13399609923362732,0.07616563886404037,-1.2247035503387451,0.4118640124797821,0.09981603920459747,0.09101593494415283,0.1571447104215622,0.4715445935726166,-1.0278737545013428,-0.8898248076438904,-1.1077967882156372,-0.12638482451438904\REUTERS\Exclusive: Amazon Studios to cut back on indie films in programing shift: sources\2018-01-18 13:00:36.0\
1514\Technology\SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese online retailer JD.com will invest more than 20 billion yuan ($3.11 billion) in the country’s northeastern “rustbelt” regions over the next three years, the Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday, citing the company. JD said its efforts in the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang would be aimed at upgrading industries and creating jobs and would include the construction of an e-commerce settlement center that would create 9,000 jobs. China’s northeastern provinces, dominated by giant state enterprises and heavy industries, have struggled to keep up with rapidly growing high-tech manufacturing regions on the east coast. The central government has consequently rolled out plans to support the flagging region by launching major investment projects and encouraging companies in coastal areas to participate in reforms of state firms in the northeast.

1515\Politics\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress intensified efforts to pass a temporary extension in funding government operations and avert a shutdown, scheduling a vote on the measure for later Thursday. For months, the Republican-controlled Congress has been struggling to fund the government, which is now operating on its third temporary funding extension since the 2018 fiscal year began on Oct. 1. A vote on the bill is expected after 2:30 p.m. EST (1930 GMT), House Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said. Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber would take up the short-term funding measure as soon as the House approves it. Democrats insist that a long-term spending bill include a measure covering “Dreamers,” illegal immigrants brought to the country as children who were protected from deportation by former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Republican President Donald Trump ordered DACA to end in March and asked Congress to come up with a legislative fix. But bipartisan congressional negotiations with the White House faltered last week, prompting Republican leaders to begin pushing for the passage of a stopgap measure to fund the government through Feb. 16. The White House said on Wednesday it supported passage of a short-term funding measure and that immigration talks could resume next week. Republicans hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate and most legislation, including spending bills or an immigration deal, will require 60 votes to pass. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday said there was “revulsion” among his colleagues for the stopgap proposal in the House and an “overwhelming number” would not support it. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who is involved in the immigration negotiations, also said he would not vote for a short-term funding bill. His conservative colleague Mike Rounds told CNN on Thursday he could not back the current measure. It was also unclear whether Republicans had the votes in the House to pass a short-term fix since members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus prefer additional defense funding. The group’s leader, Representative Mark Meadows, told MSNBC television on Thursday there was not yet enough support among conservatives for the short-term funding measure. “We still don’t have the votes here in the House. We made good progress last night. Hopefully, we’ll get there today,” Meadows said, adding that he spoke with Trump on Wednesday night. “He does not want a shutdown. He made that very clear.” To entice lawmaker on both sides, the short-term bill would include a six-year extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to lure Democrats, while further delaying some taxes imposed under Obamacare to appeal to Republicans. But that appeared to draw ire from the president, who said in a tweet on Thursday: “CHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension!” White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Trump would still support the measure and sign it into law if it passes both chambers.\0.730728030204773,0.5179630517959595,-0.4250227212905884,-0.25452178716659546,1.524735927581787,-0.9696807265281677,0.46847596764564514,0.31758245825767517,-0.6994764804840088,-0.45670342445373535,1.6812101602554321,0.44734814763069153,-0.0996231660246849,0.7479981184005737,-0.49775823950767517,-1.1399521827697754,0.5200409293174744,0.8142377138137817,0.3433764576911926,-0.6289761662483215,0.03610866144299507,-0.29474329948425293,0.37578633427619934,-0.03239000588655472,-0.3158223032951355,0.2763098478317261,0.6694479584693909,0.4327630400657654,-0.20110009610652924,0.41275355219841003,-1.260864496231079,0.24333231151103973,0.6442766189575195,-0.38547003269195557,0.4369596242904663,0.7687342166900635,-0.6322035193443298,-0.46668756008148193,0.05567489564418793,-1.019461750984192,-0.05248919501900673,-0.36418417096138,-0.0505308099091053,-0.6716820001602173,-0.5504351854324341,0.04034963622689247,-0.4887254238128662,0.36326301097869873,0.8732203841209412,1.2373896837234497,0.3650255501270294,-0.028965851292014122,0.4249279499053955,-0.004850832745432854,0.08185988664627075,-0.5404880046844482,1.0394201278686523,-1.326427698135376,-0.8425647020339966,-0.22314222157001495,-1.2469403743743896,1.148821473121643,0.7310442924499512,-0.31732508540153503,-0.873491108417511,-0.11332771927118301,-0.2018982470035553,0.6220664381980896,-1.1452851295471191,1.3449703454971313,1.0060478448867798,-0.5653905272483826,-1.538232445716858,0.36920788884162903,-0.6003331542015076,-0.6299664378166199,-0.07092021405696869,1.292846441268921,-0.1400018334388733,0.34559696912765503,0.5957728028297424,0.9391811490058899,0.10290778428316116,-0.6532074809074402,1.0172948837280273,0.7886654138565063,0.4743419885635376,0.14706826210021973,-0.8811968564987183,-0.3086400032043457,-0.24321554601192474,-0.14953415095806122,-1.0896453857421875,-0.41488349437713623,0.06584323197603226,0.4695473611354828,-0.865003228187561,-0.6907117366790771,-0.5410633683204651,0.3732403516769409\REUTERS\Congress to vote Thursday for funding bill to avoid government shutdown\2018-01-18 15:42:03.0\1515, 1546, 1549, 1636, 1637, 1654
1516\Politics\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former White House strategist Steve Bannon was expected to return on Thursday to testify before the House of Representatives’ intelligence committee, two days after refusing to answer questions about his time with the Trump administration or the transition period leading to it. “He’s supposed to come back. Whether he will or not I can’t say,” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the panel, said in an interview with CNN. “This broad declaration that ‘I won’t answer questions’ - not just about the transition but anything that happened after the campaign including up to the present date - is unsustainable,” Schiff said. Bannon, a far-right, self-described nationalist, directed the final stage of President Donald Trump’s campaign and was a key presidential adviser until being fired in August. The rift between Bannon and Trump widened this month with the release of “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” a book that was highly critical of Trump and used Bannon as a prominent source. Bannon appeared before the House committee investigating Russian meddling in the election on Tuesday but refused to answer questions after his lawyer conferred with the White House and was told again to refuse to answer questions about the transition period immediately after Trump was elected or Bannon’s time in the administration, Schiff said. A lawyer for Bannon, William Burck, was not immediately available for comment. Bannon also struck a deal to be interviewed by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team, which also is investigating Russian meddling, rather than appearing before a grand jury, CNN reported on Wednesday. The New York Times had reported that he was subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury.

1517\Politics\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is finalizing its long-awaited infrastructure plan, which would push most of the financing of projects to private investment and state and local taxpayers, according to sources familiar with the proposal taking shape. President Donald Trump, who spoke frequently of improving U.S. infrastructure during his 2016 campaign, may preview the plan in his Jan. 30 State of the Union address, but details are not expected until afterward, the sources said. Two people briefed on it said it would likely recommend dividing $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years into four pools of funds. The administration is structuring the plan in hopes of encouraging $1.35 trillion in state, local and private financing to build and repair the nation’s bridges, highways, waterworks and other infrastructure, one source said. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobbying group in Washington, is even backing a 25 cent increase in the federal gasoline tax to make that happen. It is unusual for a business group to call for a tax increase, but the Chamber argues that it is necessary to fund critical infrastructure projects. “It’s time to invest in a 21st century infrastructure, a system of infrastructures to support and grow a 21st century economy,” said Tom Donohue, the Chamber’s president, in a speech on Thursday as part of the organizations renewed public push for action. “It’s time to make up for decades of underinvestment that today is evident in everything from bone-rattling potholes and endless traffic gridlock, to deadly train derailments and destructive water main breaks,” he said. The numbers in the Trump plan are still in flux and could change before he unveils it. The prospects of winning approval in Congress are uncertain given that Republicans have only a 51-49 majority in the Senate. Many Republicans want to use private-sector investment to finance infrastructure projects to avoid increasing the national debt. Democrats believe that government money is necessary to produce such a large package. Under the Trump plan being shaped, the largest share of the federal money - $100 billion - is expected to go toward cost-sharing projects with local governments, similar to grants. The goal would be to reduce the ratio of federal funding, which often now is 80 percent, by awarding funds only to projects that are able to provide more local funding or leverage private investment, said a business lobbyist familiar with the discussion. Some $50 billion would be earmarked for rural projects, the lobbyist said. Those funds would help governors on projects like roads, broadband access and replacing aging lead pipes. Including a pool for rural infrastructure could also reduce concerns among some Republican senators who fear rural areas may be unable to attract private investments. Twenty-five billion dollars would go toward existing federal infrastructure loan programs that seek to spur private investment, the lobbyist said. The final $25 billion would be designated for so-called transformative projects - an effort being dubbed “American Spirit” projects. They could include high-speed trains or the Gateway Tunnel, the stalled proposal to build a new rail connection between New York City and New Jersey. The plan may not deliver any additional federal money than in years past. The proposal could take $200 billion from existing spending plans – although the administration has not yet committed to whether it would come from existing programs or whether the money would be found elsewhere. The administration is unlikely to rule out any forms of funding - including increasing the federal gas tax or creating a vehicle mileage tax, which would put electric cars that now use the roads but do not consume much gasoline on the same footing as cars with internal combustion engines, sources said. Donohue made four recommendations for the infrastructure package including raising the gas tax and also recommended expanding the ability of states to access private investment funds to complete projects, reducing the federal permitting process and addressing state and local permitting rules. He also called for more federally backed workforce training - including more apprenticeship programs. As part of that, Donohue reiterated the Chamber’s call for passing comprehensive immigration reform, a proposal where business has been at odds with the Trump administration.\-0.03720017150044441,0.4825355112552643,-0.7927233576774597,-0.782011091709137,1.4494476318359375,-0.9820570349693298,-0.3659552335739136,-0.13760526478290558,-0.9785408973693848,-0.1469864845275879,-0.15227560698986053,1.8897032737731934,-0.009147819131612778,-0.07505923509597778,-1.2721136808395386,-0.420280784368515,-1.2456961870193481,0.3664257824420929,-0.7342773079872131,0.4689520299434662,0.5989331603050232,-0.22211939096450806,-0.5605714917182922,-0.06838563084602356,-0.012456746771931648,0.8354578614234924,-0.019907409325242043,0.5846588015556335,0.1272728145122528,-0.15374520421028137,-1.136087417602539,1.4437966346740723,0.991437554359436,-1.0365052223205566,-0.5767014622688293,-0.5746933817863464,-0.5269181728363037,-0.4746722877025604,0.0757094994187355,-0.14627830684185028,0.010853596962988377,-0.150043323636055,-0.6974714994430542,-1.4031764268875122,-0.6427303552627563,-0.10097450762987137,0.6919450163841248,1.0326141119003296,0.26982247829437256,1.0884758234024048,0.5618393421173096,0.7912430763244629,0.6942881345748901,0.3602775037288666,0.29970765113830566,0.33276158571243286,0.4222680628299713,-1.033502221107483,0.07611411809921265,1.0608727931976318,0.6172717213630676,-0.07171010226011276,0.05777473747730255,0.0028789713978767395,-0.7282258868217468,-0.10955771803855896,0.12337789684534073,0.7511880993843079,-0.7324924468994141,0.7756528854370117,0.8125859498977661,-1.2302873134613037,0.40040287375450134,-0.0929432064294815,-1.2229217290878296,0.3101003170013428,-0.4349980056285858,1.1466612815856934,1.6852840185165405,-1.2016278505325317,-0.7520145773887634,-0.1074991300702095,-1.225913405418396,0.3215464949607849,-0.15806962549686432,-0.3138703405857086,-0.11172958463430405,-0.7756125330924988,0.7414352297782898,-0.1572481095790863,-1.1719473600387573,1.0910799503326416,-0.2130195051431656,0.3992685377597809,0.6997272372245789,-0.4997228682041168,1.3751661777496338,-0.7021056413650513,-1.312595248222351,-0.22822174429893494\REUTERS\Trump administration's infrastructure plan taking shape\2018-01-18 16:36:55.0\
1518\Politics\SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. technology trade groups on Thursday urged the Trump administration to retain an Obama-era rule that allows certain spouses of highly skilled guest workers to also work legally in the United States. The call was made in a letter published on the website of the Information Technology Industry Council, whose members include Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft Corp. Ten other national business groups also signed the letter. The Department of Homeland Security indicated in a regulatory notice in December that it would at least partially undo the 2015 Obama administration decision granting work authorization to spouses of workers on H1b visas, which are used widely in the tech industry. In fiscal 2016, about 42,000 spouses, who entered the country on H-4 visas, were granted work authorization. The total exceeded 36,000 in the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a component of DHS. If the work authorization is repealed, H1b visa holders may move to countries where their spouses can legally work, said David Leopold, a partner at Ulmer & Berne LLP who specializes in immigration. “It’s a disincentive to stay here.” The DHS notice did not give specifics, but said the agency was reviewing the final rule in light of the April 2017 “Buy American and Hire American” executive order by President Donald Trump. In their letter, the groups urged the Trump administration to keep the rule in place, “not just to attract and retain talent, but to promote immigration to the United States on the basis of one’s skills and merit.” It noted that competitors, including Canada and Australia, allow accompanying spouses to work. Changes to the spousal work program could limit “our access as a nation to the most talented people who we need to help drive our economy,” said Dean Garfield, chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, in a telephone interview. Business groups that signed the letter include Compete America, CompTIA, the Council for Global Immigration, FWD.us, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Semiconductor Industry Association, the Society for Human Resource Management, TechNet and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. No decision about the rule will be final until the rulemaking process has been completed, said Joanne F. Talbot, a spokeswoman for USCIS, in an email. “USCIS is focused on ensuring the integrity of the immigration system and protecting the interests of U.S. workers, and is committed to reforming employment based immigration programs so they benefit the American people to the greatest extent possible,” Talbot said.\-0.40992262959480286,-0.138560950756073,0.6713147163391113,0.2755596935749054,-0.3952910602092743,-0.5064969658851624,0.13078473508358002,0.35360077023506165,-0.42121443152427673,-0.13611803948879242,-0.2967183589935303,0.09412156790494919,-0.4507727026939392,0.07371245324611664,-0.8002663254737854,-0.9183018207550049,0.061827048659324646,-0.12823136150836945,-0.42413148283958435,-0.5376771688461304,-0.5192186832427979,-1.0079180002212524,0.5464107394218445,-0.08993452787399292,0.04477914050221443,0.20774105191230774,-0.30527687072753906,-0.4568203091621399,1.0393059253692627,-0.33534789085388184,-0.6998706459999084,0.6146982908248901,-0.46544402837753296,0.20665715634822845,0.7646142244338989,-0.09769812971353531,-0.6769105195999146,0.1550097018480301,-0.44595232605934143,-0.6340739130973816,-0.29759907722473145,-0.17056415975093842,-0.34141233563423157,-0.7483611106872559,-0.6876264810562134,0.13206927478313446,-0.6058528423309326,0.6533892750740051,0.0032995897345244884,-0.22741422057151794,-0.10424456000328064,-0.3539983928203583,-0.6457116603851318,-0.3560476303100586,0.9275116920471191,0.3376730978488922,0.34919172525405884,-0.011003384366631508,-0.8973873257637024,1.1531050205230713,-0.03507615998387337,0.1274544894695282,0.137949138879776,-0.35228002071380615,-0.8034592270851135,-1.4035942554473877,-0.008105259388685226,0.6621852517127991,-0.8966127634048462,0.45562270283699036,-0.14472821354866028,-0.24254700541496277,0.056856025010347366,0.4214848577976227,0.06541352719068527,-0.31094619631767273,0.6144999265670776,0.4195363223552704,0.27360183000564575,-0.5178030133247375,1.1442573070526123,0.434332937002182,-0.32907938957214355,0.25360843539237976,0.9668399095535278,1.0047210454940796,0.9040953516960144,0.16817472875118256,-1.1481170654296875,-0.4808632433414459,-0.39399856328964233,0.3201826810836792,-1.0214461088180542,-0.017124271020293236,0.557659387588501,0.5595847964286804,0.4159702956676483,0.19126811623573303,-0.3759113848209381,0.21233901381492615\REUTERS\U.S. tech trade groups urge Trump to let spouses of H1b holders to work\2018-01-18 12:22:10.0\
1519\Politics\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said his concept of a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico “has never changed or evolved,” contradicting comments made by his chief of staff. White House chief of staff John Kelly told Hispanic lawmakers during a Wednesday meeting that some of Trump’s immigration views during the campaign were “uninformed,” according to reports in the Washington Post and New York Times. Kelly elaborated in an interview later with Fox News, saying that the Republican president’s views have evolved.” In an apparent rebuke of Kelly, Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday: “The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it.” The border wall stands at the center of a congressional struggle to overhaul immigration before the March expiration of a program protecting so-called “Dreamers” - immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children. Trump wants any deal to include funding for the wall, which Democrats oppose and is expected to cost more than $20 billion. During the campaign, Trump supporters cheered when he loudly promised a barrier along the 2,000-mile (3,200-km) U.S.-Mexico frontier to keep out drug smugglers and undocumented immigrants and have Mexico pay for it. Since taking office, he has acknowledged there were geographical barriers such as mountains and rivers along the border where a wall would not be necessary. “The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S.,” Trump said on Twitter on Thursday. Kelly told Fox News in an interview on Wednesday that the administration was considering visa fees and a renegotiation of NAFTA as ways to get revenue from Mexico.\0.15571606159210205,0.3757208585739136,-0.5418218374252319,-0.25782620906829834,0.6675119400024414,-0.7122858166694641,0.0026219410356134176,-0.22288168966770172,-0.3049488067626953,-0.19006212055683136,-0.2984697222709656,0.3554929196834564,-0.16666170954704285,0.15631802380084991,-0.2181818038225174,0.6075995564460754,-0.4968232810497284,-0.0352117083966732,0.032657697796821594,0.10716676712036133,0.5615840554237366,-0.16180405020713806,0.6760374307632446,-0.35936814546585083,-0.3830696642398834,0.3109862804412842,0.37257081270217896,0.5172266960144043,-0.5480824708938599,-0.10089462250471115,-0.19910669326782227,0.2642101049423218,0.2896987497806549,-0.09136179089546204,0.05465026944875717,0.8631032109260559,-0.20124764740467072,-0.06444474309682846,-0.27148157358169556,-0.32950666546821594,-0.027337215840816498,0.18811127543449402,0.5802246332168579,-0.5093792676925659,-0.7138276100158691,0.311479777097702,1.0839658975601196,0.24445784091949463,-1.3929013013839722,0.3433131277561188,0.6232773065567017,-0.2052304446697235,-0.1569748967885971,-0.25726503133773804,0.9040340781211853,-0.05095876753330231,0.1860755980014801,-0.9056057929992676,-0.7378703355789185,1.1608220338821411,-0.029788788408041,-0.10559241473674774,-0.2477557510137558,0.5203540325164795,-0.7419109344482422,0.19171340763568878,0.40504592657089233,0.08568260818719864,-1.104277491569519,0.3190334141254425,0.38768887519836426,0.004401741549372673,-1.0941840410232544,0.5700341463088989,-1.2605394124984741,-0.7530841827392578,-0.3260796070098877,0.6403095126152039,-0.8042016625404358,-0.1776789128780365,-0.2368488758802414,-0.0707741528749466,-0.634554386138916,0.1531459540128708,0.022668391466140747,0.2758174240589142,-0.20833227038383484,0.5448848009109497,-0.21625365316867828,0.43043944239616394,-0.3923361897468567,0.20694206655025482,-0.3019976317882538,0.2617064118385315,0.08420241624116898,-0.29611730575561523,0.11586413532495499,-1.0335137844085693,-1.2633525133132935,0.20183418691158295\REUTERS\Trump contradicts top aide, says border wall stance has not 'evolved'\2018-01-18 16:08:30.0\
1520\Politics\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he plans to devote much of his time this year to helping Republicans maintain control of the U.S. Congress, but suggested he may stay out of divisive intra-party primary fights. “I am going to spend probably four or five days a week helping people because we need more Republicans,” the Republican president said in an interview with Reuters. “To get the real agenda through, we need more Republicans.” Trump indicated he would avoid endorsing candidates in Republican primaries, as he did last year in Alabama’s Senate race, when the incumbent he endorsed was defeated by a hard-line conservative challenger, and would likely focus on the November general election in which Democrats are trying to wrest control of Congress from the Republicans. “It’s hard sometimes. Sometimes you really like three candidates - that’s a very tough position to be in. But we have places where I like all of the candidates,” Trump said. “But I will be very much involved with - beyond the primaries - with the election itself, very very much.” Trump is scheduled to travel to western Pennsylvania on Thursday in support of Rick Saccone, the Republican candidate in a special election to replace Republican U.S. Representative Tim Murphy, who resigned in October amid a sex scandal. Thirty-four seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives will be contested in November’s midterm elections. Democrats need to add a net total of two seats to assume control of the 100-seat Senate and 24 seats to take over the House. Fractious Republican primary battles already are developing in states including Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin, where some of the candidates are backed by Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief political strategist who he fired last August. Before Bannon had a public falling-out with the president over the former adviser’s comments in a new book about the Trump White House, the expectation had been that Bannon’s involvement might tempt Trump to interject himself into some those fights. Now that appears much less likely. Trump said he will tout during the campaign the Republican-backed tax overhaul law passed by Congress last month that slashed taxes for corporations and the rich while offering a mixed bag of tax changes to other Americans, a measure he argued would grow in popularity with voters as they see their taxes reduced in pay checks. The bill also opened up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to private oil drilling and repealed a provision of the Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, that imposed a fine on people who did not obtain health insurance. “Those were very, very big things,” the president said. “I think they’ll be very, very popular on the campaign trail.” He also plans to tout the performance of the stock market. “If the Democrats won the election, the stock market would have gone down 50 percent from where it was,” Trump said. Trump’s help could cut both ways for Republicans. In Reuters/Ipsos polls, Trump’s approval rating nationally has largely remained below 40 percent. His presence on the campaign trail could boost turnout of Democratic voters who want to register their disapproval of him. Democrats won an upset victory in conservative Alabama last month after Roy Moore, the candidate who beat Trump-backed incumbent Senator Luther Strange in the primary and was later backed by the president, lost to Democrat Doug Jones. In November, Trump-backed Republican candidate Ed Gillespie lost the Virginia governor’s race to Democrat Ralph Northam. Trump can help Republicans in other ways than campaigning. He remains the party’s most prodigious fund-raiser.\-0.3440139591693878,-0.663813591003418,0.14618074893951416,0.2473476231098175,1.4943889379501343,-0.7660073041915894,0.5420881509780884,0.31439706683158875,-1.1843868494033813,-1.4318265914916992,-0.33374518156051636,-0.24559766054153442,-0.18963100016117096,0.5090729594230652,-1.149238109588623,-0.14118912816047668,-0.41738346219062805,-0.9002934694290161,-0.6656513214111328,-1.222560167312622,-0.11656896024942398,0.06777507066726685,-0.3368145823478699,0.4461851119995117,-0.6549229025840759,1.2289152145385742,1.0804716348648071,0.11628700792789459,-0.20041611790657043,-0.05778597667813301,0.2631186842918396,-0.15051186084747314,-0.27383750677108765,-0.16838736832141876,1.0644930601119995,-0.05611235275864601,-1.5547055006027222,-0.38082650303840637,0.36338451504707336,-1.0876450538635254,-0.6457353830337524,-0.5426349639892578,0.23078934848308563,-0.6632267832756042,0.12693989276885986,0.5571105480194092,-0.2746644616127014,0.32641103863716125,-1.5392487049102783,0.21400286257266998,0.3328714966773987,0.30285555124282837,-0.2464645504951477,-1.1503777503967285,0.5910812020301819,0.14955846965312958,0.9108374118804932,-1.1244601011276245,-0.3486432433128357,0.32671675086021423,-0.36111339926719666,-0.8974778056144714,-0.07956404983997345,-0.3178093731403351,-0.8850151300430298,0.6194249391555786,-0.2876991033554077,0.4809195399284363,-1.2521884441375732,1.1370331048965454,0.7129544019699097,-1.7017958164215088,-0.2936713695526123,1.3482463359832764,-1.614320993423462,-0.4992767870426178,-0.6042543053627014,-0.21513478457927704,-0.15693508088588715,-0.25280997157096863,0.6101444363594055,-0.8116725087165833,-0.5475608706474304,-0.36216092109680176,-0.4677579998970032,0.4971098303794861,0.7090170383453369,0.8760561943054199,0.2501294016838074,-0.7249481678009033,-0.2436898946762085,0.5819739699363708,-1.0784372091293335,1.1627001762390137,1.1252201795578003,-0.24924281239509583,-0.5165759921073914,-1.4773846864700317,-0.4708305597305298,-0.8522539734840393\REUTERS\Exclusive: Trump vows to campaign intensively for Republicans, may avoid primaries\2018-01-18 12:37:21.0\
1521\Politics\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday aligned himself solidly with conservative Republicans on immigration, criticizing a proposed bipartisan deal as “horrible” on U.S. border security and “very, very weak” on reforms for the legal immigration system. The Senate proposal - aimed at addressing Democrats’ demands for protections for young adults brought to the United States illegally as children and dubbed “Dreamers” - fell far short of what most Republicans believe needs to happen, the president said. “It’s the opposite of what I campaigned for,” Trump told Reuters in an interview. The plan was presented to Trump last week by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin. Trump drew international condemnation after reports emerged that he had questioned the value of taking immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean nation of Haiti during a closed-door meeting with lawmakers at the White House last Thursday, referring to them as “shithole” countries. Trump has denied using that word. Trump in the interview on Wednesday declined to say what specific words he used. “I‘m not going to get into what I said, but I will tell you, it was a tough meeting,” Trump said. Many Democrats have said they will not vote for spending legislation to keep the federal government funded past a Friday deadline without an immigration deal, and Republicans will need at least some Democratic votes to pass the funding extension in the Senate. Trump said he thinks a deal on immigration is still possible. “Time is running out,” he said. Democrats said the negotiated plan addressed Trump priorities, including $2.7 billion for additional border security funding. “The president can’t seem to take yes for an answer and is heading toward a shut down, which would fall squarely on his back,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement emailed to Reuters. Trump said a federal government shutdown “could happen” at the end of the week, insisting Democrats would be blamed if that occurs even though Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. The White House has said it backs a short-term spending measure by a Friday deadline to prevent a shutdown. “HE MEANT WELL” Trump in September announced he was ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that protects the Dreamers, which was begun by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, effective in March. The program currently protects roughly 700,000 people, mostly Hispanic young adults, from deportation and provides them work permits. Trump has said he is open to finding a solution to help the Dreamers. But he said he became unhappy when Graham and Durbin, who had told him they had a compromise on the Dreamers issue, presented the details. But Ben Marter, a spokesman for Durbin, said on Friday that following an initial telephone conversation with Trump about the deal, the senator had been “encouraged” by Trump’s reaction and had expected further progress on the legislation at a White House meeting that day. Trump said he had called Republican Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue and Republican Representative Bob Goodlatte to join that meeting at the White House, describing them as “smart guys, with more of a conservative bent, more of a bent like I have.” As Graham and Durbin began describing the deal, Trump said, it was immediately clear it would be unacceptable to most Republicans. “It’s horrible for the security of our country,” Trump said, noting there was not enough funding for the wall he has promised to build on the U.S.-Mexican border, a project opposed by Democrats. The proposal was “very, very weak” on curbing visas for extended family members of immigrants, and failed to end a diversity visa lottery program. “Lindsey - he meant well - but I said, ‘Well, how many Republicans agree with this?'” Trump said. Trump blamed Durbin for leaking the language he used in the meeting, a disclosure that prompted critics to denounce Trump as a racist, an accusation he denied. “I’ve lost all trust in Durbin,” Trump said. Trump campaigned for president in 2016 promising a hard line on immigration, including deporting all of the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country and a “total and complete shutdown” of the entry of Muslims into the United States. As president, he has signed three orders banning entry of most people from several Muslim-majority countries as well as rescinding DACA.\0.36268454790115356,-0.010386542417109013,-0.4712180197238922,-0.12919266521930695,1.0563700199127197,-0.9007433652877808,0.2672669291496277,0.6853399276733398,-0.9533417224884033,-0.7238118052482605,1.0377618074417114,0.18804828822612762,-0.25152426958084106,0.07451216876506805,-0.8543394207954407,0.12366371601819992,0.11979388445615768,0.4700673520565033,-0.8044280409812927,-0.9578492641448975,0.5098078846931458,-0.7600894570350647,0.33800166845321655,0.2737419009208679,-1.2968727350234985,0.735244631767273,-0.6075108051300049,0.7367106080055237,-0.13434463739395142,-0.24122992157936096,-0.1451132595539093,0.2665253281593323,-0.3852827548980713,-0.13309988379478455,-0.19999924302101135,0.1345205456018448,-0.2244870811700821,-0.25154098868370056,0.777977705001831,-1.2308462858200073,-0.4804922938346863,-0.5091699957847595,-0.2653740346431732,-1.120012640953064,-0.7077297568321228,-0.6244238018989563,-0.1804131418466568,0.5571324229240417,-0.9156957864761353,0.7075549960136414,0.23820218443870544,-0.6199263334274292,0.4808143675327301,0.07947151362895966,1.193837285041809,-0.5918602347373962,-0.123532734811306,-0.47166547179222107,-0.9540889263153076,1.2078622579574585,-0.26595157384872437,-0.08289966732263565,0.08464334160089493,-0.6241350173950195,-0.7076659202575684,0.8690760731697083,0.32310131192207336,0.42143145203590393,-0.5750690698623657,1.652914047241211,0.5646663308143616,-0.5204989314079285,-0.5803518295288086,-0.5501892566680908,-1.8923797607421875,-0.5403702259063721,0.03156062215566635,0.08451417833566666,-0.3586918115615845,-0.4895525574684143,0.15320564806461334,-0.25109121203422546,-1.6180095672607422,-0.4570818543434143,0.4614620804786682,0.7938758730888367,0.6034892201423645,1.147027850151062,0.4647156298160553,-1.0788695812225342,0.3634907901287079,-0.11897525936365128,-0.9435689449310303,0.13648219406604767,0.1046203225851059,-0.14999163150787354,-0.15930233895778656,-0.6183158159255981,-1.453382134437561,0.3646543323993683\REUTERS\Exclusive: Trump takes hard line on immigration, rejects 'horrible' bipartisan plan\2018-01-18 03:12:21.0\1521, 1557, 1639, 1659
1522\Politics\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump complained on Wednesday that Russia was helping North Korea to evade international sanctions, signaling frustration with a country he had hoped to forge friendly relations with after his 2016 election win. “Russia is not helping us at all with North Korea,” Trump said during an Oval Office interview with Reuters. “What China is helping us with, Russia is denting. In other words, Russia is making up for some of what China is doing.” China and Russia both signed onto the latest rounds of United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea imposed last year. There was no immediate comment from the Russian embassy in Washington on Trump’s remarks. During a 53-minute interview with a fresh Diet Coke near at hand on his desk, Trump also said he was considering a big “fine” as part of an investigation into China’s alleged theft of intellectual property; that he has lost all trust in the chief Democratic Party negotiator on immigration in the Senate; and declined to clear up conflicting reports about his use of the phrase “shithole countries” in a White House meeting, which caused an international outcry. With North Korea persisting as the major global challenge facing Trump this year, the president cast doubt on whether talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would be useful. In the past he has not ruled out direct talks with Kim. “I’d sit down, but I‘m not sure that sitting down will solve the problem,” he said, noting that past negotiations with the North Koreans by his predecessors had failed to rein in North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. He blamed his three immediate predecessors, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, for failing to resolve the crisis and, a day after his doctor gave him a perfect score on a cognitive test, suggested he had the mental acuity to solve it. “I guess they all realized they’re going to have to leave it to a president that scored the highest on tests,” he joked. He declined to comment when asked whether he had engaged in any communications at all with Kim, with whom he has exchanged public insults and threats, heightening tensions in the region. Trump said he hoped the standoff with Pyongyang could be resolved “in a peaceful way, but it’s very possible that it can’t.” Asked whether he thought the United States needs more missile defense systems, he said, “Yes, yes I do. We’re ordering more missile defense and we’re ordering more missile offense also.” Trump praised China for its efforts to restrict oil and coal supplies to North Korea but said Beijing could do much more to help constrain Pyongyang. The White House last week welcomed news that imports to China from North Korea, which counts on Beijing as its main economic partner, plunged in December to their lowest in dollar terms since at least the start of 2014. ‘CLOSER EVERY DAY’ Trump said Russia appears to be filling in the gaps left by the Chinese. Western European security sources told Reuters in December that Russian tankers had supplied fuel to North Korea on at least three occasions in recent months by transferring cargoes at sea in violation of international sanctions. Russia has denied breaching North Korea sanctions. North Korea relies on imported fuel to keep its struggling economy functioning. It also requires oil for its intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear program. Trump has repeatedly blamed a U.S. investigation into whether Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election for hindering an improvement in U.S.-Russian relations. “He can do a lot,” Trump said of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “But unfortunately we don’t have much of a relationship with Russia, and in some cases it’s probable that what China takes back, Russia gives. So the net result is not as good as it could be.” Andrew Weiss, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Moscow does not share the depth of U.S. concerns over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. “It’s simply not the case, if Trump’s hands were not tied on Russia, that he and Putin could magically work together to solve the Korea crisis.” Trump said Pyongyang is steadily advancing in its ability to deliver a missile to the United States. “They’re not there yet, but they’re close. And they get closer every day,” he said. North Korea said after its last intercontinental ballistic missile launch in November that the test had put the U.S. mainland within range. Some experts agreed that based on the missile’s trajectory and distance it had the capability to fly as far as Washington D.C. They said, however, that North Korea had not yet offered any proof that it had mastered all technical hurdles, including development of a re-entry vehicle needed to deliver a heavy nuclear warhead reliably atop an ICBM. Trump said he welcomed talks between North and South Korea over the Winter Olympics to be held in the South next month and said this could be an initial phase in helping defuse the crisis. He would not say whether the United States has been considering a limited, pre-emptive attack to show the North that the United States means business. “We’re playing a very, very hard game of poker and you don’t want to reveal your hand,” he said. ‘TOUGH-TALKING’ Trump also gave the clearest indication yet that his administration will take retaliatory trade action against China. Trump and his economic adviser Gary Cohn, who was also in the Oval Office, said China had forced U.S. companies to transfer their intellectual property to China as a cost of doing business there. The United States has started a trade investigation into the issue, and Cohn said the United States Trade Representative would be making recommendations about it soon. “We have a very big intellectual property potential fine going, which is going to come out soon,” Trump said. Trump said the damages could be high, without elaborating on how the numbers were reached or how the costs would be imposed. WASHINGTON IS “A MEAN PLACE” Trump was also asked about a private gathering with a bipartisan group of senators last week at which he was reported to have used a vulgar term to describe Haiti and African nations. He would not confirm whether he had said “shithole countries,” but described it as a “tough-talking” meeting. He said he had “lost all trust” in Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, one of the participants who later talked publicly about Trump’s comments during the meeting. Trump criticized a proposed bipartisan deal on protecting children of illegal immigrants from deportation, calling it “horrible.” A deal was still possible by a March 5 deadline but that “time is running out,” he added. Speaking a day after his doctor recommended diet and exercise to lose 10-15 pounds (4.5 to 6.8 kg), Trump said he would prefer dieting by eating smaller portions than exercise. “I get exercise. I mean I walk, I this, I that,” Trump said. “I run over to a building next door. I get more exercise than people think.” As for the central lesson he has taken away from a year in the White House, Trump said: “I love Washington, but it’s a mean place, it’s a very deceptive place.”\1.2670563459396362,0.6262586116790771,0.2824707329273224,1.4610905647277832,0.07356662303209305,-0.5432853102684021,0.5583480596542358,0.4242778718471527,-0.38379448652267456,-0.8048697710037231,0.554414689540863,0.6059564352035522,-0.22586962580680847,0.7519022226333618,-0.5483959317207336,-0.8075805306434631,-0.011875802651047707,0.5251973867416382,-0.9405326247215271,-1.3506231307983398,0.7052889466285706,-0.5251754522323608,0.3063810169696808,-0.0021188436076045036,-1.07695734500885,-0.3819074332714081,0.8193529844284058,0.5069819092750549,-0.45443466305732727,-0.7773755192756653,-0.2642346918582916,0.7365447878837585,0.6106219291687012,0.5355625152587891,-1.014359474182129,0.43161895871162415,-0.051997847855091095,-0.011248760856688023,1.7272496223449707,0.08931934088468552,-0.3356088399887085,-1.0119317770004272,0.8131281733512878,-0.462709903717041,-0.5858349204063416,0.40681394934654236,0.7503257989883423,0.8810489773750305,-1.246694803237915,-0.5238678455352783,1.1580982208251953,0.878248929977417,-0.6415897011756897,-0.37263917922973633,1.1030118465423584,-0.6240058541297913,0.7600276470184326,0.4724416732788086,-1.3279722929000854,0.9027196764945984,0.7200595736503601,-0.7654058933258057,0.4414183497428894,-0.39856699109077454,-1.6972317695617676,0.5704487562179565,2.44497013092041,0.3638584017753601,-1.4281702041625977,0.7474215626716614,0.31317007541656494,-0.9402844905853271,-0.5588880181312561,1.1894599199295044,-2.0851917266845703,-0.9331054091453552,1.0651265382766724,-0.9934206604957581,-1.4163206815719604,-0.12622548639774323,0.3674757182598114,1.0586620569229126,-0.8273528218269348,0.1327483206987381,1.1629079580307007,-0.7774240374565125,1.0346206426620483,-0.03311363235116005,-0.5244154930114746,-0.17292852699756622,-1.202918291091919,-0.49094268679618835,-1.3364213705062866,-0.2121502012014389,1.0401803255081177,-0.5713824033737183,-1.3992043733596802,-0.6765040755271912,-1.9148104190826416,-0.06030065566301346\REUTERS\Exclusive: Trump accuses Russia of helping North Korea evade sanctions; says U.S. needs more missile defense\2018-01-18 01:44:44.0\1661, 1552, 1577
1523\Politics\WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Jeff Flake castigated President Donald Trump on Wednesday for his attacks on the media, saying Trump had embraced the despotic language of former Soviet dictator Josef Stalin and inspired modern-day authoritarians. In a rare intra-party rebuke from the Senate floor, Flake said Trump’s portrayal of the press as “the enemy of the people” and repeated White House references to “fake news” and “alternative facts” had spurred copycats such as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Stalin, who led the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until he died in 1953, used the phrase “enemy of the people” to describe those he wanted annihilated. Trump’s use of the phrase “should be a source of great shame,” Flake said. Flake, 55, an Arizona conservative who has frequently feuded with Trump, described himself in October as out of step with his party and said would not seek re-election. His term ends in January 2019. “Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press, but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians. ... This is reprehensible,” Flake said. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, responding to Flake’s speech, said the senator was an attention-seeker. “He’s not criticizing the president because he’s against oppression,” Sanders said at a White House briefing. “He’s criticizing the president because he has terrible poll numbers and he is, I think, looking for some attention.” Trump’s attacks on the media in response to critical stories about him have been a staple of his Twitter feed and he tweeted in February 2017 that “The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American people!” That same month, Assad was quoted as dismissing charges of human rights violations at a military prison as “fake news.” In the Philippines, Duterte lashed out on Tuesday at a “fake news outlet” known for challenging his government. Noting Trump had said he will give out awards for “the most corrupt and dishonest” media, Flake said: “It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle.” Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday evening that his “FAKE NEWS winners” could be found on the Republican National Committee website. The link, which was broken for 90 minutes, listed 10 stories by news outlets. An 11th item was coverage of “RUSSIA COLLUSION!” that Trump called a “hoax.” In a second Twitter post, Trump said there were also “many great reporters I respect.” The other Republican senator from Arizona, John McCain, aimed similar criticism at Trump on Wednesday in an opinion piece in the Washington Post. “Trump continues his unrelenting attacks on the integrity of American journalists and news outlets,” wrote McCain, who is fighting aggressive brain cancer. “This has provided cover for repressive regimes to follow suit.” In his clashes with Trump, Flake has called his behavior sometimes “reckless, outrageous and undignified” and criticized the president in a book that made the New York Times best-seller list last year. On Twitter, Trump has referred to the senator as “Flake(y)” and said Flake dropped his re-election bid because he was doomed to lose. He also has called Flake ineffective, “toxic” and weak on issues such as crime and border security. Still, Flake has voted for Trump’s policies. He supported Republican tax overhaul legislation last month and voted for unsuccessful bills to repeal and replace Obamacare, both efforts backed by Trump. Flake laid some “official untruths” at Trump’s door on Wednesday and said the most vexing was his labeling as a “hoax” the investigation of alleged ties between Russia and Trump’s presidential campaign. “To call the Russia matter a ‘hoax’ ... is a falsehood,” Flake said. “We know that the attacks orchestrated by the Russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat,” he said. “It is in the interest of every American to get to the bottom of this matter.”\0.8572090864181519,0.48700034618377686,-0.5782425403594971,0.6853373646736145,0.7063930034637451,-0.9573879241943359,0.9404873847961426,0.39613741636276245,-1.3001031875610352,-0.7494451999664307,-0.4818480610847473,-0.27437976002693176,-0.6402484178543091,0.03091164492070675,-0.3173033595085144,0.673120379447937,0.05494895204901695,0.3237549066543579,-0.32439205050468445,-1.4934114217758179,0.16665472090244293,-0.6583996415138245,0.14166414737701416,0.5684440732002258,-1.656893014907837,0.6842381358146667,0.7574051022529602,0.8893958926200867,-0.6913703083992004,0.14714287221431732,0.8795529007911682,-0.37693604826927185,-0.22461670637130737,0.7534590363502502,0.681275486946106,0.503602147102356,-0.8921940922737122,0.047513447701931,0.2877748906612396,-0.2081310749053955,0.11476383358240128,-0.8014515042304993,0.7766578793525696,-0.798869788646698,-0.5489403605461121,0.498232364654541,-0.2639058232307434,0.589887261390686,-1.3892748355865479,-0.7346217036247253,1.2268896102905273,-1.0355205535888672,-0.3077966272830963,0.6143603324890137,1.7632246017456055,-0.7809538245201111,0.5930517911911011,-0.267856627702713,-0.5038910508155823,0.8123703598976135,-0.01740199141204357,-0.2671544551849365,-0.3228800296783447,0.3958130478858948,-1.1652052402496338,0.5198911428451538,1.0824832916259766,-0.10029621422290802,-2.0031001567840576,0.8676912188529968,0.20584632456302643,-0.8499758839607239,-0.5252847671508789,-0.18987798690795898,-1.8791390657424927,-0.3082678020000458,0.8012740015983582,0.653795063495636,-0.5992349982261658,-0.5294827818870544,0.1279483586549759,1.2880885601043701,-0.8751238584518433,0.07004407048225403,-0.14980092644691467,0.44697174429893494,0.7681553363800049,0.571061909198761,0.21900542080402374,-0.08244640380144119,0.9224908947944641,-0.2982228696346283,-1.6261177062988281,0.1573105752468109,-0.19494840502738953,0.5004952549934387,-0.5785878896713257,-1.1892204284667969,-1.1601951122283936,-0.9254066944122314\REUTERS\U.S. senators rip Trump over his attacks on the media\2018-01-18 04:26:03.0\

1525\Technology\LONDON (AP) - Researchers say a major hacking operation tied to Lebanon’s main intelligence agency has been revealed after careless spies left hundreds of gigabytes of stolen data exposed to the open internet. Mobile security firm Lookout, Inc. and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said in a joint report published Thursday that the haul includes nearly half a million intercepted text messages and sensitive data on thousands of individuals across the world. They say it had simply been left online by hackers linked to Lebanon’s General Directorate of General Security. The report says digital clues show that the GDGS building was a central node in the spying operation. The GDGS declined to comment ahead of the report’s publication. \-0.1211438775062561,-0.267311155796051,0.09714138507843018,-0.03186113387346268,-0.005591392517089844,0.5706634521484375,0.3484577536582947,-0.2596730887889862,-0.49096888303756714,0.002255513798445463,0.26170799136161804,-0.0021161669865250587,0.3283238112926483,-0.16026920080184937,-0.22971633076667786,0.30089712142944336,-0.26904234290122986,0.3585871160030365,0.32828524708747864,-0.16069073975086212,0.34862035512924194,0.14195728302001953,0.0985722690820694,0.025807321071624756,-0.39176028966903687,-0.12869150936603546,0.4118140637874603,0.03378778323531151,0.6537066698074341,-0.09006119519472122,-0.6530512571334839,-0.13374295830726624,-0.3069368302822113,0.1500375121831894,-0.09824149310588837,-0.1640610247850418,0.10049068182706833,-0.4668850004673004,0.005198483355343342,-0.16057910025119781,-0.3384643495082855,-0.25277507305145264,-0.002013117540627718,-0.05207602307200432,0.35534119606018066,-0.44269490242004395,0.4172656834125519,0.6674737334251404,-0.00202069990336895,0.17194370925426483,0.17105969786643982,-0.030702749267220497,0.2580419182777405,-0.060502901673316956,0.009019142016768456,-0.06441178917884827,-0.35978347063064575,0.006136407144367695,-0.33422961831092834,0.25415197014808655,0.14913833141326904,-0.066567063331604,-0.22855094075202942,0.05406830832362175,-0.48348501324653625,-0.5571495294570923,0.7084972262382507,0.8775182962417603,0.21337857842445374,0.09844913333654404,-0.04463856667280197,0.2017354965209961,0.23570236563682556,0.11630230396986008,0.06799287348985672,-0.36759793758392334,-0.12011280655860901,-0.25384512543678284,-0.06269505620002747,-0.602053165435791,0.27074524760246277,-0.4760538935661316,0.16002999246120453,0.8636898994445801,0.13078010082244873,-0.11975152790546417,-0.13459858298301697,0.08608357608318329,-0.2684921324253082,-0.04875236004590988,0.2584347724914551,-0.15270215272903442,-0.4311368763446808,0.17240077257156372,0.0029635934624820948,0.08055101335048676,0.5831404328346252,-0.2899206876754761,-0.319791704416275,0.07421378046274185\WASHINGTONTIMES\Researchers: Hacking campaign linked to Lebanese spy agency\2018-01-18 16:04:18.0\
1526\Technology\BEND, Ore. (AP) - All seven Deschutes County law enforcement unions have filed a joint complaint with local leaders, and one has filed a state complaint that a new digital radio system installed in July works so poorly it puts their lives and those of the public at risk. KTVZ-TV reported Wednesday that a Dec. 7 letter from the unions to law enforcement leaders calls for immediate action “to fix serious problems” with the radio system. The problems listed include volume levels that are too low, dropped radio signals and garbled radio transmissions. Deschutes County 911 Director Steve Reinke confirmed the problems and said the system wasn’t properly configured by the provider, Harris. Harris spokeswoman Natalie Ciao said in a statement that a Harris team has been in Bend since early January and will continue working with the city and county to address challenges and optimize the system’s performance. ___ Information from: KTVZ-TV, http://www.ktvz.com/ \-0.4854821264743805,-0.04450225085020065,0.0010123040992766619,0.31571635603904724,0.22874560952186584,0.25143569707870483,0.8973254561424255,0.22548043727874756,-0.7079813480377197,-0.32490602135658264,-0.45194077491760254,0.23780973255634308,-0.39619746804237366,-0.012211475521326065,-0.338079035282135,-0.34744003415107727,0.008584768511354923,-0.32411858439445496,0.05551962926983833,-0.6479783654212952,0.011689774692058563,0.13904236257076263,-0.22893373668193817,0.15760132670402527,-0.496759295463562,0.25680649280548096,0.3012193739414215,0.04185488075017929,0.7329517006874084,-0.5719185471534729,-0.39750951528549194,-0.4896334409713745,-0.22025491297245026,-0.051494572311639786,-0.19898812472820282,-0.15073183178901672,0.9573550224304199,-0.0877116471529007,1.0808755159378052,0.2815566658973694,-0.47405529022216797,0.030932659283280373,-0.46204835176467896,-0.23168344795703888,-0.37086308002471924,-0.6696327328681946,-0.150918647646904,0.19911499321460724,-0.10814263671636581,-0.600767195224762,0.2513154447078705,0.05133345350623131,0.4089328348636627,-0.14348499476909637,-0.04920492693781853,-0.48541897535324097,-0.11090801656246185,0.3629676103591919,-0.6905075907707214,0.6308107972145081,-0.4200807213783264,0.07239825278520584,-0.12246374785900116,0.07695149630308151,0.12848985195159912,-0.02619432471692562,0.44266989827156067,0.7664830684661865,0.2862170338630676,0.11901833862066269,0.1649756133556366,0.008535368368029594,0.12456624209880829,-0.10007040202617645,0.08583517372608185,-0.8385160565376282,-0.5187984704971313,-0.17944945394992828,0.006858262233436108,0.12393061071634293,0.3941734731197357,0.2859773635864258,0.009433464147150517,-0.21144911646842957,-0.14656980335712433,0.10492188483476639,-0.2821912467479706,0.12015670537948608,0.9472543001174927,-0.20708665251731873,0.10933578014373779,-0.07018082588911057,-0.4567601680755615,-0.10613006353378296,-0.3165796399116516,-0.19317522644996643,-0.39945298433303833,-0.11200116574764252,-0.8134185671806335,-0.2839553654193878\WASHINGTONTIMES\Police unions: New radio system puts lives at risk\2018-01-18 15:16:07.0\
1527\Technology\Speed cameras placed in work zones around the Capital Beltway have raked in more than $3 million in fines in just six months, but some Maryland officials worry that the tickets aren’t doing enough to discourage repeat offenders. In July, Maryland’s State Police, Department of Transportation (MDOT) and State Highway Administration set up speed cameras in work zones along Interstates 95 and 495 in Prince George’s County. Since then, the SafeZones Program has issued 75,000 citations, fining speeders $40 for exceeding the 55 mph speed limit by 12 mph or more. “To be frank with you, I thought there would be more tickets,” said John Townsend, spokesman for the AAA MidAtlantic automobile owners club. “When I looked for the numbers, I expected to have 100,000 tickets.” According to a 2016 MDOT study, about 6.3 million motorists use the Beltway each month, so 75,000 speeders represent a small fraction of the highway’s traffic. However, a sizable portion of those speedsters have been cited and fined multiple times in the SafeZones. “Thirty-nine percent of drivers ticketed are repeat offenders,” Mr. Townsend said, noting that is the same percentage the Wall Street Journal found during an investigation of speed cameras two years ago. The State Highway Administration said in an email that the main goal for SafeZones is to “slow drivers in work zones to make work zones safer for our workers, drivers and passengers.” With the program now reporting a 90 percent reduction in work zone speeding statewide, that aspect of the program could be considered a success. But the cameras apparently have had little effect on repeat speed demons. One reason could be that SafeZones fines motorists $40 regardless of how many times they are caught speeding and the fines do not impact a driver’s record or insurance. The fines system may have been a boon for generating revenue — AAA estimates that Maryland has collected $112 million in fines since its speed-camera program began in 2010. But it also means that work zones remain a dangerous place for drivers and workers alike. Last year, six people died in work zone crashes in the state. AAA is not the only one looking at this fast and furious trend. In Maryland’s General Assembly, Delegate Mark Chang, Anne Arundel Democrat, introduced this month a bill calling for fines against repeat speeders to double. The bill, HB0014 or “Vehicle Laws — Work Zone Speed Control System — Increased Penalty for 3 Multiple Offenses,” proposes fining drivers $80 for their third ticket in the same year. The State Highway Administration was unable to comment on the bill, but a spokesperson confirmed that the agency is aware of it. The bill is scheduled to receive a hearing Jan. 25. \0.29723069071769714,-0.7231640219688416,-0.5634216070175171,0.835059404373169,-0.44349417090415955,-0.7178030610084534,0.5276077389717102,0.4682856798171997,-0.09007289260625839,-0.5905925631523132,0.9197587966918945,0.5071250200271606,-0.9315117001533508,-0.3624511659145355,-1.2503440380096436,0.15372051298618317,0.09312310814857483,0.02354331500828266,-0.2068607360124588,0.7857027053833008,0.883588433265686,-0.20191317796707153,0.45304980874061584,0.07290710508823395,0.07707002758979797,0.28945332765579224,-0.052957404404878616,-0.24398435652256012,-0.5324289798736572,-0.36903515458106995,-0.42387527227401733,-0.07385942339897156,0.03036845289170742,0.7281099557876587,-0.5008538961410522,-0.149470716714859,-0.19015717506408691,-0.6421995162963867,0.0405089296400547,0.0904061421751976,0.22460082173347473,-0.1541745662689209,-0.5102044939994812,-0.5004718899726868,-0.25040021538734436,0.6724823117256165,0.7504934072494507,0.056304626166820526,0.250276654958725,-0.5745931267738342,1.4789677858352661,-0.7928579449653625,9.43689257837832E-4,0.2671947777271271,0.6173081398010254,-0.30777445435523987,0.07704414427280426,0.30908307433128357,-1.4781538248062134,0.3478371798992157,0.11119261384010315,0.46624836325645447,0.335625022649765,-0.35255447030067444,0.07484197616577148,0.18621696531772614,-0.058401238173246384,0.8070369362831116,-0.584481418132782,1.1545891761779785,1.2140898704528809,0.42870378494262695,-0.4017530381679535,-0.05767718702554703,-0.931225597858429,-0.28930145502090454,-0.2800518572330475,0.13804969191551208,-0.14584112167358398,0.3652447760105133,0.12673832476139069,0.5349989533424377,0.06581276655197144,0.0014436723431572318,-0.33415111899375916,-0.10062601417303085,-0.30079951882362366,-0.11424864828586578,-0.004694932606071234,-0.3944823145866394,-0.9062851667404175,0.06684649735689163,0.1659439653158188,0.7322140336036682,0.03177677467465401,0.7130393981933594,0.47197920083999634,-1.2727123498916626,-0.14556267857551575,0.47497519850730896\WASHINGTONTIMES\Beltway speed cameras take $3 million in fines, but repeat offenders persist\2018-01-18 04:09:09.0\
1528\Technology\DETROIT (AP) - The CEO of France-based automaker PSA Group says it will offer 40 electric models across its lineup by 2025, and it plans to sell vehicles in the U.S. within 10 years. Carlos Tavares told the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit on Wednesday night that PSA already offers mobility services in the U.S. and soon will start car-sharing in some major cities. It will use its experience to learn the market and return to U.S. sales. Such an approach “will minimize the risk of not understanding what the U.S. consumer is expecting from us,” he said. Tavares wouldn’t say exactly when the company that makes Peugeot and Citroen vehicles will come to the U.S. or which brand it will offer. PSA, which is Europe’s No. 2 automaker, completed a $2.5 billion takeover of the Opel and Vauxhall brands from General Motors last year. Tavares said the Opel brand will develop products for the U.S. The company plans to start meeting with auto dealers in the U.S. this year as it considers how it will distribute its vehicles, Tavares said. “If you want to be a global player, you have to be there,” he told the group. Tavares said all models from each of PSA’s five brands will offer an array of power systems including at least one electric vehicle. It was not clear whether those would be fully electric or gas-electric hybrids. \0.35153186321258545,0.3414311408996582,-0.025303009897470474,-0.2708631753921509,0.9653056263923645,-0.08598816394805908,0.7513878345489502,0.1757490485906601,-0.16215968132019043,-0.3974790573120117,0.03688502684235573,0.45515039563179016,-0.34923917055130005,-0.20617949962615967,-0.2588938772678375,0.3863235414028168,-0.7506687641143799,-0.28420764207839966,-0.12097106128931046,0.5441267490386963,0.1766677051782608,0.3338083326816559,0.265526682138443,-0.13349385559558868,0.8866937160491943,0.03611891716718674,0.3673827350139618,-0.20534399151802063,0.27447497844696045,-0.20011283457279205,0.12178287655115128,0.04476470127701759,-0.033815208822488785,-0.25616002082824707,0.3019430935382843,-0.47587066888809204,-0.5523042678833008,0.11818860471248627,0.08938229084014893,0.4732668101787567,-0.09984540939331055,-0.2770698666572571,0.341229110956192,-0.19955100119113922,-0.4098922610282898,-0.8468961119651794,-0.2775052487850189,0.6047292947769165,-0.4780433773994446,0.6147310137748718,0.547407329082489,-0.24676713347434998,0.04980822280049324,0.22521376609802246,0.17184938490390778,-0.057696014642715454,0.17933540046215057,0.7198202610015869,-0.18497130274772644,-0.22616884112358093,-0.022900788113474846,-0.41688278317451477,-1.0308393239974976,0.31233763694763184,-0.7198724746704102,-0.3720879554748535,0.4550829827785492,0.37092408537864685,-0.7076179385185242,0.2917502820491791,0.17465877532958984,0.14250701665878296,-0.8109496831893921,0.6339846849441528,-0.11569233238697052,-0.012950921431183815,-0.602453351020813,-0.1851842850446701,-0.12735916674137115,-0.44918930530548096,0.2872501313686371,0.37375608086586,-0.480540931224823,0.5490220785140991,-0.2835826873779297,-0.17749077081680298,0.4612891674041748,-0.43985047936439514,-0.5610607266426086,-0.05862654373049736,-0.15599870681762695,0.41007348895072937,-0.483358234167099,0.6654803156852722,0.035686347633600235,0.15665337443351746,0.41424334049224854,-0.02702721767127514,-0.9013213515281677,0.053784407675266266\WASHINGTONTIMES\France's PSA Group to offer 40 electric vehicles by 2025\2018-01-18 03:22:39.0\
1529\Technology\VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) - The Virginia Beach Development Authority is investing $500,000 toward a local company’s bitcoin “mining” facility. The Virginian-Pilot reports the city awarded the money Tuesday to BCause LLC, which is investing nearly $65 million toward its facility. Though bitcoin was classified as a legal, convertible decentralized virtual currency in 2013 by the U.S. Treasury, its price was falling Wednesday as some countries reported they may ban cryptocurrencies. One bitcoin is worth about $10,000. Company founder Tom Flake says the data center will be the largest in North America, bringing about 100 full-time jobs to the area with an average annual salary of $60,000. He said patrons will be able to lease mining machines for around $5,000 a year. The operation is set to be up and running by next week. ___ Information from: The Virginian-Pilot, http://pilotonline.com \0.055229552090168,-0.24634943902492523,-0.531983494758606,-0.42095082998275757,0.2707001864910126,-0.5554889440536499,-0.6346697807312012,-0.2614803612232208,-0.3830285966396332,-0.23975592851638794,0.14802028238773346,-0.12151318043470383,-0.006733964197337627,-0.11699727177619934,-0.9362743496894836,-0.04617583751678467,-0.63780277967453,0.009115729480981827,-0.23681668937206268,-0.2641764283180237,0.639866828918457,0.28183719515800476,-0.19703704118728638,0.4167639911174774,-0.217799574136734,0.1504223793745041,-0.036310844123363495,0.15829461812973022,-0.17772610485553741,0.4902157485485077,-0.12634441256523132,-0.12686270475387573,-0.33993926644325256,-0.6736227869987488,0.3652229309082031,-0.1706121861934662,-0.19023580849170685,-0.3536895513534546,-0.007959905080497265,0.06695055216550827,0.2194751352071762,-0.01726246066391468,0.48706766963005066,0.06210323050618172,0.07343978434801102,-0.6616039276123047,0.3645091950893402,0.487650990486145,-0.8201526403427124,-0.35233044624328613,0.35040047764778137,-0.05254942923784256,0.3862798511981964,0.12611466646194458,0.20589740574359894,-0.039831604808568954,-0.09431522339582443,0.4926692545413971,-0.1658320128917694,1.1151528358459473,0.42914316058158875,-0.22650504112243652,0.37929514050483704,0.015718577429652214,-0.03275977447628975,0.26162469387054443,3.264579572714865E-4,0.9806910157203674,0.18247389793395996,0.30570805072784424,-0.18684618175029755,0.21546103060245514,0.48331618309020996,0.261456161737442,0.2348484843969345,-0.08512440323829651,-0.6042786836624146,0.2010442316532135,0.02423122338950634,-0.10528207570314407,-0.5186939239501953,-0.06863280385732651,-0.20693117380142212,0.3858906328678131,-0.08007409423589706,-0.2301952838897705,-0.16806545853614807,-0.1281704306602478,0.11337153613567352,-0.32181352376937866,0.3146546185016632,0.5064363479614258,-0.43057769536972046,-0.39777153730392456,-0.15327243506908417,0.008221912197768688,-0.08549579232931137,0.153898686170578,-0.08610974252223969,0.2720610201358795\WASHINGTONTIMES\Virginia city invests $500K in bitcoin 'mining' facility\2018-01-18 02:57:04.0\
1530\Technology\The web site for President Trump’s “fake news awards” crashed around 8 p.m. Wednesday as the president announced the much-anticipated event on Twitter. To nobody’s surprise, CNN made the dubious awards list four times, and the New York Times twice. Mr. Trump provided a link to the web site GOP.com with a showman’s flourish by commenting on Twitter, “And the FAKE NEWS winners are…” It linked to a web site with a list of 11 news reports, but many users couldn’t access the site, apparently due to heavy demand. Fox News posted the list of “winners”: 1st — The New York Times’ Paul Krugman claiming markets would “never” recover from a Trump presidency. 2nd — ABC News’ Brian Ross’ bungled report on former national security adviser Michael Flynn. 3rd — CNN’s report that the Trump campaign had early access to hacked documents from WikiLeaks. 4th — TIME’s report that Mr. Trump removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office. 5th — The Washington Post’s Dave Weigel tweeting that Mr. Trump’s December rally in Pensacola, Florida, wasn’t packed with supporters. 6th — CNN’s video suggesting that Mr. Trump overfed fish during a visit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 7th—CNN’s retracted report claiming Anthony Scaramucci-Russia ties. 8th — Newsweek’s report that Polish First Lady Agata Kornhauser-Duda did not shake Mr. Trump’s hand. 9th — CNN’s report that former FBI Director James B. Comey would dispute Mr. Trump’s claim he was told he was not under investigation. 10th — The New York Times’ report that the Trump administration had hidden a climate-change report. 11th— In Mr. Trump’s words, “RUSSIA COLLUSION!’ Russian collusion is perhaps the greatest hoax perpetrated on the American people. THERE IS NO COLLUSION!” The web site asserted that “studies have shown that over 90 percent of the media’s coverage of President Trump is negative.” It called 2017 “a year of unrelenting bias, unfair news coverage and even downright fake news.” The president had promised supporters that he’d honor “the most corrupt & biased of the Mainstream Media,” after having pushed back the original date from Jan. 8. On Twitter, Mr. Trump followed up the announcement by saying, “Despite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage, there are many great reporters I respect and lots of GOOD NEWS for the American people to be proud of!” “ISIS is in retreat, our economy is booming, investments and jobs are pouring back into the country, and so much more! Together there is nothing we can’t overcome—even a very biased media. We ARE Making America Great Again!” the president tweeted. Ahead of the announcement, Arizona’s Republican senators, Jeff Flake and John McCain, criticized the president for feuding with the media. \0.6035873293876648,-0.18394577503204346,0.6704407334327698,0.82227623462677,0.47181499004364014,-0.008451870642602444,0.5807548761367798,0.1626570075750351,-0.7807728052139282,-0.34445831179618835,0.5134044289588928,-0.1474202275276184,-1.5502859354019165,-0.05076706409454346,-0.6861550211906433,-0.13926784694194794,0.6710634827613831,0.1378166675567627,-0.4317077696323395,-1.0385175943374634,-0.07248551398515701,-0.16219468414783478,-0.1890385001897812,0.06202040612697601,-1.110182762145996,0.9303909540176392,1.2692718505859375,-0.18266591429710388,-0.6592962741851807,-0.9885373115539551,0.5512738227844238,0.28336700797080994,-1.1277437210083008,-0.40292251110076904,1.2061001062393188,0.6163168549537659,-0.9210973978042603,-0.6749035120010376,0.16360872983932495,-0.10252736508846283,-0.7848941087722778,-0.1907065510749817,0.3872947096824646,-0.7925462126731873,0.9675368666648865,-0.2125527709722519,0.4276721179485321,0.010884452611207962,-1.056125283241272,-0.4587675929069519,1.0937234163284302,0.14089278876781464,-0.2264244556427002,-0.6901084184646606,0.8497294783592224,-0.5048885941505432,0.03721383959054947,0.5398442149162292,-0.7643141746520996,0.5793460011482239,-0.1313784271478653,-0.2658756673336029,0.2126493752002716,-0.8308016657829285,-0.6290033459663391,0.21834354102611542,1.0017409324645996,-0.27950289845466614,-1.0492873191833496,0.9594139456748962,-0.02119622565805912,-0.4818301498889923,-0.4402925372123718,0.7950944900512695,-0.7629285454750061,-0.11899096518754959,0.2633388042449951,0.2752172648906708,-0.7419375777244568,-0.06668488681316376,0.05628310143947601,0.3502081334590912,-0.07163654267787933,0.37961649894714355,0.5275634527206421,0.6916749477386475,0.1483677476644516,0.4945737421512604,0.7420147657394409,0.09288610517978668,0.8711040019989014,-0.35494446754455566,-1.6342440843582153,-0.06040388345718384,0.2477114349603653,-0.2221982181072235,-0.24637344479560852,-1.003966212272644,-0.5478850603103638,-0.6141681671142578\WASHINGTONTIMES\CNN, New York Times top Trump's list of 'fake news' awards\2018-01-18 02:44:38.0\
1531\Technology\Director Denis (“Arrival”) Villeneuve took viewers back into the world of replicant permanent retirement last year through a lumbering but cerebral sequel to Ridley Scott’s 1982 sci-fi cinematic masterpiece. Now available in ultra-high definition, Blade Runner 2049 (Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, rated R, 164 minutes, 2.39:1 aspect ratio, $35.99) dives in 30 years past the original to introduce a new breed of Blade Runner from the Los Angeles Police Department, still out to exterminate the unpredictable bioengineered android mistakes of the Tyrell Corp. Specifically, replicant agent KDS-3.7 (Ryan Gosling) is still hunting the Nexus 8 models when he learns of a “skinjob” that may have given birth. The revelation will turn him from the hunter into the hunted as he avoids corporate kingpin Niander Wallace’s (Jared Leto) goons and seeks out the legendary Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) to learn the truth about his origins and the possible evolution of the biorobotic humanoids. The slow-burning plot, played out over almost three hours, quietly dives in character revelations, appreciation of the odd beauty of urban wastelands in a post-apocalyptic world and is occasionally interrupted with some exciting violent interludes. Notable performances also include Dave Bautista as the burly replicant Sapper Morton, Ana de Armas as KDS-3.7’s holographic companion Joi, Robin Wright as Lt. Joshi and Sylvia Hoeks as Mr. Wallace’s android muscle Luv. Throughout, the film maintains the noirish and cyberpunk themes of the original. It also delivers another round of questions about what it means to be human through the complex actions and injected memories of the replicants and the citizens surviving in the squalor of what remains of the U.S. west coast. Before watching the latest film, I would highly recommended enjoying the original “Blade Runner,” especially the final-cut version released last year on 4K UHD (Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, rated R, 164 minutes, 2.39:1 aspect ratio, $41.99) to learn more about Mr. Scott’s original themes, and the story featuring some of the classic characters seen in the current movie. 4K UHD in action: The digital transfer from the 4K master source to ultra-high definition with its high dynamic range enhancements offers a reference quality package for home entertainment lovers. However, despite the upgrades, the movie often mires in the bleak, locations often wrought with pollution and rain so viewers will need to appreciate the visual punches when available. It could be as simple as clearly seeing a replicant’s serial number engrained on its eyeball, noticing the dirty fingernails of characters, or watching smoke blowing through a three-dimensional hologram, ever so slightly warping the image’s hue. The color pop will also impress. Memorable moments include the multistory, 3-D interactive holographic ads peppering Los Angeles, colors on a villain’s digitally painted fingernails or, best of all, KDS-3.7 walking through the smoky, glowing orange atmosphere of an irradiated Las Vegas, littered with massive broken statues of naked women. I’ll also mention the Dolby Atmos, sensory-surrounding soundtrack that rumbles throughout. Having one of the famed flying police cars hovering near a farmhouse sounds like a 747 landing in an entertainment room setting. Best extras: Let’s skip the production featurettes for a minute and focus on the three included, though previously released to the Internet, short films that act as prologues for the main event. First, a 16-minute animated short item from acclaimed anime director Shinichiro Watanabe leads the pack offering the story behind the epic Blackout of 2022. It featured a group of renegade Nexus 8 model replicants unleashing an EMP (electro magnetic pulse) on major cities that shut down all machines and erased all electronic records and communications. The stylish and mesmerizing animation style and excellent recreation of “Blade Runner” landscapes makes it a perfect complement to the main movie. Another pair of live-action shorts (roughly six minutes each) offers director Luke Scott’s introduction of Mr. Wallace’s pitch to the government for a new replicant model (set in 2036) and the woes of a Nexus 8 replicant Sapper looking for a peaceful existence set in the year 2048. What’s left is roughly 50 minutes of featurettes covering casting choices, production design and a too-promotional look at the mythology in the sci-fi universe. Interviews abound in the segments led by Mr. Villeneuve with words from Mr. Gosling, Mr. Ford, writer Hampton Fancher, executive producer Ridley Scott and even Syd Mead, (original concept artist) who was asked to imagine a dirty, bombed Las Vegas. \1.0682008266448975,0.21243467926979065,-0.1907627433538437,-0.13467787206172943,-0.6575443148612976,-0.08747081458568573,0.05095808580517769,0.1359555423259735,-1.385606288909912,0.34982380270957947,0.2732570469379425,-0.12355993688106537,-0.09799141436815262,1.5850290060043335,0.13596057891845703,0.8238886594772339,0.2640506625175476,-0.03272995352745056,0.1911594122648239,-0.114906907081604,0.041276007890701294,-0.4175075888633728,0.3434086740016937,-1.2891925573349,-0.8746243119239807,0.44503986835479736,1.772173285484314,0.7754729390144348,-0.2995488941669464,-0.23124969005584717,-0.19340397417545319,1.5835202932357788,-0.9737654328346252,0.7109057307243347,-0.1648862510919571,-0.02476559393107891,-0.4583696126937866,0.8041530847549438,-0.742204487323761,-0.056277208030223846,-0.30395349860191345,-0.6840438842773438,0.5904566049575806,-0.3504987955093384,-0.7317342162132263,0.41966161131858826,-0.5125112533569336,0.10463850945234299,-0.6103927493095398,-0.49289917945861816,1.9975709915161133,-2.0409724712371826,-0.2771206200122833,-1.4394742250442505,0.669631838798523,0.2414059042930603,0.346530020236969,1.0254729986190796,-0.985808253288269,-0.4603655934333801,-0.32835742831230164,0.14526095986366272,0.47099798917770386,-1.5022518634796143,-0.3554067313671112,0.4748271107673645,0.12728743255138397,1.2587088346481323,-1.072485327720642,-0.16654154658317566,0.779986560344696,0.23022934794425964,-1.255859136581421,0.686780571937561,0.08344148844480515,0.05595855414867401,-0.4947271943092346,-1.147558331489563,-0.5626903176307678,-0.42029157280921936,0.21447908878326416,-0.3605780601501465,0.17451795935630798,0.8060716390609741,0.7631237506866455,0.20693345367908478,1.506287932395935,0.5611616373062134,-0.9328338503837585,-0.5983090400695801,-0.6045833230018616,1.418341040611267,-0.9700560569763184,0.2332848459482193,0.6064407825469971,0.21076524257659912,-0.017176827415823936,-0.7434427738189697,-0.4330645203590393,0.38242822885513306\WASHINGTONTIMES\'Blade Runner 2049' review (4K UHD)\2018-01-18 00:30:45.0\
1532\Technology\OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - The Latest on an Oklahoma lawmaker’s discovery of a tracking device affixed to his vehicle (all times local): 5 p.m. A Republican lawmaker who discovered a high-tech tracking device affixed to his truck initially told police he suspected someone connected to the wind industry may be responsible. Police in the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore on Wednesday released a report detailing state Rep. Mark McBride’s discovery of the tracking device on his vehicle. A longtime supporter of oil and gas and a frequent wind industry critic, McBride told a Moore police officer that he was writing legislation that could negatively affect Oklahoma wind farms. District Attorney David Prater says the tactics could be criminal and that he believes the potential impact of legislation on certain industries could be a motive for “something a bit nefarious.” Telephone messages left Wednesday with Oklahoma Wind Coalition officials weren’t immediately returned. ___ 3:50 p.m. A Republican lawmaker’s discovery of a magnetic box containing a high-tech tracking device affixed to the bottom of his truck is being investigated by Oklahoma officials, who also revealed that four other GOP legislators have reported concerns they were being followed. The mysterious discovery has stunned Oklahoma’s political class, and raised questions about who would spy on lawmakers. Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater described the tactics as “foolish” and potentially criminal. He vowed an aggressive prosecution if evidence suggests someone was trying to intimidate Rep. Mark McBride, who found the device on his truck. McBride says he found the experience “unsettling” and believes it is connected to his legislative work. Prater says four other GOP legislators approached him last year with concerns that they were being followed. \0.17106057703495026,-0.722675621509552,-0.7545492649078369,0.14859087765216827,0.20300592482089996,0.6055300235748291,0.17898967862129211,0.41564691066741943,-1.2452417612075806,-0.8105646371841431,-0.3010910749435425,0.11276765167713165,-0.27363353967666626,-0.3710392415523529,-0.3799278140068054,-0.21408851444721222,0.06682633608579636,0.03605680167675018,-0.28046390414237976,-0.37301120162010193,0.2561315894126892,-0.8371986746788025,0.6967611908912659,-0.8054816722869873,-1.0072317123413086,0.6554895639419556,0.5532421469688416,0.4277825951576233,-0.6156827211380005,0.2661522328853607,0.1807558238506317,1.1478835344314575,-0.29141178727149963,-1.0428252220153809,0.4377477467060089,-0.11268754303455353,-0.5963103175163269,-0.29463234543800354,-0.001995466183871031,-0.7631914019584656,0.059014566242694855,-0.277730256319046,1.8696681261062622,-0.5482802391052246,-0.5265951156616211,0.2682720422744751,0.16330449283123016,-0.3901354968547821,-1.499220609664917,-0.9493266344070435,0.7371615767478943,-0.3855878412723541,-0.5965691208839417,0.1352706104516983,0.4434713125228882,-0.02429649606347084,1.1810969114303589,0.6964386105537415,-0.6805452108383179,0.9945789575576782,-0.3342217206954956,-0.1527920663356781,-0.139366015791893,-0.5592291355133057,0.466346800327301,0.5835937261581421,-0.3795732259750366,0.20424561202526093,-0.5985812544822693,-0.2388792335987091,0.32561251521110535,0.012046446092426777,0.3811323344707489,0.5428531169891357,-0.019063683226704597,-0.3686642348766327,-0.3621705174446106,0.7092368006706238,-0.6563715934753418,-0.9867151379585266,-0.055178772658109665,0.5387640595436096,-0.9281465411186218,0.1348683387041092,0.6259960532188416,-0.3433414101600647,0.1594613641500473,0.3963387906551361,0.04550771042704582,-0.3248155117034912,9.99737181700766E-4,1.113098382949829,-0.06515447795391083,0.10677402466535568,0.5132920742034912,-0.43270209431648254,-0.024754445999860764,-0.7292945981025696,-0.6215344667434692,-0.22417794167995453\WASHINGTONTIMES\The Latest: Lawmaker suspects wind industry in spying case\2018-01-18 00:28:13.0\
1533\Technology\HONOLULU (AP) - Nearly 40 terrifying minutes passed between the time Hawaii officials fired off a bogus alert about an incoming missile over the weekend and the moment the notice was canceled. The state was slow to contain the situation, waiting 23 minutes to call officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to get unnecessary approval to send a retraction. That call lasted for about one minute, a state emergency official said Wednesday, but residents and visitors still didn’t receive the corrected alert until about 14 minutes later. The confusion - and panic - have raised questions about whether any state should be solely responsible for notifying the public of such an event - especially as Washington and North Korea trade insults and threats. Hawaii is the only state in the nation with a pre-programmed alert that can be quickly sent to wireless devices if a ballistic missile is heading toward the U.S. FEMA said Hawaii did not require its approval to cancel the alert on Saturday. U.S. Reps. Colleen Hanabusa and Tulsi Gabbard, both of Hawaii, have asked the House Armed Services Committee to hold a hearing on the issue. They said in a letter to the committee Tuesday that it’s understandable for states to have primary jurisdiction over warnings for floods, hurricanes and other natural disasters. “However, when it comes to matters of national security, including whether a ballistic missile has been launched against the United States, one must question whether any state emergency management agency is best suited for that role,” the letter says. The debate comes as North Korea claims it is testing weapons that could deliver a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile to Hawaii, Guam and even the U.S. mainland. The two networks that were activated in Hawaii were the Wireless Emergency Alert and the Emergency Alert System , both of which use a federal system to send messages to people in certain geographic areas. The systems can be used by state and federal agencies for weather events, natural disasters, law enforcement notifications and alerts issued by the president. Signal carriers allow people to block alerts from state and law enforcement agencies, but not those issued by the president. “The decision to send a national alert directly to the public rests with the president,” FEMA spokeswoman Jenny Burke told The Associated Press in an email. FEMA has the ability to send alerts to targeted audiences but has not yet taken on that responsibility, said Daniel Gonzales, a senior scientist at RAND Corp. who was contracted by Homeland Security to study the Wireless Emergency Alert. Gonzales said under the current system, it makes sense for states to handle alerts because they may be more familiar with local needs. But he acknowledged that since no state except Hawaii has a prepared message, it could take other states as long as 30 minutes to create, enter and distribute one. In addition, there is uncertainty about how long it takes for an alert to make its way to all cellphones since the nationwide system for mobile devices has never been tested, Gonzales said. He said the process could add another five minutes, further cutting into the time that people have to prepare for a disaster. Sending a national alert could cause more problems than a targeted alert, he said. “I think you want to be careful about not causing panic everywhere,” he said. In case of a real launch, U.S. Pacific Command would notify Hawaii state officials, who would then activate their warning systems for residents and visitors. It is estimated that a ballistic missile would take about 20 minutes to reach Hawaii from North Korea. State officials say it would take about five minutes for the military to analyze the launch trajectory, leaving only 12 to 15 minutes of warning time for residents. There has never been a national emergency warning sent to mobile devices, radio or television, FEMA said. The agency has conducted three tests of the national public warning system for radios and television only. President Donald Trump did not make any public comments about the false alert on Saturday. He was at his golf club in West Palm Beach, accompanied by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Asked about the alert on Sunday, the president said it was “a state thing.” “I love that they took responsibility. They took total responsibility,” Trump said. “But we’re going to get involved. Their attitude and their - what they want to do, I think it’s terrific. They took responsibility. They made a mistake.” Trump acknowledged people’s fears, saying that “part of it is that people are on edge, but maybe, eventually, we’ll solve the problem so they won’t have to be so on edge.” U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz met with members of Hawaii’s congressional delegation and officials from several federal agencies Wednesday to discuss the issue. He said it’s important that people have faith in the warning system and that the state has a long way to go to rebuild trust. ___ AP writers Darlene Superville in Washington and Jennifer Kelleher in Honolulu contributed to this report. \0.7296372056007385,-0.24923798441886902,-0.7846759557723999,0.38706040382385254,0.0726061761379242,0.26698535680770874,1.1125859022140503,-0.905673623085022,-0.681117832660675,-0.9373823404312134,0.04204751178622246,1.0127688646316528,-0.5457379221916199,1.0896873474121094,-1.571000099182129,-1.3823463916778564,0.3905906081199646,0.13012799620628357,0.010807237587869167,-1.5468281507492065,0.6054114699363708,0.12328928709030151,-0.5490842461585999,-0.4665050208568573,0.07267586141824722,0.44786909222602844,1.4266663789749146,0.18780437111854553,-0.5929566025733948,0.043940916657447815,-0.6391121745109558,0.8723109364509583,-0.08959517627954483,-0.47464850544929504,0.5778949856758118,-1.0202240943908691,0.23931296169757843,-0.9584346413612366,1.168896198272705,-0.6247602701187134,0.028130659833550453,-1.0290250778198242,0.5581019520759583,-0.7367054224014282,-0.9599364995956421,0.008825630880892277,0.9693195819854736,0.07558517903089523,-0.8484786748886108,-0.036653392016887665,0.7832416892051697,-0.2668725550174713,0.1450311839580536,0.31396692991256714,2.0688538551330566,-0.8483371138572693,1.8536561727523804,-0.5457377433776855,-1.697462797164917,0.9349688291549683,-0.49653100967407227,1.0902878046035767,-0.519865870475769,-0.0224602073431015,-0.42795702815055847,0.3748925030231476,1.0692520141601562,1.7709506750106812,-0.40135449171066284,0.5579897165298462,0.8326271176338196,-0.4879818856716156,0.5196698307991028,-0.13796016573905945,-1.134123682975769,-0.5051249265670776,0.7164846658706665,0.5334656238555908,-0.7951828837394714,-1.1572465896606445,1.4460893869400024,1.1760990619659424,-1.9861952066421509,1.1496357917785645,1.114451289176941,0.5535101890563965,-0.42999571561813354,0.4044176936149597,-0.062297895550727844,0.9243860840797424,-0.15516215562820435,1.0062483549118042,-1.785150170326233,-0.6475088596343994,0.2242717444896698,0.19474190473556519,0.17422807216644287,-1.3926831483840942,-0.6686921119689941,0.03371502459049225\WASHINGTONTIMES\Lawmakers ask if states or feds should alert about missiles\2018-01-17 23:38:08.0\
1534\Technology\Junaid Hussain, an Islamic State operative considered one of the terror group’s top recruiters prior to being killed in an August 2015 airstrike, sent bomb-making instructions three months earlier to a New York City man who said he wanted to attack Times Square or the Statue of Liberty, federal prosecutors claimed in a recent court filing. Hussain allegedly provided the instructions to Munther Omar Saleh, a 21-year-old Queens resident who faces sentencing next month for charges including attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue wrote in a filing entered last week in the government’s case against Saleh and his co-defendant, 22-year-old Fareed Mumuni of Staten Island. “On May 7, 2015, Saleh emailed himself information regarding the construction of a pressure cooker bomb, like that used in the Boston Marathon terrorist attack in 2013. Saleh had received these instructions from Syria-based ISIS attack facilitator Junaid Hussain. These instructions included lists of components that could be used to construct a pressure cooker bomb,” the prosecutor wrote. “During the post-arrest interview, Saleh further stated he was talking to individuals at the highest levels of ISIS,” Mr. Donoghue wrote for the Justice Department in a Jan. 12 filing first reported by Newsweek on Tuesday. “Hussain provided Saleh with a document with instructions for making a pressure cooker bomb. Saleh remarked that the instructions seemed ‘pretty doable’ to him, and that as long as he had a remote detonator and fireworks, he could assemble a pressure cooker bomb ‘instantly.’” Mr. Saleh considered building a bomb to target either of two of New York City’s biggest landmarks, according to messages recovered from his cellphone cited in the government’s court filing. “i was considering that The statue of liberty has a very weak point in its lower back and its tilting forward, if i can get a few pressure cooker bombs to hit the weak point, i think it will fall face down, along with the mushrikeen [those who worship one other than Allah] visiting it,” he wrote Hussain on May 7, 2015, the government alleged. “Or we can hit times square which would be easier, but if i can get more akhs [brothers], we can preform simultaneous attacks all around NYC.” Most of Hussain’s responses were deleted before the conversation could be accessed by authorities, according to the government. Mr. Saleh and Mr. Mumuni were arrested before they could strike, and each faces up to 56 years in prison when they’re sentenced February 8 in connection with previously entered guilty pleas. Hussain was raised in Birmingham, England, and he first gained notoriety as a teenage member of TeaMp0isoN, a hacking group credited with several high-profile cybersecurity incidents that occurred in 2011, including breaches suffered by the likes of far-right English Defence League, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, among others. He ultimately served several months behind bars in 2012 for a hacking-related conviction prior to traveling to Syria the following year and joining ISIS. He subsequently conducted social media operations and recruitment efforts for the terror group prior to being killed in 2015, roughly three months after his conversations with Mr. Saleh. He was 21. The Justice Department has previously implicated Hussain in ISIS-inspired terror attacks, including the 2015 shooting that targeted an anti-Islamic cartoon contest in Garland, Texas. \-0.31765249371528625,0.08151251077651978,-0.2620795965194702,0.02019462361931801,0.05135815963149071,0.5213915109634399,0.07372607290744781,-0.016606880351901054,-1.304168939590454,-0.8102942705154419,-0.6101526618003845,0.2195640206336975,-0.7899991869926453,0.40453672409057617,-0.3295955955982208,0.1902129054069519,0.9513938426971436,0.11656541377305984,0.020497210323810577,0.42550262808799744,0.4253605902194977,-0.10717259347438812,-0.6683036088943481,0.2121150642633438,-0.9577407240867615,-0.21708454191684723,0.8959048390388489,0.8857261538505554,0.5428531765937805,0.4300353229045868,-7.264952291734517E-4,1.242988109588623,-0.07222707569599152,0.6858777403831482,0.04499509930610657,-0.9135059714317322,0.6801687479019165,0.19772742688655853,0.1298040747642517,-0.43674901127815247,-0.39401713013648987,-0.995863139629364,0.2332998663187027,-0.5147045254707336,0.1624145209789276,-0.46030935645103455,-0.0845501646399498,-0.39530467987060547,-2.135221004486084,-0.9270081520080566,-0.060092903673648834,-0.994742751121521,-0.6215930581092834,0.3068309426307678,0.8771186470985413,-0.41942736506462097,0.8843606114387512,0.176834836602211,-0.6754151582717896,-0.21459318697452545,0.20600277185440063,0.11947782337665558,0.28872305154800415,-0.15645065903663635,0.2903873920440674,0.25779131054878235,0.5062729716300964,0.3589119017124176,-0.6399206519126892,0.3555189371109009,0.18426513671875,-0.0908023864030838,-0.9965516328811646,-0.03279266506433487,-0.8594359159469604,-0.5225147008895874,-0.7227656245231628,0.5472715497016907,-1.1573294401168823,0.6919135451316833,0.26141777634620667,-0.19224515557289124,-0.5473999977111816,-0.47623610496520996,0.5062150955200195,-0.49535220861434937,0.7904923558235168,0.5071090459823608,-0.3851553201675415,0.46158427000045776,0.20817965269088745,1.2621662616729736,-1.5308873653411865,-0.4514327347278595,-0.14693620800971985,-0.26598885655403137,-0.5106860995292664,-0.6439507603645325,-1.0385754108428955,0.5306742191314697\WASHINGTONTIMES\Islamic State recruiter advised NYC resident on foiled terror plots: DOJ\2018-01-17 23:32:05.0\
1535\Technology\Recent editorials from Georgia newspapers: ___ Jan. 16 Savannah Morning News on a new information technology corridor: A state senate committee recently recommended Savannah as a premier destination for a new information technology corridor, a victory for ongoing efforts to strengthen the area’s workforce. Georgia Sen. P.K. Martin (R-9) chairs the Senate Information Technology Corridors study committee, and the Coastal Empire wasn’t on the committee’s radar when it began work. Savannah quickly rose to one of two cities named after work from local champions. Augusta also made this list. The Georgia Cyber Innovation and Training Center is currently under construction in Augusta. The center will provide cyber security awareness, training and education to state agency information security officers. Plans are for it to open in July. The state investment there for the center alone is $35 million and will only increase. It’s time for the same investment in Savannah. From the training at Georgia Tech-Savannah’s ATDC to the fledgling companies finding a perch at Bull Street Labs, the local potential for this scale of development and investment is high. The demands of the logistics industry alone should be enough to get attention, but there’s so much more in the business and everyday culture to feed what could be a thriving business plan for the area. Savannahian Keith Fletcher, chief operating officer for local technology firm Speros, helped present our case to the state. He says groups key to the new designation are logistics and hospitality industries, where the impact could draw high-tech jobs that could pay more than $100,000 each. Also crucial to the effort will be gigabit-speed broadband, a qualified workforce, education, transportation and a good quality of life. Savannah scores high on most of those points but still has work to do on the education and workforce area - two pieces that are currently targeted by the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camps underway locally to increase quickly the number of work-ready coders. If the training pace of that single program continues, 200 skilled coders will be in the workforce in less than five years. Any graduates of Georgia Southern University, Savannah State University and SCAD with those skills would be in addition to that number. The Georgia Tech Advanced Technology Development Center-Savannah stands ready to help small and large businesses learn and expand. Patrick Bentley, Emerging Industries Project Manager for the Savannah Economic Development Authority, says this type of work also has the potential to help solve one of the area’s critical problems: poverty. It’s crucial to reach students early with technology and engineering education, and that’s the only way to raise standards over time. Not all jobs high-tech brings require a college degree. A technology corridor is a great idea, but it will require a team focused on recruiting and nurturing local students by showing them all the possibilities. We hope Georgia Southern, with its added weight now in Savannah on the Armstrong campus, will use its engineering and health professional schools’ muscle to help inspire those who might look to tech fields. Bentley warned in a recent Savannah Morning News story that we must be focus locally. “We push to make the city attractive,” he said. “but if we don’t include the local workforce, you raise standards and locals can be inadvertently left out. We have to include training for our jobs.” He was also right that building a feeder tech corridor is a long-term solution. “Savannah has all the raw materials, but it’s a long-term fight,” Bentley said. Now that Savannah is on the map, so to speak, follow-through is up to the state and next steps may include committee recommendations that the state legislature become more involved and aware of the “constantly changing information technology industry.” Only one thing is lacking - a leader. There’s no organized effort for the Savannah area to keep the momentum the study brings. The work now includes identifying the groups and geography to encourage collaboration and innovation. It’s time for the local government, legislators and companies with vision to gather the information the state will need to create the corridor and make the idea a reality that pays dividends for generations. Online: http://savannahnow.com/ ___ Jan. 15 The Augusta Chronicle on former U.S. congressman Doug Barnard Jr.: Doug Barnard Jr. was not only one of the last of the country’s great statesmen, but at 95 he outlasted statesmanship itself. Our nation’s capital had long ago ceased benefiting from the Augusta Democrat’s brand of gentlemanly statecraft - he left Congress after eight terms in 1993. But this area was treated to another quarter-century of his distinguished presence, his down-home warmth and his fatherly friendship. “Doug Barnard is the ideal role model for anyone who feels a call to public service,” said Danny Craig, former district attorney and current Superior Court judge. “He exuded enthusiasm, optimism, energy, and encouragement.” “Doug Barnard was the epitome of what a public servant should be,” added local lawyer David Hudson. “It was always a delight to see Doug ‘work a room.’ Whether it was before church on Sundays, when he was out to dinner, or attending a civic event, Doug would go from person to person, table to table, always with a smile and a cheerful greeting. “To put it simply - he was beloved.” “I remember how he always focused on other people,” said Ashley Wright, also a former district attorney and current Superior Court judge. “He asked questions to get people to tell them about themselves, their lives, their businesses, and then, when they felt comfortable talking with him, their needs and wants. He was a gentleman in the true sense: he put others before himself, he served his community, and he was so humble.” Barnard’s professional and political legacies will live on. A banker by trade and once chief aide to governor and childhood friend Carl Sanders, Barnard was a go-to man on banking and finance for congressional members of both parties; he was part of Gov. Sanders’ intercession with President Kennedy to save Fort Gordon during a round of base closures; and he secured legal clearance for Augusta’s Riverwalk, and financing for projects such as the Walton Way and 15th Street railroad overpasses that blocked ambulances from getting to downtown hospitals, and the St. Sebastian Way extension. He joked self-deprecatingly about its proximity to the water treatment plant, but for travelers arriving at Bush Field, one of the first names they see is Doug Barnard Jr. Parkway. That’s how highly his peers thought of him - though, in truth, he had few peers. If only today’s Congress had more Doug Barnards. How much better off would we be? “One never heard any criticism of Doug’s performance in Congress,” Hudson said. “There was no greater booster of Augusta and other counties that were in his district. His constituent service was exceptional. Politically, Doug was one of a dying breed - a conservative Democrat. That meant that he was fiscally conservative, pro-defense, and yet receptive to programs to benefit children and citizens who could not help themselves.” “When you examine his career,” Craig said, “what becomes clear is that he considered the day he was elected as the commencement of a mission, and he attacked that mission, full throttle every day of his life. That personal philosophy is entirely foreign to many, many Americans who cannot see the inconsistency between his selfless service and their wasteful immersion into the nonsense that is social media and all forms of electronic entertainment, including broadcast media.” This was a man, a statesman and a life to emulate. Online: http://chronicle.augusta.com/ ___ Jan. 16 The Brunswick News on flu season: Allow us to offer a bit of advice: Get a flu shot. We mean before you get the flu. The shot won’t do much for you after you contract the nasty sickness that is running rampant across the country right now. The Centers for Disease Control use an online color-coded map to show the prevalence of the flu in each state and U.S. territory. Guam, Hawaii and the District of Columbia are colored to indicate there has been localized flu activity. The U.S. Virgin Islands indicates sporadic activity. Puerto Rico, understandably so, has not reported as it continues its grueling recovery from hurricanes. The rest of the United States, including Alaska, is covered with the color indicating widespread cases of the flu. It is why officials are calling this one a flu season to remember. The CDC also puts the proportion of people seeing doctors for the flu has already hit 5.8 percent, which is equal to the peak of the worst flu seasons, which typically run from November to March. The rate at which Americans are going into the hospital for the flu is up to nearly 23 people per every 100,000. Four people in Georgia have died from the flu this year and more than 300 have been hospitalized. Locally, the numbers offer some more insight into how bad things are getting. From Oct. 1 to Monday, Southeast Georgia Health System had seen 414 cases. It saw 36 cases during the same period a year ago. Camden County is not faring much better. There have been 144 cases reported this year as compared to 42 cases the year prior in our neighboring county to the south. The message is clear - if you have not already, go get vaccinated for the flu. Reports are out there that the H3N2 strain dominating flu infections during this seasonal outbreak can evade things like vaccinations. That is no reason to skip the flu shot. Besides, if you get a shot and still get the flu, you were probably going to get the flu regardless, so what is the downside to getting vaccinated, considering it just might work? Doctors and health officials are certainly not backing down from the directive to get a flu shot. They know that flu shots are about more than just protection for yourself. They say doing so can also help to stem the spread of the nasty disease. “Every individual over the age of six months should get a flu vaccine - not just for their own protection, but to protect others around them who may be more vulnerable to the flu and its complications,” J. Patrick O’Neal, state Department of Public Health commissioner said in a release last week. If you think you have contracted the flu, go see your doctor or an immediate care facility. To prevent its spread, cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing, wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face, because flu germs can enter the body through mucus membranes in the nose, mouth and eyes.

1536\Technology\DETROIT (AP) — Uber’s autonomous-vehicle chief says the service will carry passengers without human backup drivers in about the same time frame as competitors, which are expecting to be on the road at the latest sometime next year. Advanced Technology Group leader Eric Meyhofer wouldn’t give a specific start date but says the ride-hailing company won’t deploy the vehicles without human backups unless they are proved safe. Waymo, Google’s autonomous car arm, is testing vehicles on public roads in the Phoenix area without human backups and plans to carry passengers soon. General Motors’ Cruise Automation has promised to start sometime next year. Meyhofer says Volvo XC-90 SUVs are being prepared for the work. He says Uber has 215 test vehicles carrying passengers with human backups in Phoenix, San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Toronto. \0.12781672179698944,-0.5165365934371948,-0.14775104820728302,-0.24322356283664703,0.18283717334270477,0.208083838224411,0.6521291136741638,-0.056734323501586914,-0.5597699880599976,-0.35623475909233093,0.16988995671272278,-0.11280031502246857,0.18516258895397186,0.18631526827812195,-0.1831732839345932,-0.30776965618133545,-0.3384445607662201,-0.09444383531808853,0.07374066859483719,0.4549753963947296,0.5510501861572266,0.11670083552598953,0.0719802975654602,-0.32455354928970337,-0.48408743739128113,0.1338559240102768,0.03440113738179207,-0.1415252983570099,0.2380843460559845,-0.05154312774538994,0.006264697760343552,0.29794713854789734,-0.29156923294067383,-0.6154457330703735,-0.08368173241615295,-0.058297380805015564,0.03580242767930031,-0.08050373941659927,-0.10994157195091248,-0.22544479370117188,0.20732858777046204,-0.4366852045059204,0.210855171084404,0.05799255892634392,0.08404070883989334,-0.17990627884864807,0.5192201137542725,0.2584325671195984,-0.45783939957618713,-0.019925758242607117,0.157579705119133,-0.01794145628809929,-0.19188597798347473,-0.32104790210723877,0.4240488111972809,0.025592979043722153,-0.4250168204307556,0.37407436966896057,-0.24744196236133575,0.07594087719917297,0.435329407453537,0.263431578874588,-0.007076640613377094,0.10111863911151886,-0.5531163811683655,0.18507471680641174,0.08546812832355499,0.5867837071418762,-0.7146656513214111,0.8077167868614197,0.16106009483337402,-0.10864677280187607,-0.10954522341489792,0.36271044611930847,0.17382289469242096,0.09277556091547012,-0.3715915083885193,0.3153390884399414,-0.749801754951477,-0.0856630951166153,0.1375986486673355,0.06613392382860184,-0.4056914746761322,1.2999982833862305,-0.11755520850419998,-0.09955514222383499,0.40730637311935425,0.32651346921920776,0.25120633840560913,0.03828645125031471,-0.12005151808261871,0.3823951780796051,-0.1296834945678711,0.26044732332229614,-0.250920832157135,-0.30774039030075073,-0.20832784473896027,-0.023054176941514015,-0.40951037406921387,-0.1360214203596115\WASHINGTONTIMES\Uber close to scrapping human backups in self-driving cars\2018-01-17 23:03:19.0\
1537\Technology\OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - A Republican lawmaker’s discovery of a magnetic box containing a high-tech tracking device affixed to the bottom of his truck is being investigated by Oklahoma officials, who also revealed that four other GOP legislators have reported concerns they were being followed. The mysterious discovery has stunned Oklahoma’s political class, and raised questions about who would spy on lawmakers. “This is outrageous behavior and very reckless and foolish, and it could lead to somebody getting hurt,” Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater said Wednesday, adding that the tactics could lead to felony stalking charges. “They (Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation) are investigating it, and I’m going to be very aggressive in the prosecution of these matters if in fact they have the evidence to prove the case.” Rep. Mark McBride said he discovered the device on his truck on Dec. 4 and reported it to local police, who forwarded the investigation to the state agency, which has jurisdiction over threats against public officials. McBride initially told police he suspected someone connected to the wind industry may be responsible. A longtime supporter of oil and gas and a frequent critic of the wind industry, McBride told a Moore police officer he was writing legislation that could negatively affect Oklahoma wind farms. “It’s very unsettling,” said McBride, who also has filed a lawsuit seeking to identify whoever is responsible for placing the device on his truck. “I stopped hanging out with some of my friends and narrowed down what I did.” Telephone and email messages left Wednesday with Oklahoma Wind Coalition officials were not immediately returned. Prater says four other GOP legislators approached him last year with concerns that they were being followed, but no charges were filed in connection with those reports. Prater said whether a case rises to the level of criminal charges depends on a number of factors, including why someone is tracking or following a legislator. “When you’re talking about lobbyists and certain industries that potentially may have the opportunity to experience a windfall or lose a lot of money based on legislation, money drives a lot of activity, good and bad, and that’s what’s going on here,” Prater said. “When people see that their business or livelihood may be helped or hurt by some certain legislation there, they potentially have the motivation to do something a bit nefarious.” In 2014, Prater pursued criminal charges of blackmail and computer crimes against a tea party activist who sent an intimidating email to a state senator. The activist was found guilty and fined, but the conviction was later thrown out on appeal. “We know this kind of thing occurs a lot more than it is ever reported to us,” Prater said. ___ Follow Sean Murphy at www.twitter.com/apseanmurphy \0.17518509924411774,0.15003158152103424,-0.26676368713378906,-0.05108189210295677,0.5957818031311035,1.0243421792984009,-0.2577441334724426,0.3366250693798065,-1.4008275270462036,-0.6448861956596375,-0.08441878855228424,-0.1658763736486435,-0.5482949018478394,0.102323979139328,-0.34380394220352173,-0.1414354145526886,0.19007280468940735,0.565615177154541,-0.6973816156387329,-0.12272065877914429,0.3663422763347626,-0.02562730386853218,0.07364046573638916,-0.3647238612174988,-0.3916260898113251,0.5480054616928101,-0.0946044996380806,-0.1613209992647171,-0.8159711956977844,-0.08175485581159592,0.033099401742219925,0.9475284218788147,-0.13848544657230377,-0.4635067582130432,0.6033508777618408,-0.026277875527739525,-0.3131423592567444,-0.9606501460075378,0.3846840560436249,-0.3865894675254822,-0.3828275501728058,-0.2223733812570572,1.9754666090011597,-0.49141719937324524,-0.7531778812408447,0.5103514790534973,0.5616100430488586,-0.7778897881507874,-1.6357243061065674,-0.9984845519065857,0.1518438756465912,-0.6174817681312561,-0.39569616317749023,0.4741009771823883,0.8294453024864197,-0.3720368444919586,1.195052981376648,-0.28723853826522827,-1.313797950744629,1.2496817111968994,0.03788455203175545,-0.32773828506469727,0.03928680345416069,-0.010279504582285881,-0.39062508940696716,1.5079591274261475,0.9381303787231445,1.1871341466903687,-0.5254793763160706,-0.1390291005373001,0.9010490775108337,-0.49889689683914185,0.09473021328449249,0.17642094194889069,0.0012660024221986532,-0.7665368914604187,0.2099776417016983,0.8551438450813293,-0.9459072351455688,-0.19674435257911682,0.025296425446867943,0.6603345274925232,-1.5552542209625244,0.672326385974884,0.355668306350708,0.2889223098754883,0.40002158284187317,0.2873631417751312,0.374269038438797,-0.005356100387871265,0.4046385884284973,0.9473349452018738,-0.4237366020679474,0.23828494548797607,0.6782214641571045,-0.5996893644332886,-0.10048196464776993,-0.9352052807807922,-1.4574352502822876,0.5550588369369507\WASHINGTONTIMES\Oklahoma politicians stunned by discovery of possible spying\2018-01-17 22:51:24.0\
1538\Technology\OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - A Washington state Senate panel has approved a bill that would ban trigger devices that allow semi-automatic rifles to fire more rapidly, similar to the ones used in the Las Vegas mass shooting. The Spokesman-Review reports the Law and Justice Committee approved the bill after rejecting a Republican bid to allow them to be sold if the purchaser passes a federal firearms background check. The devices are known as bump stocks or bump-fire stocks. They were used to increase the firing rate of some rifles used by shooter Stephen Paddock last year in Las Vegas. Washington Republican Sen. Mike Padden says the Las Vegas shooting was “horrific,” but preventing future events might be better addressed through improved mental health programs. The devices were originally designed to help shooters with disabilities. ___ Information from: The Spokesman-Review, http://www.spokesman.com \0.12418145686388016,-0.006170669104903936,0.1074664294719696,-0.30546796321868896,-0.15034306049346924,-0.21378494799137115,0.059625979512929916,-0.06269465386867523,-0.4577575623989105,-0.1646365076303482,0.16819946467876434,0.7525571584701538,-0.10598501563072205,-0.05027785897254944,-0.1567549705505371,0.2212928831577301,-0.10168436169624329,-0.06912560015916824,0.05688466131687164,-0.1952436864376068,-0.1216777116060257,0.17350386083126068,-0.5213085412979126,-0.008276390843093395,-0.6129438877105713,0.011677328497171402,0.38316047191619873,0.1030428409576416,0.13115794956684113,-0.11034099757671356,0.32796046137809753,-0.5472132563591003,-0.4738486409187317,-0.4837385416030884,0.7196077704429626,-0.2764416038990021,-0.07054339349269867,-0.33156678080558777,0.08119496703147888,-0.12275911122560501,0.11174257099628448,0.00881883967667818,-0.15473297238349915,0.09029853343963623,-0.1488516926765442,-0.15275102853775024,-0.07686495780944824,0.4098784029483795,-0.7204933762550354,0.0023846097756177187,0.3146919012069702,0.11108875274658203,0.3676971197128296,-0.051364414393901825,0.11783467233181,-0.5973658561706543,0.08942535519599915,-0.5247746706008911,-0.4429050087928772,0.2765467166900635,-0.3248271048069,0.5261887311935425,0.37229424715042114,0.1985333114862442,-0.06729291379451752,-0.18633899092674255,0.38333848118782043,0.6706854104995728,-0.5355485081672668,0.38503700494766235,0.21973653137683868,-0.21656286716461182,-0.4010659456253052,0.09550632536411285,0.2655375003814697,0.09092551469802856,0.5722166895866394,0.48884522914886475,-0.1978410929441452,-0.21664191782474518,0.44561144709587097,0.20177143812179565,-0.08344796299934387,0.15683649480342865,0.30095016956329346,0.2892981171607971,-0.03493938967585564,-0.10067572444677353,0.3469177186489105,0.20138917863368988,-0.7686658501625061,0.3641524314880371,-0.14766335487365723,-0.40099048614501953,-0.07045288383960724,0.49643105268478394,0.03749682009220123,-0.25802478194236755,-0.06748507171869278,0.07833609730005264\WASHINGTONTIMES\Bump stock ban passes Washington state legislative committee\2018-01-17 21:48:08.0\
1539\Technology\COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Federal prisons officials on Wednesday tested a jamming technology inside the walls of a federal prison, a rare move that authorities said they hope will help combat the danger posed by inmates with cellphones. The test was conducted over several hours Wednesday morning at a federal prison in Cumberland, Maryland, Assistant Attorney General Beth Williams told The Associated Press as the testing took place. Williams didn’t give specifics of how the test worked but said it marks a step in the fight to cut down on inmates’ ability to communicate unsupervised and carry on with criminal efforts. Similar tests occurred in 2010, but Williams said Wednesday’s effort was significant because jamming technology has evolved, as have inmates’ efforts to smuggle in the devices. Such tests, she said, could lead to the broader use of technologies like jamming inside prisons to immobilize inmate phones, which officials across the country have described as their No. 1 security threat. “Today is a big step, and the reason really is that, as criminals increase their capacity to commit crimes behind bars, we have to increase our capacity to stop them,” Williams told AP. The renewed interest in jamming within federal facilities follows an announcement by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who told a national meeting of corrections officials that federal prisons would start testing the technology anew. “That is a major safety issue,” he said in his speech. “Cellphones are used to run criminal enterprises, facilitate the commission of violent crimes and thwart law enforcement.” The federal Bureau of Prisons, which houses 185,000 inmates, confiscated over 5,000 cellphones from inmates in 2016, Williams said, and preliminary figures show that number rose last year. For years, officials in state and federal prisons have spoken out about the dangers posed by cellphones in the hands of inmates, who can use them to continue their criminal endeavors behind bars, including drug trafficking, extortion scams, and even hits on witnesses and others. Last year, South Carolina Corrections Director Bryan Stirling testified at an Federal Communications Commission hearing in Washington alongside Robert Johnson, a former South Carolina corrections officer who was nearly killed in 2010 in a hit orchestrated by an inmate using an illegal phone. In July, an inmate was able to escape from a maximum-security prison in South Carolina, thanks in part to a smuggled cellphone. Jimmy Causey was recaptured three days later in Texas. A decades-old law says federal officials can grant permission to jam the public airwaves only to federal agencies, not state or local agencies. Telecommunications companies are opposed, saying jamming cell signals could set a bad precedent and interfere with legal cell users nearby. Stirling, an outspoken advocate for some sort of technology to combat phones within prisons, wrote in June to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, beseeching the top prosecutor for help pursuing FCC permission to jam cell signals of the phones, which are thrown over fences, smuggled by rogue employees and even delivered by drone. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster also lobbied, writing Sessions an August memo on the dangers of prison cellphones and thanking him for any help he could provide. That month, Williams also weighed in, writing in a letter to FCC officials that addressing the security threat posed by contraband cellphones “should be a chief priority” of both the Commission and Justice. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has signaled willingness to work on the issue, telling members of Congress he would put together a working group to address “the proliferation of contraband wireless devices in prisons and the potentially devastating implications for public safety.” Williams said Justice, which oversees the Bureau of Prisons, was optimistic Pai and others at the FCC grasp the need for a way to fight the use of illegal cellphones. “It’s my understanding that Chairman Pai really understands the threat here,” Williams told AP. “We need to do everything possible to prevent the threat from these phones being used.” Stirling applauded Wednesday’s test, saying he and other state-level officials needed the ability to use similar technology in their institutions. “South Carolina state prisons and local jails should be allowed to use the same tools to promote public safety as the federal government,” he said in a statement to AP. “We look forward to continued efforts to end this threat.” ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP.

1540\Technology\RENO, Nev. (AP) - Apple CEO Tim Cook joined Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval and Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve at a groundbreaking ceremony for a new $4 million warehouse in downtown Reno Wednesday as the company announced plans to invest $350 billion in the U.S. economy over the next five years. Sandoval, Schieve and others praised the move and Apple’s earlier commitment to double the size of its existing $1 billion data center east of Reno as important milestones in Nevada’s economic recovery from being one of the states hardest hit by the recession seven years ago. “We are pleased to be part of transforming downtown Reno to the vibrant city it should be,’” Cook said at the ceremony for the shipping and receiving facility a few blocks east of the downtown casino district. “‘Our commitment to Reno and northern Nevada is representative of the commitments we’ve made throughout the U.S.” Cook said the company’s five-year U.S. plan will generate 20,000 new Apple jobs and include more than $10 billion for projects like the Apple data center in Washoe County along U.S. Interstate 80 east of Reno and Sparks. Apple announced plans for the downtown warehouse last May at the same time it announced plans for a $1 billion expansion of that data center, which will include 100 permanent workers, doubling its workforce. About 300 temporary construction jobs also will be created, the company said. The 5-year-old $1 billion data center is located in the Reno Technology Center along U.S. Interstate 80. It’s between Reno and the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center where Tesla’s giant battery factory is based about 15 miles (24 kilometers) east of Reno-Sparks. The warehouse will be used to ship equipment to the expanding facility. Apple was awarded $89 million in state property and sales tax abatements when it committed to the data center in 2012. Building a facility in downtown Reno was necessary for it to fully realize all the potential tax breaks. Sandoval said earlier that the data center was the first major economic development success in northern Nevada and “helped place this region on the technology and innovation map.” Since that time, Nevada has added nearly 250,000 jobs statewide, the governor said Wednesday. Sandoval said he told Cook - whose appearance was kept secret until about 90 minutes before the event - that “it’s like someone coming from Mount Olympus to Reno for a day.” Steve Hill, director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, said Nevada’s economy was “really the worst in the U.S.” seven years ago, when it led the nation in unemployment, foreclosures and bankruptcies. It now is among the fastest-growing states in terms of job growth and wages. “Apple’s decision in 2012 to invest in Nevada, to locate their data center here really marked the turning point and was the catalyst for moving this region and frankly the entire state forward,” Hill said. \0.1996256411075592,-0.406112402677536,-0.3833818733692169,0.4478341042995453,0.1957612782716751,0.5281450748443604,0.5662743449211121,0.05260853469371796,-0.5712258815765381,-0.42944997549057007,-0.7479603290557861,0.5719017386436462,-0.024918824434280396,-0.277037650346756,-1.2380539178848267,0.15962989628314972,-0.4082677364349365,-0.19986039400100708,-0.3836023509502411,-0.14314790070056915,-0.028199508786201477,0.3460579812526703,0.31799188256263733,-1.2767353057861328,-0.27434298396110535,-0.18990987539291382,0.8045679330825806,0.05999404937028885,-0.5128976106643677,0.07366714626550674,-1.9047069549560547,0.897274374961853,-0.1226600632071495,-0.07689657062292099,0.19539271295070648,0.06464947760105133,-0.5359090566635132,-1.0023728609085083,0.8605198860168457,-0.10080847144126892,-0.359194815158844,0.8354547619819641,0.16642872989177704,-0.05264681577682495,0.5826330780982971,-1.1843202114105225,0.7889397740364075,0.7374539375305176,0.09358243644237518,0.047176115214824677,0.7189472913742065,-0.09545637667179108,1.1052902936935425,-0.7769694924354553,0.1740064173936844,-0.5115765929222107,0.7585119009017944,0.2600935399532318,-0.5547893047332764,1.3227918148040771,0.9098089337348938,-1.2893089056015015,-0.4215751886367798,-0.06532792747020721,-0.5462649464607239,-0.5849884748458862,0.8060631155967712,1.5899559259414673,0.04766850546002388,0.5464669466018677,1.124096393585205,1.2854493856430054,-0.28657159209251404,0.1837383210659027,-0.07344592362642288,0.28738656640052795,-1.2060164213180542,-0.7253978252410889,0.9380975365638733,-0.5097499489784241,0.2514944076538086,0.18928511440753937,-0.5276063084602356,0.9612533450126648,-0.048806674778461456,-0.53447026014328,0.06994733214378357,0.13119207322597504,1.010948896408081,-0.7712072730064392,0.14730289578437805,0.9317227602005005,-0.45297276973724365,0.44192034006118774,0.49001190066337585,0.12950311601161957,0.4155774414539337,-0.22165721654891968,-1.1599828004837036,-0.25444406270980835\WASHINGTONTIMES\Apple CEO goes to Reno for groundbreaking of warehouse\2018-01-17 20:40:36.0\
1541\Technology\NEW YORK (AP) - Yahoo users will be able to stream eight basketball games for free under a new deal with the NBA. Verizon, which owns Yahoo, is hoping to use sports to build a digital ad business to rival Facebook and Google. The company now lets anyone watch NFL games on a mobile Yahoo app; before games were limited to Verizon customers. Other major tech companies including Facebook and Amazon are also bidding for sports streaming rights.

1542\Technology\SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is planning to build another corporate campus and hire 20,000 workers during the next five years as part of a $350 billion commitment to the U.S. economy. The pledge announced Wednesday is an offshoot from the sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code championed by President Donald Trump and approved by Congress last month. Besides dramatically lowering the standard corporate tax rate, the reforms offer a one-time break on cash being held overseas. Apple plans to take advantage of that provision to bring back more than $250 billion in offshore cash, generating a tax bill of roughly $38 billion. The Cupertino, California, company says it will announce the location of a second campus devoted to customer support later this year. \-0.4501595199108124,0.13983535766601562,-0.4106093645095825,0.16739191114902496,0.5247623920440674,-0.21259111166000366,0.11145593971014023,0.07403116673231125,-0.33904382586479187,0.09228790551424026,-0.09238051623106003,0.5313108563423157,-0.03599165752530098,-0.010889885015785694,-0.18050725758075714,0.0759250596165657,-0.07260464876890182,-0.2064628154039383,-0.06494596600532532,-0.19435475766658783,-0.37641391158103943,-0.10007506608963013,-0.1115364283323288,-0.598007082939148,-0.48502856492996216,0.3189840614795685,-0.20385043323040009,0.3136540353298187,-0.30266398191452026,-0.17957942187786102,-0.4188016653060913,-0.15225890278816223,-0.19101744890213013,-0.2622814178466797,0.5956853628158569,0.29932278394699097,-0.0752234011888504,-0.6024258732795715,0.3829842507839203,0.2231612354516983,0.35586389899253845,0.318089097738266,-0.509696364402771,-0.16904780268669128,-0.20241044461727142,-0.07550658285617828,-0.6555153131484985,0.5693065524101257,0.34746885299682617,-0.20327243208885193,0.9202481508255005,-0.06535102427005768,-0.2148241549730301,0.3308280408382416,-0.2926981449127197,-0.05095352977514267,-0.25304150581359863,0.08981392532587051,-0.6590834259986877,0.5153913497924805,0.0194107498973608,-0.3371090590953827,-0.2990894019603729,0.3608410060405731,-0.5131658911705017,-0.2527206540107727,-0.34203001856803894,0.14121077954769135,-0.2992197573184967,-0.008732786402106285,-0.03878357633948326,-0.34742993116378784,-0.3217308223247528,-0.29432371258735657,-0.3786171078681946,-0.2541247308254242,-0.744660496711731,0.030042655766010284,0.3214980363845825,-0.16534101963043213,0.10152659565210342,-0.20748554170131683,0.04846211522817612,-0.06782959401607513,-0.03571779280900955,0.11870062351226807,-0.5781669616699219,-0.18157806992530823,-0.2939530909061432,0.12213151156902313,-0.27955618500709534,0.7087087035179138,-0.08706692606210709,0.058438096195459366,-0.23613429069519043,-0.0035086346324533224,0.0493488684296608,0.28501108288764954,0.12265405058860779,-0.6517226696014404\WASHINGTONTIMES\Apple to build 2nd campus, hire 20,000 in $350B pledge\2018-01-17 19:33:41.0\

1544\Technology\MILWAUKEE (AP) - Wisconsin will spend $20 million on a job training program with colleges and universities designed to prepare people for electronics manufacturing jobs. Gov. Scott Walker announced the initiative Wednesday at Milwaukee Area Technical college. Funding for the idea was part of legislation lawmakers approved last year to have Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group build an electronics factory in southeast Wisconsin. But Walker says the initiative isn’t just for Foxconn-related jobs, but for technology careers across the state. Part of the plan will allow high-school students to take college courses in technology before they graduate. There will also be scholarships for students who want to improve their skill set, as well was training for high-demand fields.

1545\Politics\MADISON, Wis. (AP) - The embattled leaders of the Wisconsin agencies that run elections and enforce ethics laws are engaging in a public relations campaign to save their jobs, with a torrent of tweets and personal letters to lawmakers replete with examples designed to show off their nonpartisan stripes. The Republican-controlled Senate plans a Tuesday vote to reject their confirmations, a move Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald says will force them out of their jobs. Ethics Commission administrator Brian Bell sent senators a packet of information Wednesday to defend himself, including a letter excoriating the disbanded Government Accountability Board as too partisan. Elections Commission administrator Michael Haas has been tweeting reasons he should keep the job, including a video from 2011 of him confronting protesters at the old GAB office. \0.024584852159023285,0.3747153580188751,-0.10136165469884872,-0.385415256023407,0.6465698480606079,-0.09471672773361206,0.7684189677238464,-0.238826185464859,-0.11827277392148972,0.14587967097759247,0.09596400707960129,0.24779756367206573,0.122250035405159,-0.12086722254753113,-0.08468113839626312,-0.29474470019340515,-0.40182244777679443,-0.5167186856269836,-0.3596383035182953,-0.3696022629737854,-0.3412955701351166,-0.1541532427072525,0.3823370933532715,0.11127512902021408,-0.15111030638217926,0.2783075273036957,-0.34299397468566895,0.26376283168792725,0.10107821226119995,-0.16746217012405396,-0.26524409651756287,-0.843819797039032,-0.3349512219429016,-0.17766547203063965,6.060490268282592E-4,-0.4474755525588989,-0.05081021040678024,-0.3607901930809021,0.16298145055770874,-0.5700712203979492,-0.720200777053833,-0.3804112672805786,0.010443839244544506,0.12460701912641525,0.16126058995723724,-0.07262838631868362,-0.10464954376220703,0.39480718970298767,-0.32397618889808655,-0.2571452260017395,-0.19329425692558289,-0.21896499395370483,0.052624184638261795,-0.0060046580620110035,0.5647780895233154,-0.36492109298706055,-0.18970167636871338,-0.7101994752883911,-0.3447803556919098,0.5019637942314148,-0.4913015067577362,-0.48119157552719116,0.81669020652771,-0.2448132038116455,-0.36083903908729553,-0.5426126718521118,0.3716091811656952,0.46881604194641113,-0.6409019231796265,0.06058522313833237,-0.3728606104850769,0.017708655446767807,-0.08533498644828796,0.322964072227478,-0.21371693909168243,0.420098215341568,0.333753377199173,0.4666740894317627,0.003666849574074149,-0.14337219297885895,0.11042395979166031,-0.37992221117019653,-0.24882417917251587,-0.3809014558792114,0.28944480419158936,0.3540951907634735,0.08445693552494049,-0.18028904497623444,0.010810828767716885,-0.34717705845832825,-0.11231769621372223,0.46296486258506775,-0.5933723449707031,-0.5489403605461121,0.25397756695747375,0.2513388693332672,-0.07017330825328827,-0.33663782477378845,-0.800218939781189,0.014563043601810932\WASHINGTONTIMES\Wisconsin ethics, elections heads battle for their jobs\2018-01-18 15:33:25.0\
1546\Politics\President Trump took a shot Thursday at the Republican’s stopgap spending bill to keep the government open, saying it shouldn’t include funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program. “CHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension!” the president tweeted. House Republicans included funding for the popular low-cost health program for children to put more pressure on Democrats to back the bill ahead of a shutdown deadline Friday. Mr. Trump has called for a “clean” spending bill that keeps the government open for several weeks while lawmakers negotiate a full-year budget and a fix to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA program that provides temporary deportation amnesty for “Dreamers.” Democrats are withholding support for the stopgap spending bill because they want an immediate deal for the Dreamers, illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. The president also blasted Democrats for tempting a shutdown. “A government shutdown will be devastating to our military…something the Dems care very little about!” he tweeted. \-0.2252444475889206,0.1879415661096573,-0.569959282875061,0.031737178564071655,1.092676043510437,-1.059229850769043,0.8293338418006897,-0.03518764302134514,-0.741730809211731,-0.7791488766670227,0.9165567755699158,0.7033563852310181,-0.5783567428588867,0.5705525875091553,0.09441360831260681,-0.46512705087661743,-0.187130868434906,0.0033943543676286936,0.3029721677303314,-0.5608562231063843,0.6694790720939636,0.18301017582416534,0.4727521240711212,-0.6375671625137329,-0.07782815396785736,0.6404699087142944,0.16748453676700592,0.5970816016197205,-0.5948017239570618,-0.3059653341770172,-0.8975792527198792,0.017121830955147743,0.9390687942504883,-0.07978171110153198,0.062321048229932785,0.8157594203948975,0.21606147289276123,0.3318348228931427,-0.25103047490119934,-0.875328540802002,-0.09829198569059372,0.5025182962417603,-0.22111931443214417,-0.44685229659080505,-1.4812490940093994,0.4006011188030243,-0.33959895372390747,0.6563125848770142,0.8999008536338806,0.3080873191356659,0.2625226080417633,0.03776957094669342,0.14397840201854706,0.09536372870206833,-0.07241176813840866,0.062416382133960724,0.02115618996322155,-0.3944094181060791,-0.9021950364112854,0.04448183625936508,-0.5134410262107849,0.45767495036125183,0.5335206985473633,0.22388102114200592,-0.7877899408340454,-0.017282232642173767,-0.0377521850168705,0.1330147236585617,-0.6975670456886292,0.30970627069473267,0.5796133875846863,-0.27377745509147644,-0.4367908835411072,-0.24215570092201233,-0.9446837306022644,-0.5407633781433105,0.21777820587158203,0.7110647559165955,-0.17935945093631744,-0.11165234446525574,-0.4931076169013977,0.46858343482017517,0.189728781580925,0.19638366997241974,0.6249337196350098,0.8093464970588684,-0.09107209742069244,0.1220206767320633,-0.5062733888626099,-0.18175053596496582,-0.5347276329994202,-0.49090710282325745,-0.0038728099316358566,0.25445887446403503,-0.14280617237091064,-0.11471972614526749,0.07863137125968933,-0.5569835901260376,-0.6805192828178406,0.47927024960517883\WASHINGTONTIMES\Donald Trump muscles in on GOP strategy to stop shutdown\2018-01-18 15:21:33.0\1515, 1546, 1549, 1636, 1637, 1654
1547\Politics\House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Thursday that the Pentagon needs a long-term budget for military readiness. “We have simply pushed our military passed the breaking point,” Mr. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said at a Center for Strategic and International Studies event. “The Pentagon cannot plan for the future if it keeps operating under these short-term spending bills,” he added. Mr. Ryan said Democrats need to “stop playing politics” with defense spending and give the military what they need to remain “the best in the world.” Republicans cannot pass a budget without Democratic support in the Senate. A 60-vote threshold is needed to pass a budget. They also need those votes to raise the budget caps on military spending. “When it comes to keeping Americans safe, we’re all on the same side,” Mr. Ryan said. \-0.18626339733600616,-0.1688186675310135,-0.573551595211029,0.22241255640983582,0.04343358799815178,-0.1151050478219986,0.7928160429000854,0.3658714294433594,-0.3238796889781952,-0.3679562509059906,0.7497046589851379,0.8200426697731018,-0.3249015510082245,0.32726284861564636,0.09112551063299179,-0.44112715125083923,0.10087290406227112,0.3442959487438202,-0.2832350432872772,0.15969227254390717,-0.20258182287216187,0.18405373394489288,0.00985994003713131,-0.4397047758102417,-0.5730054378509521,0.6518520712852478,0.024121131747961044,0.4513433575630188,-0.13521622121334076,0.18472591042518616,-0.6700394749641418,0.08548208326101303,-0.07960754632949829,-0.6670045256614685,0.7038052082061768,0.07043252140283585,0.15751582384109497,-0.5443546175956726,0.19600605964660645,-0.24793480336666107,-0.31227347254753113,-0.15144574642181396,-0.12882018089294434,-0.21503718197345734,-0.7019261717796326,-0.38505181670188904,-0.5402934551239014,1.0554711818695068,0.9406410455703735,0.06261042505502701,0.4765147268772125,-0.16260674595832825,-0.22629587352275848,0.18424081802368164,-0.17844262719154358,-0.2818390727043152,-0.10212691128253937,0.2897275686264038,-0.5032030344009399,0.0784858912229538,-0.18266870081424713,0.604144275188446,-0.13081766664981842,0.33967891335487366,-0.21804310381412506,0.07125046849250793,-0.1750124841928482,0.09478054940700531,-0.46390658617019653,0.36609289050102234,-0.182306170463562,-0.5367130041122437,-0.13227154314517975,0.17321990430355072,-0.06992208957672119,0.238249272108078,-0.1738765984773636,-0.08580157160758972,-0.024731580168008804,0.14577369391918182,-0.11609416455030441,-0.1372946798801422,0.014101770706474781,-0.2261451780796051,0.05925973877310753,0.35545286536216736,-0.0624375157058239,-0.6014201045036316,-0.34170010685920715,0.15051725506782532,-0.41222909092903137,0.09153303503990173,0.15819275379180908,0.181559219956398,-0.010290154255926609,0.11597935855388641,-0.44581857323646545,-0.3180650472640991,-0.8181016445159912,0.10139018297195435\WASHINGTONTIMES\Paul Ryan: Pentagon needs a long-term budget for military readiness\2018-01-18 15:18:38.0\
1548\Politics\TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A former assistant prosecutor is puzzled why Gov. Chris Christie commuted the 40-year sentence of a convicted murderer days before the Republican left office. Christie on Friday issued an order that led to the release of 50-year-old Lisa Pyatt from prison on Saturday. She was sentenced to serve at least 30 years in prison in 1993 for stabbing her fiance in the heart three days before their wedding in 1991. Pyatt’s lawyer used a battered woman’s syndrome defense. Former assistant Ocean County prosecutor William Cunningham tells the Asbury Park Press he proved Pyatt was not a victim and had accused a previous boyfriend of domestic violence. Christie’s order did not explain why he commuted the sentence. It said Pyatt had applied and the state Parole Board had investigated. ___ Information from: Asbury Park (N.J.)

1549\Politics\Sen. James Lankford said Thursday that his proposal to limit debate hours for Senate confirmations is gaining support among his colleagues, but that if it doesn’t work the “nuclear option” will likely be used to make the change. “If we can’t get it changed in the right way, then yes we will,” said Mr. Lankford, Oklahoma Republican, on “The Hugh Hewitt Show.” He said the current debate time takes too long to get a nominee through the confirmation process. He said limiting those hours for lower-level nominees would help streamline the process and fill more positions in a timely manner. “These are folks that have already gone through committee, already been approved,” Mr. Lankford said. The proposal would limit debate for district judges to two hours while most other nominees would have an eight-hour limit. The “nuclear option” would allow the Senate to change the rules without passing Mr. Lankford’s measure, but it is not seen as a tactic many Republicans want to use. He said he’s trying to get the votes needed to pass his proposal and avoid using that power. “So far, it has not gained Democratic support,” Mr. Lankford said, but he said many of his colleagues on the other side of the aisle are discussing the measure. He said his goal is to have the votes in place whenever Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decides to allow a vote. “My push is to try and get everything ready,” Mr. Lankford said.  \0.29529982805252075,-0.401479572057724,-0.6616107225418091,-0.14295122027397156,0.6644666194915771,0.7701147794723511,-0.15759189426898956,0.5936083793640137,-0.5133710503578186,-0.4983535408973694,0.10540469735860825,0.7874963283538818,0.2520667612552643,0.1244480162858963,-0.14925459027290344,0.1352829933166504,-0.2797340154647827,0.621816873550415,-0.24149225652217865,0.3188845217227936,0.3235635757446289,-0.27483808994293213,0.49089643359184265,-0.14439542591571808,-0.656872570514679,0.9496667385101318,-0.14752762019634247,0.24887286126613617,-0.07849971950054169,-0.5314055681228638,0.37997522950172424,0.11437095701694489,-0.34979188442230225,-0.07596292346715927,0.3860427141189575,-0.3905262351036072,-0.5640945434570312,0.5476802587509155,0.748496413230896,0.7822877168655396,0.345020055770874,-0.4152505695819855,0.2794806957244873,-5.695458385162055E-4,-0.5117896795272827,0.2500739097595215,-0.1308143138885498,0.868966817855835,-0.18208415806293488,-0.3206217885017395,0.4720032811164856,-0.10377661883831024,0.2749873399734497,-0.174916610121727,0.7214446663856506,-0.2949219048023224,0.5013361573219299,-0.20403523743152618,-0.7434870004653931,0.6780914068222046,-1.0252933502197266,0.6691484451293945,-0.11877300590276718,-0.5509117841720581,-0.78034508228302,0.05918898433446884,-0.4103354513645172,0.9850919842720032,-0.5012878775596619,0.46813052892684937,0.008567113429307938,-0.627002477645874,-0.1481548547744751,0.23285876214504242,-0.669766902923584,-0.5745627880096436,-0.32772889733314514,0.8894296288490295,-0.4838940501213074,-0.49106746912002563,-0.46465325355529785,0.2524586617946625,-0.6171250939369202,0.033172860741615295,0.3374045491218567,0.7803312540054321,0.19386973977088928,-0.10455133020877838,-0.38201263546943665,0.14363184571266174,-0.11661530286073685,0.3597707450389862,-0.8724228143692017,0.1506756991147995,-1.2000728845596313,0.06433418393135071,0.1448427438735962,-0.8108320236206055,-1.1892203092575073,0.10719871520996094\WASHINGTONTIMES\James Lankford: Senate will use 'nuclear option' if his plan to limit debate time isn't passed\2018-01-18 14:48:25.0\1515, 1546, 1549, 1636, 1637, 1654
1550\Politics\A free-market group is urging the White House to rescind an Obama-era payday lending rule that is currently under review, saying the regulation would cause “paperwork proliferation on a massive scale” for lenders. The Competitive Enterprise Institute asked the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to reject the rule because it violates the law. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s rule “violates the Paperwork Reduction Act, a longstanding law aimed at controlling regulatory burdens,” said CEI General Counsel Sam Kazman. The consumer bureau’s new director, White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney, announced this week that the agency will “reconsider” the regulation issued in October, which would have required payday lenders to evaluate whether borrowers can pay back their loans. Mr. Mulvaney, who was picked by President Trump late last year to take the CFPB in a new direction after the resignation of Democrat Richard Cordray, said Wednesday that more changes are coming. “In this new year, and under new leadership, it is natural for the bureau to critically examine its policies and practices to ensure they align with the bureau’s statutory mandate,” Mr. Mulvaney said. “Much can be done to facilitate greater consumer choice and efficient markets, while vigorously enforcing consumer financial law in a way that guarantees due process. I look forward to receiving public comments in response to this call for evidence and encourage all interested parties to participate.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat who advocated for the creation of the CFPB in 2010, blasted the move to review the payday lending rule. “Payday lenders spent $63,000 helping Mick Mulvaney get elected to Congress and now their investment is paying off many times over,” she said. “By scrapping this rule, Mulvaney will allow his campaign donors to continue to generate massive fees peddling some of the most abusive financial products in existence.” \-0.07119153439998627,-0.6090750098228455,0.12999504804611206,-0.15124770998954773,0.41209086775779724,0.052960265427827835,0.5371319055557251,0.9338134527206421,-1.4553251266479492,0.06222759559750557,0.8851451277732849,0.9125028848648071,-0.02971653826534748,0.21701692044734955,-0.3067341148853302,-0.36639243364334106,0.6422385573387146,-0.5243626236915588,-0.042090948671102524,-0.555781900882721,0.04898285120725632,-0.03472330793738365,0.21989494562149048,0.5256347060203552,-0.8913281559944153,1.1091653108596802,0.8529312014579773,-0.27202335000038147,0.38276970386505127,-0.37134280800819397,-0.44243738055229187,0.48083552718162537,0.26445984840393066,-0.4444443881511688,-0.041030608117580414,0.6583204865455627,-0.1749192625284195,-0.3603290021419525,0.9833328723907471,-0.18445858359336853,-0.3916895389556885,-0.3145647644996643,0.07308851182460785,-0.6495431065559387,-0.44790926575660706,-0.6249552965164185,0.23101873695850372,0.2940066456794739,-0.0889536589384079,0.8358187675476074,-0.11303874850273132,-0.7200527787208557,-0.2285376787185669,0.20147277414798737,0.20595592260360718,0.06328315287828445,-0.023676756769418716,-0.4549926221370697,-0.9682613015174866,-0.06720615178346634,-0.5926418304443359,0.33949312567710876,1.1626447439193726,-0.7889569997787476,-0.19378051161766052,-0.07904753088951111,0.8713015913963318,0.9296427369117737,-0.9600078463554382,-0.1066531091928482,0.9098305106163025,-0.1320473551750183,-0.5272298455238342,-0.2112748771905899,-0.46048253774642944,0.6489266753196716,0.11629719287157059,0.7534586787223816,0.05427121743559837,-0.1719145029783249,0.6647937297821045,-0.23268063366413116,-0.2747926115989685,-0.3398532271385193,-0.2624744474887848,0.7148054242134094,-0.37789276242256165,-0.3135124742984772,0.01255793310701847,-0.7003087997436523,-0.17554941773414612,0.022933704778552055,-1.3025537729263306,0.12834957242012024,-0.12499721348285675,-0.2669766843318939,0.23453013598918915,-0.4704478085041046,-0.1804514080286026,-0.12094458937644958\WASHINGTONTIMES\White House urged to kill Obama-era payday lending rule\2018-01-18 14:42:53.0\
1551\Politics\Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said Thursday that the party raised a record amount of money last year in part to gear up for a difficult midterm election. “We raised $132 million in 2017. It is the most any party has ever raised in an off-year getting ready for a midterm election,” Mrs. McDaniel said on CNN. She acknowledged that historically the president’s party loses a significant amount of seats in the midterm elections, which is why fundraising was such a big priority for the party last year. “We’re already in 22 states building out our data and our ground game,” she said. Mrs. McDaniel said the RNC has been building a massive data system to get out as many voters as they can in this year’s midterm elections. She said the system is customized to address each voter’s concern and provide them with as much information as possible. \0.37033188343048096,-0.03885358199477196,-0.13127347826957703,0.07930387556552887,0.186008021235466,-0.2352834790945053,0.2816671133041382,-0.08465074002742767,-0.481875479221344,0.0247652605175972,-0.09498707205057144,0.4133334159851074,0.8984138369560242,0.35271814465522766,-0.8581606149673462,0.46573394536972046,-0.7929547429084778,-0.13679517805576324,0.003358765970915556,-0.42147096991539,0.4843957722187042,-0.2634163498878479,-0.2774513363838196,-0.36242640018463135,-0.17137876152992249,0.5740929245948792,0.037431418895721436,-0.28166744112968445,0.8440946340560913,-0.10263518244028091,-0.15040737390518188,0.15315963327884674,-0.36150792241096497,0.3095532953739166,0.6263027787208557,0.3906129002571106,0.059704847633838654,-0.1541399508714676,0.11445468664169312,-0.7449464201927185,-0.18252016603946686,0.27865567803382874,0.20176763832569122,-0.22862164676189423,0.3559204041957855,0.198782816529274,0.5166845917701721,-0.44343894720077515,0.21249134838581085,-0.16767674684524536,0.8605592846870422,-0.9001920223236084,0.24418148398399353,0.6066934466362,0.40662673115730286,0.5751974582672119,0.344236820936203,0.09529569000005722,-0.39733290672302246,0.5082570910453796,-0.42503654956817627,-0.6987124085426331,-0.4028678238391876,-0.4790417551994324,0.14640335738658905,0.6870748400688171,-0.16146628558635712,0.8314753770828247,0.32214176654815674,0.5811976790428162,0.09754521399736404,0.3895231783390045,0.16770675778388977,0.027434442192316055,-0.07988173514604568,0.03076286055147648,-0.1350218802690506,-0.2802334725856781,-0.37934747338294983,-0.399468332529068,-0.12179836630821228,0.26216691732406616,-0.1465253084897995,0.7319151759147644,-0.18358273804187775,0.2835574448108673,0.14692091941833496,0.7674301266670227,-0.8371221423149109,-0.04845208674669266,-0.2725180685520172,0.3632175028324127,-0.42053043842315674,0.5085354447364807,-0.5951462388038635,0.04483557119965553,0.28594544529914856,-0.17837882041931152,-0.8936188220977783,0.5001142024993896\WASHINGTONTIMES\Ronna Romney McDaniel: RNC raises record $132 million to prepare for tough midterm race\2018-01-18 13:59:59.0\
1552\Politics\Sens. Angus King and Mike Rounds said Thursday that they will not support a continuing resolution and insist on passing a formal budget. “I think we’ve got to close this escape hatch, stop voting for CRs, and tell the leadership they’re going to have to make their deals, and then we’ll get it done,” Mr. King, Maine independent, said on CNN. Mr. Rounds, South Dakota Republican, agreed saying that each time a continuing resolution, or CR, runs out Congress faces the threat of a shutdown. “It’s a matter of defense and it’s a matter of trying to make sure that in the future, we get our work done on time,” he said. Both senators agreed that if Congress comes close to a deal, and wants to pass a CR to keep the government open while lawmakers finalize it, they will support a temporary spending bill. But a long-term deal must be in place first for them to even consider it. They both said the bipartisan deal negotiated between Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Dick Durbin of Illinois is a good starting point for an immigration debate. “We both want to see a good immigration policy put together. The proposal that Lindsey’s been working on with Dick Durbin may not be perfect, but it’s a step in the right direction,” Mr. Rounds said. Mr. King said there’s no reason Congress shouldn’t include at least some of the existing bill in the budget, especially protection for Dreamers, or children brought to the U.S. illegally. “I don’t know what we’re going to know in March that we don’t know now,” he said. President Trump set a deadline of March 5 for the current program to expire. He has pressured Congress to pass a bill that includes protections for these people, but also wants it to include greater border security funding and resources. Lawmakers have argued about whether to include such protections in the spending bill, as Democrats would like, or to deal with the issue separately as many Republicans would like to see. \0.49224135279655457,-0.33266085386276245,0.06598646938800812,-0.31527790427207947,-0.3874630033969879,0.1477559357881546,0.24856574833393097,0.19883932173252106,-0.6343637108802795,0.026485344395041466,1.228187918663025,0.8665675520896912,-0.09669362753629684,0.11447343230247498,-1.0992467403411865,-0.6155839562416077,0.11657160520553589,0.3247441351413727,-0.3613739311695099,0.12442756444215775,0.27782735228538513,-0.036052655428647995,0.8842844367027283,-0.8447609543800354,0.16378924250602722,0.3574812710285187,0.19942091405391693,0.04733569920063019,-0.5363786816596985,0.20587299764156342,-0.384264200925827,0.12561485171318054,0.7074585556983948,-0.3850690722465515,0.27429014444351196,-0.09697174280881882,-0.3262014389038086,-0.7238048315048218,0.17866919934749603,-0.6264877319335938,-0.42153114080429077,0.11464143544435501,0.4585142135620117,-0.23902161419391632,-0.13876207172870636,0.5914217233657837,0.29260459542274475,0.600278377532959,0.8357186317443848,0.5437450408935547,0.40672892332077026,-0.1738567054271698,0.812849760055542,-0.5882540941238403,0.5261759161949158,-0.6416645050048828,-0.22383278608322144,-0.0985657349228859,-0.8531632423400879,0.056153424084186554,-0.42163899540901184,0.19398224353790283,0.262803316116333,0.7327209115028381,-0.7142378687858582,-0.09891101717948914,0.22577746212482452,0.5880141854286194,-1.6850767135620117,0.17769555747509003,0.6233678460121155,-0.2577663064002991,-1.2993465662002563,0.1637379229068756,-0.7966398000717163,0.0020502288825809956,-0.4131946563720703,-0.2572455108165741,-0.05961337685585022,-0.3251954913139343,-0.1338820904493332,-0.15502862632274628,-0.31456437706947327,-1.0661208629608154,0.04774750396609306,0.8230085968971252,0.22497104108333588,-0.5071820020675659,-0.5521054267883301,-1.8542693578638136E-4,-0.08413636684417725,-0.33634626865386963,-0.6600468158721924,0.34118807315826416,-0.28678393363952637,-0.12499532848596573,-0.4129818081855774,-0.255116730928421,-1.1113468408584595,0.4777956008911133\WASHINGTONTIMES\Angus King, Mike Rounds say they will not support CR without long-term budget deal in place\2018-01-18 13:36:25.0\
1553\Politics\Rep. Sean Duffy said Thursday that he’s given his guest ticket for the State of the Union to the Army veteran who asked to take the ticket of those representatives boycotting the speech. Ricky Taylor, who served two tours in Afghanistan, tweeted earlier this week that he would like to attend the speech since he is a Trump supporter. His Twitter handle is “Deplorable Vet,” a play on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s description of some Trump supporters as “a basket of deplorables” during the campaign. “@FoxNews Everyone please help and retweet. I would like to take Maxine Waters seats at The State Of The Union Address. If they don’t want to go this Military Veteran would gladly go. I’d tell the President how much he means to myself, family, Military, and all of his supporters!” Mr. Taylortweeted Monday. Mr. Duffy, Wisconsin Republican, saw the request and decided to give the ticket usually reserved for his wife to Mr. Taylor. The Army veteran said Thursday that he’s happy to attend the speech with Mr. Duffy and never really believed Ms. Waters, California Democrat, would respond to his request. “I don’t think I really fit Maxine’s narrative. I’m a black, Latino veteran, and she wants to portray Donald Trump’s supporters as middle-aged white men that live in trailers and have Confederate flags sticking out,” Mr. Taylor explained in an appearance with Mr. Duffy Thursday on Fox News. “I pretty much knew I wouldn’t get a response,” he added. Mr. Duffy assured that despite the looming threat of a government shutdown, the speech will go on as planned. “We’re still going to have a State of the Union. There’s not going to be a government shutdown,” he said. He added that Republicans in the House are hoping to pass a spending measure Thursday and move the debate over to the Senate to pressure Democrats to act before Friday’s spending deadline. \0.20883335173130035,-0.507571280002594,0.023550180718302727,0.4800780415534973,0.4241235852241516,-0.2420388162136078,0.9592728614807129,-0.25113433599472046,-0.500200092792511,-0.658498227596283,0.12411925941705704,0.6305100917816162,0.22279958426952362,0.47377604246139526,-0.5783109664916992,-0.4946350157260895,-0.014713430777192116,-0.14471650123596191,0.6358153820037842,-0.714139997959137,0.17380334436893463,0.030730757862329483,0.030096108093857765,0.03153449669480324,-0.9183351397514343,0.28985676169395447,0.1123560220003128,0.42510902881622314,-0.6996479630470276,-0.6692118644714355,-0.0010598754743114114,0.3621201813220978,-0.23703409731388092,0.27336522936820984,0.2551783621311188,0.007985958829522133,-0.8590331673622131,-0.6295633316040039,-0.7261378765106201,-0.8403216004371643,-0.4225960671901703,-0.2006765902042389,1.0277281999588013,-0.865726888179779,0.4786374270915985,0.112993985414505,-0.1857111155986786,0.18840087950229645,0.2398458570241928,0.044013772159814835,-0.3139655888080597,-0.9203977584838867,-0.16308708488941193,-0.39562371373176575,0.107554130256176,-0.48375827074050903,-0.5623883008956909,0.04725363105535507,-0.8198398351669312,0.3748474717140198,-0.07030029594898224,-0.6028171181678772,0.3553817868232727,-0.09684194624423981,-0.23568344116210938,0.1688060611486435,0.41260096430778503,0.6117095351219177,-0.10378452390432358,0.9472261071205139,0.5370097756385803,-0.8224695920944214,-1.1509779691696167,0.706114649772644,-1.2210447788238525,-0.5440622568130493,0.2518745958805084,0.7688560485839844,0.5078848004341125,-0.48367971181869507,0.02376454323530197,0.09134328365325928,-0.14855696260929108,0.7913916110992432,-0.3333743214607239,1.0955729484558105,0.20096662640571594,0.4576287567615509,-0.545068621635437,0.3396005928516388,0.02497316710650921,-0.32197052240371704,-0.9598833322525024,-0.050186075270175934,0.2582067549228668,0.07886764407157898,-0.18029385805130005,-0.4549049139022827,-0.7898232936859131,0.08370357006788254\WASHINGTONTIMES\Sean Duffy gives SOTU ticket to veteran who asked to go in place of members boycotting\2018-01-18 12:51:22.0\
1554\Politics\President Trump said Thursday that the idea of the wall on the U.S.-Mexican border has remain unchanged since the campaign. “The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it. Parts will be, of necessity, see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water…..” Mr. Trumptweeted. The tweet comes after White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told lawmakers Wednesday that the president was uninformed about immigration issues when he promised the wall. He told members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that there will never be a wall along the entire border with Mexico and added that Mexico will not pay for whatever parts do have a wall erected, according to a Washington Post report. The president pushed back on that Thursday insisting the wall will be paid for by Mexico. He also mentioned NAFTA — the trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico — which he promised to renegotiate or end entirely during the campaign. He said compared to that agreement, the wall will be “peanuts.” “….The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. The $20 billion dollar Wall is “peanuts” compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke!” Mr. Trumptweeted. \0.1398870199918747,0.8152640461921692,0.004361404571682215,-0.352609246969223,0.3510371148586273,0.1253131777048111,-0.05609419569373131,-0.27343982458114624,-0.1366254985332489,0.32311949133872986,0.41213276982307434,0.58359694480896,-0.0042575327679514885,-0.009253483265638351,-0.12038247287273407,0.8142403364181519,0.13575255870819092,0.2945365011692047,-0.5273212194442749,0.11346088349819183,0.987358570098877,0.04812706634402275,0.011357628740370274,-0.8688096404075623,-0.8010150194168091,0.4710082411766052,0.48390495777130127,-0.6226121783256531,-0.9675523042678833,-0.7668786644935608,-0.43800458312034607,0.9598057270050049,0.2136535942554474,0.5183302760124207,0.2669375538825989,-0.2403763383626938,-0.4115496873855591,-0.28706324100494385,0.12232570350170135,0.12111848592758179,-0.25638705492019653,0.24283646047115326,0.24080288410186768,-0.36114248633384705,0.5026311874389648,-0.7034851908683777,0.6979131698608398,-0.28843334317207336,-0.8098193407058716,0.35244864225387573,0.1440219134092331,0.4547710716724396,0.2334049642086029,0.8979899287223816,0.9339650869369507,-0.2899581491947174,0.4315968155860901,-0.58901447057724,-0.3549617826938629,0.9253557920455933,0.49205368757247925,-0.11618687212467194,-0.1530117392539978,0.3948366045951843,-0.6096769571304321,0.1276140809059143,0.5442708730697632,0.02212158963084221,-0.6187294125556946,0.674669086933136,-0.12451314926147461,0.06736031174659729,-1.247645378112793,0.25979477167129517,-1.0366668701171875,-0.3432324230670929,-0.3675270676612854,0.19756069779396057,-0.4464385509490967,-0.6858510971069336,-0.4456773102283478,-0.3544943332672119,-0.13542823493480682,0.05080224201083183,-0.2107374519109726,0.24366731941699982,0.1729782521724701,-0.12947458028793335,0.3593469262123108,0.3421880602836609,-0.44974368810653687,-0.11345312744379044,0.3983598053455353,-0.17835776507854462,0.9701038599014282,-0.1130363717675209,-0.17596286535263062,-0.4987522065639496,-0.8091573715209961,-0.2024424970149994\WASHINGTONTIMES\Donald Trump insists the border wall will be built as promised\2018-01-18 12:28:19.0\1638, 1554
1555\Politics\LOGAN, W.Va. (AP) - A former coal company CEO who served a one-year prison term on charges related to the deadliest U.S. mine disaster in four decades is kicking off his U.S. Senate campaign with a town hall meeting for voters. Ex-Massey Energy boss Don Blankenship is scheduled to attend the meeting Thursday night at the Chief Logan Lodge, Hotel and Conference Center in Logan. Blankenship has said he wants to tell voters why he’s the best candidate. A news conference is planned afterward. Blankenship will face U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in the GOP primary on May 8. Democrat Joe Manchin is seeking re-election. Blankenship has said President Donald Trump “needs more than just another vote. He needs input as to how West Virginia can improve its citizens’ quality of life.” The 67-year-old was released from a federal prison in California last year. He is currently serving one year of supervised release scheduled to end on May 9 - one day after the primary. Blankenship received approval last August to have his supervised release transferred to federal officials in Nevada, where he has a home in Las Vegas. He was sentenced in 2016 for a misdemeanor conviction of conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards at Massey’s Upper Big Branch Mine in southern West Virginia, where 29 workers died in a 2010 explosion. He was acquitted of felonies that could have stretched his sentence to 30 years. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected Blankenship’s bid to appeal. He has insisted he’s innocent, and that natural gas and not methane gas and excess coal dust caused the explosion. He has blamed Manchin for helping create the public sentiment against him and challenged the senator to a debate. “I know who I am and what I am,” Blankenship said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press in May after leaving prison. “And I’m more than 100 percent innocent, and the charges were ridiculous. And all the emotion and all the publicity about it was just incorrect, which has been the case with me for years and years.” Authorities have long dismissed Blankenship’s argument. Manchin, who was West Virginia’s governor during the time of the mine explosion, has said he hoped Blankenship would “disappear from the public eye” after his prison release. \0.5383756160736084,0.4860590696334839,-0.34684982895851135,0.2626950442790985,0.05397282913327217,-0.5014464855194092,0.45178350806236267,-3.99426236981526E-4,-1.2473899126052856,-0.8042402863502502,0.26152175664901733,0.8380588293075562,0.5976530313491821,0.4187374413013458,-0.6550728678703308,0.41385966539382935,-0.6215137839317322,-0.5941973328590393,-0.47137585282325745,-0.07038187235593796,-0.10111167281866074,-0.9431390166282654,0.20615626871585846,-0.21015584468841553,-0.544034481048584,0.4531884789466858,0.12229346483945847,0.24995890259742737,-0.5371324419975281,-0.5371007919311523,0.11505430936813354,0.14756731688976288,-0.2952005863189697,-0.0705706849694252,-0.007468262687325478,-0.25210726261138916,-0.48443251848220825,-0.21622706949710846,0.22348149120807648,0.3280441164970398,0.40169376134872437,0.018712585791945457,0.5973818898200989,0.7071982026100159,0.8109029531478882,-0.37198778986930847,0.6425016522407532,0.30139750242233276,-1.3136446475982666,-0.8803572654724121,1.664679765701294,-0.9583178758621216,0.3991837799549103,-0.2709576487541199,1.652658224105835,-0.4568551480770111,0.5526904463768005,-0.2587389647960663,-0.22192694246768951,-0.14158126711845398,0.015750832855701447,0.7339379787445068,0.5530065298080444,0.48737773299217224,-0.1982908397912979,0.3481989800930023,0.6760585308074951,0.6774119734764099,-1.5470529794692993,0.8662980198860168,0.006840564776211977,-0.03599775582551956,-0.22826650738716125,0.30192306637763977,-0.9546093344688416,-0.5482576489448547,0.24245117604732513,0.6049017310142517,-0.9427053332328796,0.2495805025100708,0.7283924221992493,0.6180055141448975,-0.30602124333381653,0.8960121273994446,0.4983210265636444,0.8607425689697266,0.8224092721939087,0.5119751691818237,1.380555510520935,-0.20095974206924438,0.534276008605957,0.9359762072563171,-1.3625131845474243,-0.3887006342411041,-0.367797315120697,0.06834426522254944,-0.7500126361846924,-1.200831413269043,-0.6061356663703918,-0.5840674042701721\WASHINGTONTIMES\Convicted ex-coal CEO to start US Senate bid with town hall\2018-01-18 12:26:20.0\
1556\Politics\SAN DIEGO (AP) - A University of California, Berkeley student has been released after nearly three weeks in an immigration facility near the U.S.-Mexico border. His attorney says Luis Mora was released unconditionally from the Otay Mesa Detention Facility on Wednesday. Mora cried when he was released and told San Diego ABC affiliate KGTV that it was the first time he had seen the sun in 18 days. Officials say Mora overstayed his visa while visiting the U.S. from Colombia as a child and is not authorized to be in the country. The 20-year-old was returning from a party with his girlfriend when they took a wrong turn and ended up at a border checkpoint, where he was detained. Mora says he’s grateful he could make his case and stay in the United States. \0.12133986502885818,0.33166977763175964,-0.6942163705825806,-0.16107237339019775,-0.14416421949863434,-0.05334024876356125,0.21680720150470734,-0.10732056200504303,-0.7297567129135132,0.1745055764913559,0.5169200897216797,0.6503489017486572,0.3353314697742462,0.31920430064201355,-0.055286187678575516,-0.014101499691605568,0.001278310315683484,0.05749785155057907,0.8306635618209839,0.22925573587417603,-0.028165165334939957,0.157465860247612,-0.18846097588539124,0.010133536532521248,-0.5915734767913818,0.16505934298038483,0.5324349999427795,0.7517792582511902,-0.3246062994003296,-0.022936902940273285,0.0954216718673706,0.21365149319171906,-0.44243505597114563,-0.13002422451972961,0.4168436527252197,0.21626724302768707,-0.20616857707500458,-0.0265493243932724,-0.6742990612983704,-0.7135924100875854,-0.19519515335559845,0.07813390344381332,0.9031620621681213,-0.28335174918174744,-0.20767712593078613,-0.41263511776924133,0.8298401236534119,0.41997307538986206,-0.5314291715621948,-0.38196486234664917,0.22276213765144348,-0.4143345355987549,-0.07423868030309677,-0.08324560523033142,0.820785641670227,-0.5002469420433044,0.22453048825263977,-0.29553335905075073,0.006053297780454159,0.7434734106063843,0.1469314992427826,-0.4332733452320099,0.09213171899318695,0.1567765474319458,-0.4291248321533203,-0.22906486690044403,0.01851191744208336,0.7130907773971558,-0.12715472280979156,0.3197517991065979,0.40812093019485474,-0.21520379185676575,-0.3758443593978882,0.46246588230133057,-0.2199925184249878,-0.6154083013534546,0.725843608379364,0.5444961190223694,-0.4930962026119232,-0.5752732753753662,0.5180602669715881,0.029562480747699738,-0.8494533896446228,0.31166282296180725,0.4060271978378296,0.023668982088565826,0.3110573887825012,0.5519166588783264,0.0027194591239094734,0.3828548789024353,0.1229613795876503,-0.038223378360271454,-0.452255517244339,-0.4601396322250366,-0.04968952760100365,0.24612541496753693,-0.42899444699287415,0.17399732768535614,-0.43071988224983215,0.0939439982175827\WASHINGTONTIMES\College student in US illegally free after weeks in custody\2018-01-18 07:02:28.0\
1557\Politics\WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House chief of staff says President Donald Trump’s views on immigration are evolving - giving some people hope for a compromise while perplexing others. John Kelly’s comments come amid a shaky effort to craft an accord protecting hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation - a push the White House and Republicans say they would back if it’s coupled with tough border security measures and other restrictions. Kelly made the remarks Wednesday at a closed-door meeting with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, participants say, and he made similar remarks later on Fox News Channel. Kelly said on Fox that he told the caucus that “they all say things during the course of campaigns that may or may not be fully informed.” He said Trump has “very definitely changed his attitude” toward protecting the young immigrants, “and even the wall, once we briefed him.” “So he has evolved in the way he’s looked at things,” Kelly said. “Campaign to governing are two different things and this president has been very, very flexible in terms of what is within the realms of the possible.” Kelly’s comments were noteworthy because they openly acknowledged the difference between campaign promises and governing, and even suggested that Trump needed to be educated on the subject. They also come as lawmakers struggle to reach a bipartisan deal protecting “Dreamers” - around 800,000 people who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children and could be deported without legal protections. Part of negotiators’ problem has been uncertainty over what Trump would accept. “He’s not yet indicated what measure he’s willing to sign,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters Wednesday. “As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I will be convinced that we would not just be spinning our wheels going to this issue on the floor.” Some lawmakers who met with Kelly Wednesday recalled his remarks differently. “He specifically said that there’s some areas of the border that didn’t needs the wall, and that the president didn’t know that when he was making his campaign promises,” Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., said in a brief interview. Another lawmaker, Rep. Luis, Gutierrez, D-Ill., said Kelly told them that “there were statements made about the wall that were not informed statements. In other words, I’ve informed the president of what it takes to build a wall, so here’s how we’re going to do it. That’s what I understood, and all of that was helpful.” Many Democrats have said that without an immigration deal in sight, they’ll vote against a Republican bill preventing a weekend government shutdown. Congressional passage must come by Friday to prevent an election-year shuttering of federal agencies that could be damaging to both parties. During his presidential campaign, Trump made it a mantra to promise to build a “beautiful” wall that would be paid for by Mexico. Since then, White House officials have repeatedly said it doesn’t have to be a concrete wall from coast to coast but could include large stretches of fencing, technology or other systems. Trump also now wants Congress to provide taxpayer money to finance it. One White House official said Wednesday that Kelly’s suggestion that Trump’s positions had evolved was inartful, and maintained Trump is still committed to his immigration priorities. Trump ended the legal shields on “Dreamers” last year and gave Congress until March to renew them. Last week, he rejected a compromise by three Democratic and three Republican senators to restore those protections, a deal that included money to begin building the wall and other security steps. Trump’s rejection angered the bargainers, and partisan feelings worsened after participants in a White House meeting last week said Trump had referred to African nations as “shitholes.” Another group of high-level lawmakers has also started talks aimed at brokering an immigration deal, adding an additional level of uncertainty. Kelly said on Fox that “there’s no doubt in my mind there’s going to be a deal” protecting the Dreamers. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said there’s “very, very strong” sentiment among Democrats in the chamber to oppose GOP-drafted legislation to keep the government’s doors open. His comments underscored the problems GOP leaders face in winning congressional passage of that legislation. The bill would keep agencies open until mid-February and finance a popular children’s health insurance program for a year. Democrats’ votes are needed to advance the stopgap measure through the Senate. It’s even unclear whether GOP leaders have nailed down enough votes to prevail in the House, where conservatives and strong boosters of the Pentagon have been unhappy. Conservative leader Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said he wants GOP leaders to add additional defense money. But he said he was pessimistic leaders would grant other conservative-backed ideas, such as the promise of a vote on a more conservative immigration bill authored by Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte, R-Va. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Colvin, Zeke Miller, Kevin Freking and Marcy Gordon contributed to this report. \-0.3052486777305603,0.38697847723960876,0.462890625,0.33528053760528564,1.1182092428207397,-0.4293854236602783,0.7167899012565613,0.3744649291038513,-0.9760581254959106,-0.8375592827796936,0.9473027586936951,0.7057175636291504,-0.3626887798309326,0.6683934926986694,0.208665132522583,-0.815988302230835,0.5314233899116516,0.18121446669101715,-0.24906548857688904,-1.9468786716461182,0.4872994124889374,-0.3573929965496063,0.11351698637008667,0.18758025765419006,-0.8614606261253357,0.12037744373083115,1.9216958284378052,0.7718844413757324,-0.2863336205482483,-0.6007298231124878,-1.0227160453796387,1.0698416233062744,0.5717912912368774,-0.026564909145236015,-0.1980215311050415,-0.6741986870765686,-0.48704588413238525,-0.036410700529813766,-0.0043559898622334,-1.4712828397750854,-0.6101996898651123,-0.9596104621887207,0.08143032342195511,-1.6325355768203735,-0.6053820848464966,0.7833922505378723,0.3009970486164093,-0.8816049695014954,-0.5837554931640625,0.07402419298887253,0.7364600300788879,-0.824100911617279,-0.5645734667778015,-0.3632708191871643,0.44337329268455505,-0.17812079191207886,0.7964021563529968,-0.008785641752183437,-1.3884284496307373,1.1283583641052246,-0.38177490234375,-0.12019689381122589,0.33578452467918396,-0.7987650036811829,-2.4924302101135254,0.7906395196914673,0.39854103326797485,1.4931079149246216,-0.7643722891807556,0.8469560146331787,0.696067214012146,-0.6562106013298035,0.34878379106521606,0.8965844511985779,-2.3140926361083984,-0.46049484610557556,-0.1792643964290619,-0.29703933000564575,-0.4355263113975525,0.4452146589756012,0.24152036011219025,0.7730714678764343,-1.5281420946121216,0.13365782797336578,1.3002822399139404,1.1686015129089355,-0.32790833711624146,-0.4051250219345093,-0.8649868965148926,-0.9276430010795593,0.12547819316387177,-0.04461510851979256,-1.6194744110107422,0.1819707602262497,-0.22425447404384613,-0.08392368257045746,-0.33781781792640686,-0.7626630663871765,-1.4714479446411133,0.06980660557746887\WASHINGTONTIMES\White House official: Trump immigration views have evolved\2018-01-18 06:45:25.0\1521, 1557, 1639, 1659
1558\Politics\WASHINGTON (AP) - For all his errant swings at the facts, President Donald Trump sometimes gets it just right. “There’s been no first year like this,” he told a Florida rally last month. Were truer words ever spoken? This Department of Corrections has certainly never seen a first year like this. Falsehoods and exaggerations have tumbled relentlessly out of Trump’s Twitter account, speeches and interviews, the vast majority in service of his ego. Other presidents have skewered the truth - George W. Bush on the pretext for the Iraq war, Barack Obama on the benefits of “Obamacare” - but Trump is of a different order of magnitude. The president routinely presents his intended actions as achievements (“Obamacare” is dead, money is “pouring” into NATO), and inflates the significance of what he’s done (calling his tax cuts the biggest ever and his accomplishments unrivaled in history - neither true). He exaggerates the problems he inherited (roads and bridges are in “total disrepair and disarray,” the border was “wide open”), lays out fanciful goals (6 percent economic growth), and doesn’t learn from mistakes. Instead he repeats them. Moreover, Trump often bypasses the vast information-gathering apparatus that reports to him in favor of getting his reality from TV, or just his gut. Some trends and highlights in his misstatements since taking office: THE ART OF THE BIGGEST BESTEST Trump doesn’t do big tax cuts. He does the biggest ever. He doesn’t win an election. He scores a “landslide.” He doesn’t just make the Veterans Affairs Department run better. He drives out the “sadists.” In fact: -The December tax overhaul ranks behind Ronald Reagan’s in the early 1980s, post-World War II tax cuts and at least several more. -His 2016 win ranks as the 13th closest of the 58 presidential elections in U.S. history, according to a tally by Claremont McKenna College political scientist John Pitney. It was no landslide. His winning percentage in the Electoral College was just under 57 percent, narrower than both of Obama’s wins (61 percent in 2008 and 62 percent in 2012) and all but two of the last 10 presidential elections. Also, he lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton. -Despite his boasts that incompetent VA employees are being swiftly removed - and enactment of a mid-year law that expedites that process - more VA employees were fired in Obama’s last budget year than in Trump’s first. ___ MISSIONS UNACCOMPLISHED Trump sees things the way he wants them to be and presents them as if that’s how they are. “You know, we have factories pouring back into our country. Did you ever think you would hear that?” ”I urged our NATO allies to do more to strengthen our crucial alliance and set the stage for significant increases in member contributions. Billions and billions of dollars are pouring in because of that initiative.” ”Jobs are pouring back into our country.” In fact: -Factories are not pouring “back” into the country, nor are they sprouting up domestically in big numbers. When he made his claim, in December, spending on the construction of factories had dropped 14 percent over the past year, continuing a steady decline since the middle of 2015. As for jobs “pouring back into our country,” Trump hopes his tax overhaul will make that happen, but it hasn’t yet. The economy added about 170,000 new jobs a month during Trump’s first year. That was slightly below the average of 185,000 in 2016. Manufacturers stepped up hiring, adding 196,000 jobs in 2017, but they added more in 2011 and 2014. -Money isn’t pouring into the NATO organization and it won’t be. What Trump really means is that he’s pushing NATO members to increase their own military budgets so the U.S. won’t carry such a heavy load. NATO members agreed during Obama’s presidency to increase their military spending in the years ahead. Whether Trump has accelerated that remains to be seen. ___ THE APOCALYPSE Trump makes the state of the union look better under his watch by making the past look as dark as can be. Before him, the U.S. “left our own border wide open. Anybody can come in.” The U.S. armed forces were all but in ruins. The health law he inherited and has tried to dismantle is a disaster that “covers very few people,” and is essentially “dead.” Previous presidents “put American energy under lock and key.” Actually: -The U.S. border was far from porous before Trump took office. The number of arrests of illegal border crossers - the best measure of how many people are trying to cross illegally - was at a 40-year low before Trump’s influence on border policy was felt. The government under presidents George W. Bush and Obama roughly doubled the ranks of the Border Patrol in the past decade or so. Obama was derided by pro-immigrant advocates as “deporter in chief” for the hefty numbers of people he sent home before easing deportations of certain groups later in his presidency. -Obamacare was covering about 20 million people when Trump described the numbers as “very few.” The majority is from the law’s Medicaid expansion. The other driver of coverage, plans sold in the subsidized individual insurance market, drew roughly 9 million signups for 2018 despite a much shorter enrollment season, and cuts in the ad budget and federal payments to insurers. The new tax law ends the Obamacare fine for lacking insurance, starting in 2019. That repeals a major component of Obama’s law, but other critical parts of the law remain in place. -Energy production was not imprisoned under previous administrations. It was unleashed, particularly during Obama’s presidency, largely because of advances in hydraulic fracturing that made it economical to tap vast reserves of natural gas. Oil production also greatly increased, reducing imports. Before the 2016 presidential election, the U.S. for the first time in decades was getting more energy domestically than it imports. Before Obama, Bush was no adversary of the energy industry. Despite Trump’s rhetoric about U.S. energy production, one of his most consequential actions as president has been to open the U.S. to another source of foreign oil, with his approval of the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada. ___ GOING WITH HIS GUT (AND TV) Trump forms instant impressions about what he sees on TV or otherwise hears about and shares those views, just as the average person does on social media or over coffee. The difference is that a president stands at a bully pulpit and his visceral reactions can change the world. -Trump strained relations with Britain by retweeting videos spread by a far-right British fringe group that purported to show Muslim extremism. “Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!” said the introduction to one video, which showed a young man attacking another who was on crutches. The attacker was not a Muslim migrant. He was a Dutch-born citizen who was arrested and sentenced for the crime. “Facts do matter,” the Dutch Embassy in Washington said in a tweet directed at Trump. -The president puzzled plenty of people in February when he told a rally that immigration is spreading violence and extremism in Sweden, pointing to “what’s happening last night in Sweden.” Nothing extraordinary happened in Sweden the previous night, Feb. 17. It happened to be when Trump saw an analyst talking about the subject on Fox News. But he soon claimed vindication of his statement anyway, telling Time magazine the next month: “I make the statement, everyone goes crazy. The next day they have a massive riot, and death, and problems.” That wasn’t right, either. Two days after his rally, a riot broke out in a largely immigrant neighborhood after police arrested a drug crime suspect. Cars were set on fire and shops looted, but no one was killed. Attacks in the country related to extremism remain rare; the biggest surprise for many Swedes was that a police officer found it necessary to fire his gun. -When an Amtrak train hurtled off the tracks in Washington state in December, killing three people and injuring dozens, Trump’s first impulse was to make a plug for his infrastructure plan. Only after that did he offer thoughts and prayers for the victims and thanks for rescuers. His opening tweet: “The train accident that just occurred in DuPont, WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly. Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads, bridges, tunnels, railways (and more) crumble! Not for long!” Although he jumped to his conclusion within a few hours of the crash, it’s taking investigators months to reach a conclusion that is informed by the facts. But this much was obvious right away: The train was making its inaugural run along a fast, new route, not a crumbling line of the type that would be a priority of a national infrastructure plan. And the train was going over twice the speed limit. ___ IT’S WHO YOU KNOW, AND DON’T Trump has claimed to know certain people well, only to circle back to say he hardly knew them all. His familiarity with them has varied according to political circumstance. So it was when George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser, pleaded guilty in October to lying about his Russian interactions. “Few people knew the young, low level volunteer,” Trump tweeted in response. After naming Papadopoulos to his campaign’s foreign policy advisory council in March 2016, Trump called him an “excellent guy” and tweeted a photo of his council meeting with Papadopoulos among several advisers. Steve Bannon got such treatment months before his ouster as White House strategist last year. Trump said he had known him for “many years” when Bannon became his campaign chief in August 2016. When Bannon’s tenure as White House strategist was getting dicey in April, Trump said “I didn’t know him” when Bannon was named campaign CEO. Trump and Bannon had known each other for five years when the Republican candidate, a month after accepting the nomination, made him campaign chief. David Bossie, who was deputy campaign manager, told AP he introduced them in 2011 at Trump Tower and they grew to know each well, as Trump appeared multiple times on Bannon’s Breitbart radio show. Bannon interviewed Trump at least nine times in 2015 and 2016 and members of his family and campaign on many other occasions. “They believe in each other’s agendas, which is why they have grown so close,” Bossie said. ___ Associated Press writers Jim Drinkard, Josh Boak, Christopher Rugaber, Hope Yen, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Jill Colvin and Lolita C.

1559\Politics\BOSTON (AP) - Thousands of Haitian immigrants living in the U.S. legally will face employment and travel hurdles because President Donald Trump’s administration delayed the process of re-registering those with temporary protected status, Haitian community leaders and immigrant activists say. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will release details Thursday about the next steps for the 60,000 Haitians with the special status, an agency spokeswoman told The Associated Press. But the information comes too late to help the thousands of Haitians who hold immigration documents that show their legal and work status expiring Monday, said immigrants and advocates, some of whom wondered - in light of the president’s recent remarks about Haiti - if the bureaucratic slowdown was deliberate. “They told me that if I don’t bring the work papers, they will send me home because it is the law. You have to have work papers. I am under pressure,” said Edelyne Jean, a 35-year-old nursing assistant in Coral Springs, Florida, who supports four younger siblings still in Haiti. “They say that if I don’t bring anything new by Jan. 22 or the 23rd at the most, I am jobless.” Haitian workers like Jean will be left at the mercy of employers, who could simply choose to let them go or hire someone else rather than wait for a process that could take months, says Rev. Dieufort Fleurissaint, chairman of Haitian Americans United, a Boston-based community group. “They’re putting a lot of people in a very, very difficult situation,” he said of federal officials. “Employers are not going to take time to understand this. People will be in limbo come Monday.” Haitians were granted temporary protected status to live and work in the U.S. after a devastating earthquake struck their Caribbean homeland in 2010. The status has been renewed a number of times over the past seven years, to the chagrin of critics who say the humanitarian measure was never meant to allow immigrants to establish roots in the U.S. The Trump administration announced in November that Haitians living under the temporary status would have until July 2019 to get their affairs in order and return home. The problem is that officials haven’t told people with that status how to go about renewing it. Other groups eligible for similar status have received more lead time to re-register; the administration announced extensions for Nicaraguans and Hondurans last month and has already issued renewal guidelines for them. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services wasn’t able to release details about the re-registration process for Haitians sooner because officials had to work out the work authorization language, among other things. But Thursday’s announcement will automatically extend the work permits for Haitians on temporary protected status through July, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokeswoman Sharon Scheidhauer said. And Haitian workers will be able to simply show employers the agency’s Thursday notice as proof their work status is still valid until their new employment documents arrive, she added. Nevertheless, the bureaucratic slowdown “reinforces the message” that Haitians aren’t welcome in America, says Geralde Gabeau, a Haitian immigrant who heads the Immigrant Family Services Institute, a Boston-based nonprofit that provide academic support to immigrant youths. “It goes hand-in-hand with what the president said last week,” she said, referring to the closed-door meeting Trump held with U.S. senators during which he profanely disparaged African countries and asked why the U.S. would want more Haitians. “It’s not just words. It’s actions. They don’t want Haitians here, so they’re doing whatever they can to discourage them so that they go back to their country.” At least in Boston, which has the nation’s third-largest Haitian community after Miami and New York, the delays have already led to job losses, Fleurissaint said. Some Haitians working as porters, janitors and food service workers at Boston’s Logan International Airport were let go this summer because they didn’t receive new work permits before the most recent expiration date for temporary protected status, which was in July, he said. And a woman in Massachusetts was warned by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services this week that she wouldn’t be able to re-enter the country if she attempted to attend her father’s funeral in Haiti this weekend, Gabeau said. Haitians on temporary protected status could encounter other hurdles, like renewing their driver’s licenses, says Sarang Sekhavat, director of federal policy at the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, or MIRA. Haitian community leaders are gathering lawyers to assist families as problems arise. “We’re going to be fighting back,” Gabeau said. “We will not stay silent. This is not acceptable.” ___ Follow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.

1560\Politics\Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Wednesday that the continued focus on President Trump’s harsh comments at a meeting last week are doing a disservice to her department’s law enforcement personnel. Ms. Nielsen also fired back at a Democratic senator who said she lied under oath by having a different recollection about last week’s controversial comments, saying they’re actually trying to make her lie. “I am thoroughly disappointed that attention continues to be given to a meeting I attended a week ago when we have serious and urgent border and immigration issues to address. That is unfair to our communities, our frontline officers and agents, DACA recipients, and the constituents of those who are spending precious time impugning my character,” the secretary said. On Tuesday Ms. Nielsen testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that many of the people in the meeting used rough language, including the president, but she didn’t specifically recall him using the word Sen. Richard J. Durbin has claimed. Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat eyeing a presidential run against Mr. Trump, declared himself enraged at her answer, and later accused her of lying to Congress. “She pretended like she didn’t remember. She couldn’t remember what the president of the United States, the commander-in-chief, her boss, was saying,” Mr. Booker said on CBS News. Ms. Nielsen was on Capitol Hill Wednesday to try to help negotiations on a deal to legalize illegal immigrant “Dreamers” and improve immigration enforcement. While others have labeled it a “DACA fix,” referring to the amnesty for illegal immigrants, Ms. Nielsen called it a “border security deal,” suggesting her focus was on the security side. \0.3357689082622528,0.22071878612041473,0.15384118258953094,0.12854161858558655,0.9109019041061401,0.012674032710492611,0.35649871826171875,0.20074434578418732,-0.019906794652342796,-0.7587814331054688,0.4979400634765625,0.9053421020507812,-0.5291928648948669,0.38745152950286865,0.5439656376838684,-0.39891141653060913,0.38860058784484863,-0.049267951399087906,-0.41558638215065,-0.42335179448127747,-0.20963357388973236,-0.09550150483846664,0.20114395022392273,-0.15525270998477936,-1.2035118341445923,0.35127130150794983,0.6797791719436646,-0.031751636415719986,-0.15796829760074615,-0.46915340423583984,0.02963479794561863,0.42959603667259216,-0.6702378392219543,-0.32600337266921997,1.0321929454803467,-0.04040035977959633,0.2259398102760315,-0.16539603471755981,0.11181418597698212,-0.6345778107643127,-0.055910661816596985,-0.3404082655906677,-0.09256718307733536,-1.4803935289382935,-0.3801458179950714,-0.33012983202934265,0.3738206923007965,-0.26615333557128906,0.005821986123919487,-0.2639346122741699,0.15295331180095673,0.7446626424789429,0.2541242241859436,0.28332996368408203,0.9246073365211487,-0.7974608540534973,0.5461125373840332,-0.9559439420700073,-0.3541283905506134,0.7705475091934204,-0.5699897408485413,0.26036539673805237,-0.4253379702568054,-0.0858391523361206,-1.2448703050613403,0.6882895827293396,0.8578325510025024,0.6630605459213257,-0.5366831421852112,0.6835645437240601,0.14576739072799683,-0.17483097314834595,0.17975246906280518,-0.007437707390636206,-0.7794364094734192,-0.1583893597126007,0.6645386219024658,-0.19202011823654175,-0.3921065628528595,0.6045884490013123,-0.17557847499847412,0.29418909549713135,-0.09266994893550873,0.5498044490814209,0.46888816356658936,0.4423134922981262,-0.46843376755714417,0.5016551613807678,-0.20168451964855194,-0.2327844649553299,0.40541958808898926,-0.5138007402420044,-0.89351886510849,-0.20980936288833618,-0.1552596241235733,0.45130935311317444,0.19459295272827148,-0.7903221845626831,-1.427708387374878,0.10184396058320999\WASHINGTONTIMES\Kirstjen Nielsen: Democrats insult Border Patrol with focus on 's---hole' comment\2018-01-18 04:07:41.0\1560, 1645
1561\Politics\President Trump’s ex-chief strategist Steve Bannon struck a deal Wednesday to be interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, avoiding the need to appear before a grand jury, according to multiple sources. The move was widely seen as a sign the former member of the president’s inner circle is now cooperating with Mr. Mueller’s probe of alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Kremlin. The combative strategist has seen events unfold rapidly since his fall from power after being quoted extensively in a tell-all book earlier this month calling the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., and others “treasonous” for taking a meeting with Russians during the 2016 campaign seeking information on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Last week, FBI agents showed up at Mr. Bannon’s Washington home to serve him with a subpoena from Mr. Mueller. On Tuesday, while he was spending almost 12 hours behind closed doors testifying to the House Intelligence Committee’s Russia probe, news broke of the Mueller subpoena. During the House hearing, Mr. Bannon refused to answer a wide range of questions about his time working for Mr. Trump during the presidential transition or in the White House, leading the committee chairman to authorize a second subpoena. Afterward, committee members said that Mr. Bannon didn’t specifically assert the legal concept of “executive privilege” to avoid answering questions, but suggested that some of their questions brushed up against the idea that legally protects the president’s conversations. The White House acknowledged Wednesday it shared Mr. Bannon’s concerns, but the argument angered committee members from both parties. On Wednesday, Rep. Trey Gowdy blasted Mr. Bannon for speaking to a book author but refusing to answer the committee’s questions. “I am frustrated whenever people assert privileges that do not exist,” the South Carolina Republican told Fox News. Led by Rep. Adam Schiff, committee Democrats said Mr. Bannon acted as if he were under a “gag order” from the White House. On Wednesday, The Associated Press reported that Mr. Bannon’s lawyer, Bill Burck, had communicated by phone with White House attorneys as the House hearing was underway. Later Wednesday, the White House pushed back hard against the notion the administration was attempting to control Mr. Bannon. While defending the use of executive privilege, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that communication between Mr. Bannon’s lawyer and White House attorneys was “standard procedure.” “Sometimes, they actually have a White House attorney present in the room,” Ms. Sanders said. “This time, it was something that was relayed via phone and, again, was following standard procedure for an instance like this, and something that will likely happen again on any other number of occasions, not just within this administration, but future administrations.” Also on Wednesday, it was former Trump campaign aide Corey Lewandowski’s turn to testify behind closed doors on Capitol Hill. He has previously said he saw no signs of collusion with Russia at any time during his service in the campaign. A status hearing for former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was postponed for up to 90 days. Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI in October, revealing at the time that he had already been cooperating with Mr. Mueller’s probe. While the White House dismissed him as a low-level volunteer, Mr. Papadopoulos has claimed that he was constantly in touch with high-level Trump campaign officials, including Mr. Bannon, as he corresponded with Russian officials. \0.0800691768527031,0.6713448166847229,-0.309320330619812,0.19054913520812988,0.6850694417953491,-0.33784019947052,0.5720880627632141,0.27559512853622437,-1.395980954170227,-0.34918954968452454,0.055043019354343414,0.5458614826202393,-0.29947954416275024,1.0432648658752441,-0.29314106702804565,0.6126423478126526,0.32573050260543823,0.9769677519798279,0.3679165244102478,-0.9047284722328186,0.7929797768592834,-0.6679238080978394,-0.2080984115600586,0.1914019137620926,-1.8357609510421753,0.2812758982181549,1.7367571592330933,1.2386375665664673,-0.6676311492919922,0.1734277606010437,0.529064953327179,0.7775622010231018,0.3780995309352875,0.4550815522670746,1.1270804405212402,0.07547780871391296,-0.5234456062316895,0.289898157119751,-0.6355333924293518,-0.8608840107917786,-0.4194294214248657,-0.6103812456130981,0.34799647331237793,-0.13330966234207153,0.5366493463516235,-0.07620871812105179,-0.09389372169971466,0.3585951328277588,-1.1754165887832642,0.6896622776985168,0.49217185378074646,-0.43375900387763977,0.39029645919799805,-0.44777509570121765,0.7817801833152771,-0.8785908818244934,0.1708860993385315,-0.7675256133079529,-1.0616847276687622,1.1988633871078491,-0.7397587895393372,-0.34150829911231995,-0.49451345205307007,-0.009308548644185066,-0.6880295276641846,-0.4224119186401367,0.6928512454032898,1.493371605873108,-1.2336084842681885,1.6758760213851929,0.2165008932352066,-0.23710036277770996,-0.6684317588806152,1.0704731941223145,-0.4816332459449768,0.39570027589797974,0.901636004447937,0.607282817363739,-1.4327187538146973,-0.5103208422660828,0.1469060778617859,0.4449392557144165,-1.8217445611953735,-0.07568530738353729,0.6055879592895508,0.9577683210372925,0.9166314601898193,1.23839271068573,-0.1702318638563156,0.34055987000465393,0.7043826580047607,-0.07956071943044662,-2.7644598484039307,-0.1725175976753235,-0.11091761291027069,-0.03381120041012764,-1.089800477027893,-0.9970823526382446,-1.1250858306884766,-0.3039882779121399\WASHINGTONTIMES\Steve Bannon to be interviewed by Robert Mueller\2018-01-18 03:37:10.0\1516, 1561, 1760, 1650, 1652, 1774
1562\Politics\The web site for President Trump’s “fake news awards” crashed around 8 p.m. Wednesday as the president announced the much-anticipated event on Twitter. To nobody’s surprise, CNN made the dubious awards list four times, and the New York Times twice. Mr. Trump provided a link to the web site GOP.com with a showman’s flourish by commenting on Twitter, “And the FAKE NEWS winners are…” It linked to a web site with a list of 11 news reports, but many users couldn’t access the site, apparently due to heavy demand. Fox News posted the list of “winners”: 1st — The New York Times’ Paul Krugman claiming markets would “never” recover from a Trump presidency. 2nd — ABC News’ Brian Ross’ bungled report on former national security adviser Michael Flynn. 3rd — CNN’s report that the Trump campaign had early access to hacked documents from WikiLeaks. 4th — TIME’s report that Mr. Trump removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office. 5th — The Washington Post’s Dave Weigel tweeting that Mr. Trump’s December rally in Pensacola, Florida, wasn’t packed with supporters. 6th — CNN’s video suggesting that Mr. Trump overfed fish during a visit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 7th—CNN’s retracted report claiming Anthony Scaramucci-Russia ties. 8th — Newsweek’s report that Polish First Lady Agata Kornhauser-Duda did not shake Mr. Trump’s hand. 9th — CNN’s report that former FBI Director James B. Comey would dispute Mr. Trump’s claim he was told he was not under investigation. 10th — The New York Times’ report that the Trump administration had hidden a climate-change report. 11th— In Mr. Trump’s words, “RUSSIA COLLUSION!’ Russian collusion is perhaps the greatest hoax perpetrated on the American people. THERE IS NO COLLUSION!” The web site asserted that “studies have shown that over 90 percent of the media’s coverage of President Trump is negative.” It called 2017 “a year of unrelenting bias, unfair news coverage and even downright fake news.” The president had promised supporters that he’d honor “the most corrupt & biased of the Mainstream Media,” after having pushed back the original date from Jan. 8. On Twitter, Mr. Trump followed up the announcement by saying, “Despite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage, there are many great reporters I respect and lots of GOOD NEWS for the American people to be proud of!” “ISIS is in retreat, our economy is booming, investments and jobs are pouring back into the country, and so much more! Together there is nothing we can’t overcome—even a very biased media. We ARE Making America Great Again!” the president tweeted. Ahead of the announcement, Arizona’s Republican senators, Jeff Flake and John McCain, criticized the president for feuding with the media. \0.4084973633289337,-0.15857146680355072,0.3706333637237549,1.03750479221344,0.16248659789562225,0.038158345967531204,0.39609766006469727,0.6956764459609985,-0.831075131893158,-0.26702332496643066,0.42557287216186523,0.1823522001504898,-1.0414543151855469,0.6933070421218872,-0.35695281624794006,0.7309350967407227,-0.2481967806816101,0.13247445225715637,-0.10885148495435715,-0.9923112392425537,0.6604218482971191,0.0528273731470108,-0.7031123638153076,-0.13396218419075012,-1.108998417854309,1.1024168729782104,0.9795699119567871,0.4337679147720337,-0.47171786427497864,-0.9754244685173035,0.7349435091018677,0.14730504155158997,-0.9601715803146362,-0.046814076602458954,0.6663930416107178,0.11342305690050125,-0.7042207717895508,-0.4145504832267761,0.5011017918586731,-0.7015677094459534,-0.16574792563915253,-0.22350607812404633,0.8457322716712952,-1.3680543899536133,1.2543776035308838,0.20868848264217377,0.5145161747932434,0.18205411732196808,-0.5587447285652161,-0.6887490153312683,1.3961591720581055,-0.1954983025789261,-0.3819047808647156,-0.051066804677248,0.8490678071975708,-0.06382937729358673,-0.49771130084991455,0.3411882519721985,-0.8205408453941345,1.0157687664031982,-0.21429283916950226,-0.9372174739837646,-0.5009739995002747,-0.9171674847602844,-0.31309741735458374,0.5138686299324036,0.9208430051803589,-0.07796252518892288,-0.9112357497215271,1.136496663093567,0.09596385806798935,-0.6736128926277161,0.1562545895576477,0.5435729026794434,-0.6921451687812805,-0.41765087842941284,0.3922135531902313,0.5258645415306091,-1.533836841583252,-0.5059379935264587,-0.04524508863687515,0.38960325717926025,-0.044033125042915344,0.6492763161659241,0.4016351103782654,0.5256235599517822,-0.032256659120321274,0.5854438543319702,0.5439605712890625,-0.34386491775512695,0.9192032814025879,0.10282652080059052,-0.8522768616676331,-0.18210934102535248,0.5408076643943787,-0.4399475157260895,-0.06274500489234924,-0.8134467005729675,-0.6071909070014954,-1.0437895059585571\WASHINGTONTIMES\CNN, New York Times top Trump's list of 'fake news' awards\2018-01-18 02:44:38.0\
1563\Politics\It would be a dream come true for Democrats if grass-roots voters were to abandon President Trump. That does not appear to be happening. Mr. Trump’s favorability numbers, in fact, are pretty darn good, according to a new Zogby Analytics survey which finds that the president now has a 46 percent approval rating among all likely voters — just shy of a majority. But Mr. Trump’s biggest fans are found among some very specific demographics, suggesting that the millions of heartland folks who stepped up and elected him are still by his side. “The president’s job approval rating is very strong among certain groups,” the Zogby analysis said. For one thing, Mr. Trump has a 64 percent approval rating among NASCAR fans. In theory, this could be considered a prized voting bloc. According to Forbes magazine, there are an estimated 75 million stock-car racing fans out there. Zogby also found that 58 percent of regular Walmart shoppers also give the president a big thumbs-up. That amounts to 140 million shoppers, according to Walmart itself. Critics would squawk over such a correlation. The numbers for NASCAR and Walmart don’t turn into instant votes, of course. Nonetheless, the survey has taken the political pulse of some jumbo demographics which often go ignored by pollsters, not to mention the press. Meanwhile, Zogby also found that 52 percent of homeowners — and even 57 percent of voters who have recently lost their jobs — offer a positive review of the president. “Trump’s numbers are also up among groups he has recently had trouble with, including union voters (48 percent approval), voters living in small cities (47 percent), and voters earning $75,000-$100,000 annually (57 percent approval),” the analysis said. “The president’s numbers have improved because he has rebounded with some elements of his base. Trump’s numbers with men and women are both better. Among men, his job approval is 52 percent, while support among women has crept up to 40 percent,” the report noted. “One of our survey indicators we use to measure how the economy is doing is to ask voters ‘How do you feel the next four years will be for the U.S. economy?’ The numbers are very positive — 54 percent believe things will be good.” THOSE DEMOCRATIC CONCERNS What issues do Democratic voters care about? There are 17 of them, judging from a list now being circulated by Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota — who is also deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He is asking fellow Dems to gauge just how much they care — whether it’s a little or a lot. “2017 was a challenging year, with the GOP forcing their reckless agenda onto the American people. But for every challenge we faced, we rolled up our sleeves — and as a result, we celebrated some historic victories. As we step into 2018, we know there’s still much more to do and we can’t take our foot off the gas if we want to keep bringing the fight to Republicans. That’s why we need your input,” Mr. Ellison said. Curious? Here are the issues, verbatim from his public outreach: Jobs and income security, taxes, climate change, immigration, health care, racial justice, education, gun violence prevention, voting rights, national security, foreign policy, criminal justice reform, civil rights, college affordability and student debt, women’s reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights and retirement security. MAJORITY SAYS ABORTION ‘MORALLY WRONG’ The 45th annual March for Life approaches, considered the largest pro-life demonstration in the world and set to draw a minimum of 100,000 devotees to the National Mall on Friday in a show of strength. They have company. A majority of Americans — 56 percent — now consider abortion to be “morally wrong,” while 76 percent would limit abortion to — at most — the first three months of pregnancy, according to a new Marist Poll. “The survey found that 76 percent of Americans want such limits. Strong majorities of Republicans (92 percent), independents (78 percent) and Democrats (61 percent) agree, as do a majority of those who identify as pro-choice (60 percent),” says the pollster, which also found that 60 percent oppose tax dollars used to pay for abortions. President Trump (speaking via video) and GOP House Speaker Paul D. Ryan headline the guest list for the march. “Since his first day in office, President Trump has remained steadfast on his campaign promises to the pro-life cause and has actively worked to protect the unborn,” said Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life. “Over the past year, the Trump administration has significantly advanced pro-life policy, and it is with great confidence that, under his leadership, we expect to see other pro-life achievements in the years to come.” Marist University conducted the research on behalf of the Knights of Columbus. “It is hardly surprising that after 50 million abortions in this country, an overwhelming majority of the American people want substantial limits,” observes Carl Anderson, Supreme Knight of the Catholic men’s organization. “This survey shows clearly that the pro-choice label can no longer be assumed to mean support for abortion on demand. Nor can abortion be thought of as a partisan issue since majorities of Democrats, independents and Republicans all agree that it should be substantially restricted. It is high time that our political debates reflected this national consensus.” THE ADOPTION ALTERNATIVE A half-dozen Louisiana Republicans gather on Thursday evening to introduce a new film which champions adoption. “I Lived on Parker Avenue” details the story of David Scotton, who was adopted at birth, raised in Louisiana and ultimately journeyed as an adult to meet the birth parents he never knew.

1564\Politics\JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) - Alaska Gov. Bill Walker is proposing legislation that would stiffen the penalties for distributing larger quantities of drugs and would allow judges to consider out-of-state criminal histories when determining bail and release conditions. He says current state laws for drug distribution have little deterrent effect on those importing larger amounts of drugs into the state. Walker also wants to allow the state attorney general to schedule controlled substances by regulation on an emergency basis as a way to address emergent new drugs. The bills are part of a suite of measures that Walker sees as proactive steps to improve public safety. \-0.6206508874893188,-0.23644569516181946,-0.3374885022640228,0.1686192750930786,0.6480087041854858,0.02335996739566326,0.46812593936920166,0.1079326719045639,-0.828544557094574,-0.17644597589969635,0.23930519819259644,0.5176378488540649,0.071993887424469,0.4748055636882782,0.28475451469421387,0.5269849896430969,0.17997919023036957,-0.25898075103759766,-0.028134172782301903,0.1051514744758606,0.5267421007156372,0.16552689671516418,0.02337362803518772,0.2328377515077591,-0.30969440937042236,0.39785322546958923,-0.07853814214468002,0.012525834143161774,0.18768610060214996,0.05010915547609329,-0.513795018196106,0.09841138869524002,-0.2028525322675705,-0.4503926932811737,0.1690474897623062,-0.40071165561676025,0.009136070497334003,0.35532063245773315,0.6760199666023254,0.30413979291915894,-0.08743519335985184,0.053719375282526016,-0.04514198750257492,-0.05806951969861984,-0.6913455724716187,0.17305387556552887,0.3433842957019806,0.1948346495628357,-0.2716437578201294,-0.4415784478187561,0.215682253241539,-0.25129956007003784,0.06454472243785858,0.04773090034723282,0.3572888970375061,-0.4223951995372772,0.05475618690252304,0.13693742454051971,-0.8549280762672424,0.2555623948574066,0.18485289812088013,0.5912304520606995,-0.2481958568096161,0.013888977468013763,-0.164102703332901,-0.5606828331947327,-0.11752092838287354,0.5748549699783325,-0.2414586991071701,0.25905025005340576,0.6533616781234741,0.012781044468283653,0.13847950100898743,-0.5352697968482971,0.17708171904087067,-0.2764127850532532,0.22365441918373108,0.33081570267677307,0.30461585521698,-0.11986386030912399,0.24308398365974426,0.24969200789928436,-0.2399250566959381,0.5690164566040039,-0.26416391134262085,0.5181661248207092,0.6153008341789246,-0.33091527223587036,0.18302862346172333,0.05489213019609451,-0.08836520463228226,-0.020057084038853645,0.1387619972229004,-0.17755542695522308,-0.09697927534580231,0.18481555581092834,0.7954514622688293,-0.2080926150083542,-0.8217340111732483,-0.08858530223369598\WASHINGTONTIMES\Alaska governor proposes bills to address crime\2018-01-18 02:20:40.0\

Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock Donald Trump has contradicted his chief of staff over proposals for a wall along the southern US border with Mexico, tweeting that his opinion on a wall “has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it”. On Wednesday evening, the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, said the US president’s views on immigration and a border wall had “very definitely changed” after Trump had been briefed on the subjects. However, in the early hours of Thursday morning, Trump tweeted: “The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it.” Kelly’s comments came amid a shaky effort to craft an accord protecting hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation – a push the White House and Republicans say they would support if it is coupled with tough border security measures and other restrictions. “If there is no Wall, there is no Deal!” Trump tweeted on Thursday. Trump claims Mexico will pay for wall – day after seeking $18bn from Congress Read more Kelly first spoke of the president’s evolving views at a closed-door meeting with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, participants said, and he made similar remarks later on Fox News. Kelly said on Fox News he had told the caucus that “they [presidential candidates] all say things during the course of campaigns that may or may not be fully informed”. Trump had “very definitely changed his attitude” toward protecting the young immigrants, “and even the wall, once we briefed him”, Kelly added. “So he has evolved in the way he’s looked at things. Campaign to governing are two different things and this president has been very, very flexible in terms of what is within the realms of the possible.” Politicians are struggling to reach a bipartisan deal protecting Dreamers – about 800,000 people who arrived in the US illegally as children and could be deported without legal protections. Part of the negotiators’ problem has been uncertainty over what Trump would accept. Quick guide What now for Daca and the Dreamers? Show Hide Who are the Dreamers? Dreamers are young immigrants who would qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (Daca) program, enacted under Barack Obama in 2012. Most people in the program entered the US as children and have lived in the US for years “undocumented”. Daca gave them temporary protection from deportation and work permits. Daca was only available to people younger than 31 on 15 June 2012, who arrived in the US before turning 16 and lived there continuously since June 2007. Most Dreamers are from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras and the largest numbers live in California, Texas, Florida and New York. Donald Trump cancelled the program in September but has also said repeatedly he wants Congress to develop a program to “help” the population. What will happen to the Dreamers? Under the Trump administration, new applications under Daca will no longer be accepted. For those currently in the program, their legal status and other Daca-related permits (such as to work and attend college) will begin expiring in March 2018 – unless Congress passes legislation allowing a new channel for temporary or permanent legal immigration status – and Dreamers will all lose their status by March 2020. Technically, as their statuses lapse they could be deported and sent back to countries many have no familiarity with. It is still unclear whether this would happen. Fear had been rising in the run-up to last week’s announcement. Those with work permits expiring between 5 September 2017 and 5 March 2018 will be allowed to apply for renewal by 5 October. What does this week's ruling by Judge William Alsup mean? In his ruling, Alsup ordered the Trump administration to restart the program, allowing Daca recipients who already qualify for the program to submit applications for renewal. However, he said the federal government did not have to process new applications from people who had not previously received protection under the program. When the Trump administration ended the Daca program, it allowed Daca recipients whose legal status expired on or before 5 March to renew their legal status. Roughly 22,000 recipients failed to successfully renew their legal status for various reasons. Legal experts and immigration advocates are advising Daca recipients not to file for renewal until the administration provides more information about how it intends to comply with the ruling. “These next days and weeks are going to create a lot of confusion on the legal front,” said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, which has filed a separate lawsuit against the Trump administration’s termination of Daca. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. Some politicians who met Kelly on Wednesday recalled his remarks differently. “He specifically said that there’s some areas of the border that didn’t need the wall, and that the president didn’t know that when he was making his campaign promises,” Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, told the Associated Press. The Illinois Democrat Luis Gutiérrez said Kelly had told them “there were statements made about the wall that were not informed statements. In other words, ‘I’ve informed the president of what it takes to build a wall, so here’s how we’re going to do it.’ That’s what I understood, and all of that was helpful”. On Thursday, Trump tweeted that some of the wall would be “see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water …” Many Democrats have said that without an immigration deal in sight, they will vote against a Republican bill preventing a government shutdown this weekend. Congressional passage must come by Friday to prevent an election-year shuttering of federal agencies that could be damaging to both parties. Part of congressional negotiators’ problem has been uncertainty over what Trump would accept. “He’s not yet indicated what measure he’s willing to sign,” the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, told reporters on Wednesday. “As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I will be convinced that we would not just be spinning our wheels going to this issue on the floor.” Trump ended the legal shields on Dreamers last year and gave Congress until March to renew them. Last week, he rejected a compromise by three Democratic and three Republican senators to restore those protections, a deal that included money to begin building the wall and other security steps. Trump’s rejection angered the bargainers, and partisan feelings worsened after participants in a White House meeting last week said Trump had referred to African nations as “shitholes”. Another group of high-level lawmakers has also started talks aimed at brokering an immigration deal, adding an additional level of uncertainty. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said there was “very, very strong” sentiment among Democrats in the chamber to oppose GOP-drafted legislation to keep the government’s doors open. His comments underscored the problems GOP leaders face in winning congressional passage of that legislation. The bill would keep agencies open until mid-February and finance a popular children’s health insurance program for a year. Democrats’ votes are needed to advance the stopgap measure through the Senate. It is even unclear whether GOP leaders have nailed down enough votes to prevail in the House, where conservatives and strong boosters of the Pentagon have been unhappy.

It is not known who the MP was talking about or where the prisoner was being held. Photograph: Kaveh Kazemi/Getty Images An Iranian protester who died in custody was forced to take pills that made him sick, his family have claimed, as secrecy shrouds the similar deaths of other prisoners. Little is known about the circumstances leading to the death of at least five protesters rounded up in mass arrests during Iran’s largest protests in nearly a decade. At least 25 people died in clashes during the unrest, which began on 28 December over economic grievances and spread across the country. After two weeks the protests died out in the face of a crackdown. Mahmoud Sadeghi, an outspoken MP who has scrutinised the authorities’ conduct of the crackdown, has said about 3,700 people were arrested during the protests. A series of tweets by Sadeghi since the unrest have been a rare source of information from within the country. “According to the relatives of one of the detainees who died in jail, he had told his family during a phone conversation [prior to his death] that the authorities had forced him and other prisoners to take pills that made them sick,” Sadeghi tweeted on Tuesday. On Thursday the organisation in charge of Iranian prisons denied prisoners had been forced to take medicine, calling the claims “lies and big accusations”, the semi-official Isna news agency reported. The MP did not reveal the identity of the prisoner, but at least three of those who have died in jail have been identified. Sina Ghanbari, 23, died in Tehran’s Evin prison, the country’s most notorious jail. Authorities said he killed himself. The semi-official Fars news agency published a letter it claimed had been written by Ghanbari’s family in which they said they had no plans to hold a funeral ceremony because “enemies” were planning to hijack it. It was not possible to independently verify whether the letter was written by Ghanbari’s family or, if so, whether they wrote it voluntarily. Another dead prisoner was named as Saro Ghahramani, 24. His relatives have claimed that his body was handed over 11 days after he disappeared during anti-government protests in the western city of Sanandaj. Iranian state news agencies, however, released a video purporting to show Gahramani’s father saying he had links with a banned Kurdish opposition group fighting the Islamic Republic and had been killed in armed clashes. Human rights activists cast doubt on the veracity of the video’s claim, saying Ghahramani’s father had been coerced. The New York-based Centre for Human Rights in Iran quoted an unnamed relative of Ghahramani as saying the video showed “a father’s forced confession against his son”. Iran has a history of resorting to forced confessions, a familiar pattern used against prisoners of conscience and their associates. Ghahramani’s mother previously claimed that her son’s body bore signs of torture and beatings. Only his parents were allowed to attend a funeral, according to media reports. The case drew widespread attention after Bahareh Rahnama, a well-known actor in Iran, said on Twitter that Ghahramani had worked as a delivery man for a restaurant she owns. Rahnama described him as “a calm and shy” person who “often worried about his mother”. A photo posted on Twitter of Bahareh Rahnama with Saro Ghahramani She later tweeted that local authorities had contacted her to say Ghahramani “was killed because of his collaboration with a terrorist organisation”. Some semi-official news agencies published unverified photos of Ghahramani apparently posing with a pistol. Another prisoner named was Mohammad Heydari, 22, who died while held in detention at a police station in the city of Arak. Authorities said he had taken his own life. Iran’s former president Mohammad Khatami said this week that all political institutions in Iran should share the blame for the public discontent, and asked officials not to humiliate people and to refrain from “pouring salt in their wounds”. Sadeghi and more than 40 other MPs have written to the parliamentary speaker asking for an independent inquiry into the suspicious deaths. It emerged on Wednesday that a female student, Leila Hosseinzadeh, whose case drew nationwide attention, had been released.

Photograph: Pierre Crom/Getty Images Violent gales have battered north-west Europe, killing at least five people, toppling trees and trucks, bringing down power lines, grounding aircraft and halting road and rail traffic across the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. All long-distance train services were cancelled in Germany after the Netherlands bore the early brunt of the second major winter storm this month, with Schiphol airport in Amsterdam suspending all traffic for two hours and closing two of its three departure halls as tiles flew off the terminal building. More than 260 flights were cancelled as winds of up to 90mph (140km/h) prompted the Dutch weather service to issue a nationwide red alert, the highest alarm level. Services resumed later but with severe delays. A 62-year-old man was killed in the central village of Olst when he was hit by a falling branch as he got out of his lorry to remove debris from the road, while another 62-year-old died in the eastern city of Enschede when a tree fell on to his car, and a 66-year-old man died in a fall believed to have been caused by the high winds. Play Video 0:17 Powerful winds in the Netherlands push people to the ground – video In Rotterdam, shipping containers were toppled and roofs ripped off homes. Europe’s busiest cargo port was “virtually unreachable from the north” because of traffic holdups on three of the main motorways into the city, the national traffic service VID said. At least 25 large freight trucks had been knocked on their sides by the winds, causing huge traffic jams on six of the country’s main roads. The Dutch national railways service, NS, halted all trains for most of the morning except for local services in the south of the country and warned that “a large number of breakdowns” meant normal service could take hours to restore. Neighbouring Belgium halted the high-speed Thalys services to the Netherlands and Germany. Play Video 0:13 Solar panels blown off Netherlands apartment building - video In Germany, where gusts of wind reached up to 80mph (130km/h), a 59-year-old man was killed by a falling tree in Emmerich near the Dutch border and several more injured. Up to 100,000 were left without electricity, flights were cancelled at Düsseldorf and Cologne-Bonn airports, and train services cancelled in the states of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia. Schools were closed as a precautionary measure in many parts of the country and Germans – particularly in western regions – were warned to stay indoors if at all possible. Heavy snowfall and slippery roads were causing car accidents “every other minute” on some roads in northern Germany, authorities said, and the square in front of Cologne’s cathedral was cordoned off in case of falling debris. The Belgian port of Ghent was temporarily closed, and a woman was killed near Brussels when her car was crushed by a falling tree. Trams were suspended in the Belgian capital for several hours and the city’s major parks closed for fear of falling trees.

Overhead power lines supplying trains were damaged and trees brought crashing on to tracks, causing severe delays for thousands of commuters. Driving conditions in parts of Scotland were described by the Met Office as extremely hazardous, with motorists advised to stay off the roads because of blustery winds, heavy snow and icy conditions. Thousands of homes in the east of England were also left without power.

Photograph: Courtesy of CBS Dylan Farrow has denied that she was “brainwashed” or “coached” into accusing her father Woody Allen of sexual assault, in her first televised interview about the allegations. In the interview on CBS This Morning, Farrow detailed her version of the events of 4 August 1992, when she alleges Allen assaulted her as a 7-year-old, and denied that her mother had influenced her. “What I don’t understand is how is this crazy story of me being brainwashed and coached more believable than what I’m saying about being sexually assaulted by my father?” she said. Farrow described Allen touching “my labia and my vulva with his finger”. She told interviewer Gayle King that her mother was out shopping when the assault occurred. “I was taken to a small attic crawl space in my mother’s country house in Connecticut by my father. He instructed me to lay down on my stomach and play with my brother’s toy train that was set up” she said. “And he sat behind me in the doorway, and as I played with the toy train, I was sexually assaulted … As a 7-year-old I would say, I would have said he touched my private parts.” CBS This Morning ❄️ (@CBSThisMorning) “What I don't understand is how is this crazy story of me being brainwashed and coached more believable than what I'm saying about being sexually assaulted by my father?” -- @realdylanfarrow #FarrowThisMorning pic.twitter.com/eNbQyXOVv1 January 18, 2018 CBS News spoke to the Connecticut state prosecutor on the case, Frank Maco, who said that “there was no manipulation by Mia Farrow.” At the time, Maco said there was “probable cause” to charge Allen but did not want to cause Dylan distress with a trial. Allen denied the allegations again, having provided CBS News with a new statement. “Even though the Farrow family is cynically using the opportunity afforded by the Time’s Up movement to repeat this discredited allegation, that doesn’t make it any more true today than it was in the past,” it read. “I never molested my daughter – as all investigations concluded a quarter of a century ago.” Topics Film Mia Farrow news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most viewed Books Music TV & radio Art & design Film Games Classical Stage back to top become a supporter make a contribution securedrop ask for help advertise with us work for us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy digital newspaper archive all topics all contributors Facebook Twitter © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Mauro Vombe/AFP/Getty Zimbabwe’s president Emmerson Mnangagwa has announced that elections will be held within “four to five months”, the first since the end of Robert Mugabe’s 37-year rule last year. Mnangagwa, who was sworn in after Mugabe was forced to resign following a military takeover in November, also reaffirmed a pledge that the elections would be “free, credible, fair and indisputable”. “Zimbabwe is going for elections in four to five months’ time and we have to preach peace, peace and peace,” the new president, who served as Mugabe’s right hand man for decades before taking power, said during a visit to neighbouring Mozambique. Successive polls have been marred by violence and intimidation, leading to sanctions and the diplomatic isolation of the former British colony. The vote is being seen as a key test of Mnangagwa’s democratic credentials and it is crucial to unlocking badly needed financial assistance from international financial institutions as well as repairing relations with western powers. “We will ensure that Zimbabwe delivers free, credible, fair and indisputable elections to ensure Zimbabwe engages the world as a qualified democratic state,” Mnangagwa was quoted as saying by the Herald, a government-run newspaper. Under the constitution, Zimbabwe should hold elections between 22 July and 22 August, but parliament can elect to dissolve itself, triggering an early vote. The ruling Zanu-PF party holds a two-thirds majority in parliament. The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has said the UK could take steps to stabilise Zimbabwe’s currency system and extend a loan to help it clear World Bank and African Development Bank debts, but such support depended on “democratic progress”. Last week Zimbabwe’s electoral commission announced a month-long extension to its voter registration exercise, saying that only 5 million of the anticipated 7 million people had registered under a new biometric systemdesigned to reduce fraud. Though Mnangagwa was reported to have told a meeting of leaders of the Zanu-PF party that he was committed to reforms, many observers are unsure the former spy chief has either the desire or ability to compel the party to forgo the tactics of intimidation and violence that have contributed so significantly to its grip on power. Reforming Zimbabwe’s powerful security agencies will not be straightforward either. Campaigners have highlighted the case of a 45-year-old charged with undermining the authority of the president, after waving placards accusing Manangagwa and the powerful army chief, Constantino Chiwenga, of corruption and calling for the forthcoming elections to be to be monitored by the UN. Analysts say Zanu-PF is the clear favourite in the elections, and would be likely to win even without employing the underhand tactics that have previously guaranteed victory. Manangagwa, 73, will benefit from a strong wave of optimism generated by the end of Mugabe’s rule and the very public marginalisation of the deeply unpopular G40 faction close to the veteran autocrat’s wife, Grace. Zanu-PF will also gain from the weakness of the main opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change, which has been racked by internal disputes since it was disclosed that its leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, is seriously ill. Jonathan Moyo, a prominent member of the G40, has accused the new leaders of Zimbabwe of being afraid of elections. “They do not want to have free and fair elections let alone credible elections,” said Moyo, who was interviewed by the BBC in an undisclosed location outside Zimbabwe.

Photograph: AFP/Getty Images Consumers in Japan, China and South Korea should be wary of buying seafood until governments in the region have monitored and released details about the toxic impact of the Sanchi oil spill, scientists have warned. The worst oil ship disaster in decades has so far produced two visible plumes covering almost 100 square kilometres on the surface of the East China Sea, but maritime disaster experts say this is just the tip of the iceberg and millions of fish are likely to have been contaminated by carcinogens. East China Sea oil tanker disaster: what it means for the environment Read more The Iranian tanker was carrying about 136,000 tonnes (a million barrels) of light oil when it collided with a freighter on 6 June. All 32 crew are thought to have died in the blast, which sent billows of smoke into the sky and fire across the nearby ocean. The wreck then reportedly drifted from Chinese waters into the Japanese exclusive economic zone, where it finally sank on Monday. The extent of the pollution is unclear because light oil does not form a black slick (which is more likely to have come from the heavier oil from the ship’s fuel tanks). It is less visible and more soluble, which means it has a greater impact below the surface. The State Oceanic Administration said in its statement late on Wednesday it had collected water samples from 19 spill sites, and found water from five sites had petroleum substances at levels exceeding standards. Edward Overton, an environmental science professor at Louisiana State University downplayed concerns. “A light distillate or oil will readily evaporate and leave minimal residues,” he said. “Much of this oil is burning so will not cause significant environmental damage.” Other scientists fear dangerous amounts may still be leaking from the sunken wreck – where the oil cannot evaporate or burn – and poisoning fisheries of supply mackerel, croaker, cuttlefish, herring, shrimp and crabs. China and Japan have been criticised for being slow to assess the environmental impact, prompting speculation that their maritime border dispute may have complicated the response. Chinese scientists have said they lack monitoring buoys – which have previously been the subject of suspicion between the two sides. Richard Steiner, a marine scientist and retired University of Alaska professor who helped the United Nations to draw up guidelines for oil spill assessments, urged Beijing and Tokyo to begin an impact assessment two days after the initial collision. Current markers and satellite buoys would have indicated the direction of the toxic plume which could have travelled more than 200 miles with just a one-knot per hour current since 6 January. He was pleased China is planning to use remotely operated underwater vehicles to inspect the wreckage, but said such actions were tardy. “I find fault with both governments for not acting immediately,” he said and urged both nations to close fisheries until consumers can be sure that seafood from the area is safe. Based on simulations, the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton predicts the plume could reach Japan within a month. Other reports have suggested it could also reach South Korea’s Jeju Island. Although it will be steadily dispersed, oceanographers urged shoppers to be cautious until it is clear the leak has stopped. “Until there is a clear steer on monitoring, I wouldn’t touch any fish that might have passed through this area because it might be contaminated,” said Simon Boxall of the University of Southampton. “China and Japan need to sit down together, recognise they have a problem and put public safety first.” Steiner echoed this, saying international cooperation was crucial when dealing with previous spills and would be necessary to minimise future impacts. He said all the countries in the region should put in place protocols on maritime traffic, disaster response and environmental assessments “Japan, China and South Korea need to cooperate to prevent this happening again.” Topics Oil spills Oil China Asia Pacific Energy Marine life Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed Environment Climate change Wildlife Energy Pollution back to top become a supporter make a contribution securedrop ask for help advertise with us work for us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy digital newspaper archive all topics all contributors Facebook Twitter © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Sascha Steinbach/EPA Leading Social Democrats in Germany are engaged in a fierce battle of wills ahead of a crunch vote on Sunday over whether to endorse in-depth coalition negotiations with Angela Merkel’s conservatives. The party has become the focal point of a tense political drama almost four months after an inconclusive election left Germany in a state of limbo. If delegates at a special conference on Sunday vote against a grand coalition, Germany will be heading either for new elections or a minority government, neither of which is a popular choice and will leave Merkel’s political future hanging by a thread. Martin Schulz, the SPD’s embattled leader, has been criss-crossing the country this week in an effort to secure party members’ backing for a deal. He said on Wednesday it was difficult to tell whether he had the support of enough delegates. Schulz said he was encouraged by signs that members had been “drawn together through our exchanges rather than torn apart” before the conference in Bonn. But the SPD faithful are riven over the issue, with some arguing that to enter into another grand coalition, or “GroKo”, with Merkel’s conservative alliance could further damage the party’s popularity and possibly even lead to its disintegration. The rise of the rightwing populist and anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) looms large in the debate. Some in the SPD say that by siding with Merkel, the party would ease the way for the AfD – which entered the Bundestag for the first time in September – to become the largest opposition force in parliament. Sigmar Gabriel, the party’s former leader and now the foreign minister, said the world was looking to Germany to find a swift solution. “It is no exaggeration: this coming Sunday it’s not only Europe that is looking spellbound at the SPD party conference, but many people far further afield. The world will be watching Bonn for real on Sunday,” he said. The looming decision has plunged Germany’s oldest political party into nothing less than an existential crisis. Leading the opposition to a coalition is the party’s youth wing, the Jusos (Young Socialists), who have coined the phrase “NoGroKo” to sum up their campaign against what they say would be nothing short of a betrayal of social democratic values. Schulz has concentrated his campaigning efforts on Germany’s largest state, North Rhine-Westphalia, home to about a quarter of the 600 delegates due in Bonn. The state’s SPD faction – unlike others elsewhere in Germany – has declined to publicly position itself ahead of the vote. Leaving a meeting of party delegates in a Düsseldorf hotel on Tuesday, Schulz was greeted by Jusos members’ angry cries of “Nie, nie, nie wieder Gro Ko” (Never, never, never again GroKo). Kevin Kühnert, the head of Jusos, has emerged as a political star and is regarded as the biggest danger to Merkel, having rallied the party base and won considerable support for his cause. The 28-year-old politics student from Berlin has called the mood among the party’s base “devastating”. Kühnert has said he did not join the SPD “in order to see it repeatedly bang its head against the same brick wall”. Young members of the party, he has argued, “have an interest in seeing that something of this joint remains, damn it.” The party’s restoration as a leading political force in Germany “will either take place outside a grand coalition or it won’t happen at all,” he has said. The party’s leadership, including Andreas Nahles, the chair of the SPD parliamentary group and a former Jusos head, have been rattled by the passion shown by the Jusos members and by opinion polls showing the party has slipped to 18.5% – one of its lowest ratings – after it agreed last week on a 28-page prototype coalition action plan. Internal critics say the blueprint bears little resemblance to the party’s ideals. Sticking points include health, pensions and education. Even if SPD delegates vote in favour of a coalition, the drama will be far from over. More serious talks between the SPD and the conservatives could begin immediately and would be expected to last around two weeks. but Schulz would then insist on putting the final agreement to the party’s 450,000 members in a postal vote, which could take a further three weeks.

Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian The city government in Delhi has announced it will install CCTV cameras in every classroom in the capital and give parents access to the feed through a mobile phone app. The plan comes after several high-profile crimes at schools in and around the city, including the alleged rape of a five-year-old girl by a member of staff in September and the murder of a seven-year-old boy at a private school in Gurgaon during the same month. Delhi’s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, said on Wednesday that the monitoring system would “make the whole system transparent and accountable [and] ensure safety of kids”. Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) Reviewed the progress of installation of CCTV cameras in each class in all govt schools. Each parent will be given access to see his child studying in class on realtime basis on his phone. This will make the whole system transparent and accountable. It will ensure safety of kids January 17, 2018 The plan to install the cameras was initiated in September 2015 but the addition of real-time monitoring was made public this week. The cameras will be in all the region’s approximately 1,000 schools within three months. The app is understood to still be in development but will include a complaint feature. “If parents spot anything wrong and want to complain, then they can use the app to register it. The issue will be addressed by officials from the department concerned,” an education department official told the Hindustan Times. “It’s a good thing. We have to know what our children are doing there all day,” said Uma Thakur, whose daughter, five, is in year 2. “There are rape cases, murders. These things are happening in schools everywhere. Every parent is worried.” Shalu Verma, whose son is in year 6, said the cameras would help him to see “whether teachers are teaching the students or busy doing their own personal work”. “We will know … how much attention they are giving students, and also whether students are paying attention.” He could also monitor whether classrooms were being cleaned and if students were receiving the midday meal on time, he added. But Apar Gupta, a lawyer who was involved in a recent supreme court case that established a right to privacy in India, said the impact of CCTV cameras on public safety was still unclear. “They give a sense of security but it’s misplaced because they don’t really work,” he said. “Most of the studies are inconclusive.” He said the government needed to establish that the “indiscriminate” use of surveillance in public schools was necessary and proportionate, more difficult in this case given “the people who will be under perpetual surveillance will be children”. The Delhi administration ran for office on a campaign to increase safety in the region in part by installing thousands of CCTV cameras in public spaces and on buses, but has made little progress so far. Delhi’s education minister, Manish Sisodia, has said the system would also help the government investigate claims of teacher misconduct or absenteeism. Teachers going missing but continuing to collect their government salaries is thought to be endemic across Indian state schools, though a recent study found the scale of the problem might be exaggerated. Ajay Veer Yadav, general secretary of the Government School Teachers’ Association, said he totally disagreed with the idea of cameras. “More than 70% of teachers are women,” he said. “Why do they want to put CCTV cameras on them and put this in the public domain? “There is no way this is going to increase the safety of students. It is to keep a vigil on teachers – to find out why performances are not going up.” Students would be better served by tackling the shortfall of 30,000 teachers in the public system, he added.

Photograph: Michael Boyd More than 4,000 years ago builders carved out the entire surface of a naturally pyramid-shaped promontory on the Greek island of Keros. They shaped it into terraces covered with 1,000 tonnes of specially imported gleaming white stone to give it the appearance of a giant stepped pyramid rising from the Aegean: the most imposing manmade structure in all the Cyclades archipelago. But beneath the surface of the terraces lay undiscovered feats of engineering and craftsmanship to rival the structure’s impressive exterior. Archaeologists from three different countries involved in an ongoing excavation have found evidence of a complex of drainage tunnels – constructed 1,000 years before the famous indoor plumbing of the Minoan palace of Knossos on Crete – and traces of sophisticated metalworking. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The entrance staircase from above: the sea level was much lower in the early bronze age Photograph: Michael Boyd The Dhaskalio promontory is a tiny island as the result of rising sea levels, but 4,500 years ago was attached by a narrow causeway to Keros, now uninhabited and a protected site. In the third millennium BC Keros was a major sanctuary where complex rituals were enacted. Earlier excavations by the team from the University of Cambridge, the Ephorate of Antiquities of Cyclades and the Cyprus Institute have uncovered thousands of marble Cycladic sculptures – the stylised human figures which inspired western artists, including Pablo Picasso – and which appear to have been deliberately broken elsewhere and brought to the island for burial. Maintaining as well as constructing the settlement would have taken a huge communal effort. The now-deserted slopes of Dhaskalio were once covered with structures and buildings, suggesting that 4,500 years ago it was one of the most densely populated parts of the islands – despite the fact that it could not have been self-sufficient, meaning that most food, like the stone and the ore for metal working, had to be imported. The first evidence of metal-working was found in excavations 10 years ago. The new finds have uncovered two workshops full of metalworking debris, and objects including a lead axe, a mould for copper daggers and dozens of ceramic fragments from metalworking equipment including the mouth of a bellows. Archaeologists will return to excavate an intact clay oven, found at the very end of the last season. Joint director of the excavation Michael Boyd, of the University of Cambridge, said metalworking expertise was evidently concentrated at Dhaskalio at a time when access to both skills and raw materials was very limited. “What we are seeing here with the metalworking and in other ways is the beginnings of urbanisation,” he said. Far-flung communities were drawn into networks centred on the site, craft and agricultural production was intensified, and the architecture became grander, gradually overshadowing the original importance of the sanctuary. Excavated soil reveals food traces including pulses, grapes, olives, figs and almonds, and cereals, including wheat and barley. Evi Margaritis of the Cyprus Institute said: “Much of this food was imported: in the light of this evidence we need to reconsider what we know about existing networks to include food exchange.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest A researcher holds a mould for making a spearhead from molten copper. Photograph: Michael Boyd The pyramid of terraces would have blazed in the Greek sun, visible from far off, covered in white stone imported from Naxos 10 kilometres away. The complex of drainage tunnels was discovered when archaeologists were excavating an imposing staircase in the lower terraces: research continues to discover whether they were for fresh water or sewage. Lord Renfrew, joint director of the excavation, former Disney professor of archaeology at Cambridge and now the senior fellow at the McDonald Institute for archaeological research, first landed on Keros as a student and has returned often throughout his long career. He believes the promontory may originally have become a focus for development because it guarded the best natural harbour on the island, with wide views across the Aegean. The excavations are being recorded digitally, using the iDig programme running on iPads for the first time in the Aegean. This creates three-dimensional models using photogrammetry recording of the entire digging process, giving everyone involved access to all data in real time.

Photograph: Amy Sancetta/AP North and South Korea have confirmed they are to field a joint women’s ice hockey team and will march under a pro-unification flag at next month’s Winter Olympics, in the clearest sign yet of a thaw in tensions between the two countries. The two sides are to present their plan for a “peace games” to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) at the weekend, following three days of talks in the border village of Panmunjom. The South Korean unification ministry said the two countries had also exchanged opinions on the size of the North Korean team, joint cultural events and the possible use of the Masikryong ski resort in North Korea. North Korea also offered to send 230 members of its all-female cheerleading squad to the Games in Pyeongchang, which open on 9 February. Reports said the delegation would probably walk across the demilitarised zone, the heavily armed border separating the two Koreas, in a highly symbolic move. Arrangements for North Korean athletes to compete in Pyeongchang have been made at breakneck speed since the start of the year, when North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, offered to send a delegation to the Games. Facebook Twitter Pinterest South Korean delegates in Seoul before leaving for Panmunjom to attend talks on the North’s participation in the Winter Olympics. Photograph: Yonhap/EPA “Inter-Korean relations have been strained for almost 10 years,” the North’s chief delegate, Jon Jong-su, said as the Panmunjom meeting started. “We hope that ties can open,” he added. Three officials from each side took part in the talks and the results will be discussed by both Koreas with the IOC in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Saturday. “This will then enable the IOC to carefully evaluate the consequences and the potential impact on the Olympic Games and the Olympic competitions,” an IOC spokesperson said. “There are many considerations with regard to the impact of these proposals on the other participating NOCs [national Olympic committees] and athletes.” Pyongyang and Seoul must work out how the North Korean delegation – which could comprise up to 500 athletes, cheerleaders, musicians, officials and journalists – will cross the border into South Korea, and who will pay for their accommodation and other costs. South Korea is under pressure not to agree to any proposals that could violate sanctions against the North, particularly if the delegation includes senior government officials blacklisted by UN security council measures agreed in response to Pyongyang’s ballistic missile and nuclear tests. The two Koreas have previously sent joint teams to major international sports events twice, both in 1991. One event was the world table tennis championships in Chiba, Japan, and the other was soccer’s World Youth Championship in Portugal. During an era of detente in the 2000s, their athletes marched together during the opening and closing ceremonies of nine international sporting events, including the Olympics and Asian Games, but they failed to produce a joint team. The current mood of reconciliation began after the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said in a new year’s speech that he was willing to send a delegation to the Games. Critics have said Kim’s overture is an attempt to use improved ties with South Korea to weaken US-led international sanctions on North Korea while buying time to perfect his nuclear weapons programme.

Photograph: Jason Lee/Reuters Chinese surveillance chiefs are testing a facial-recognition system that alerts authorities when targets stray more than 300 metres from their home or workplace, as part of a surveillance push that critics say has transformed the country’s western fringes into a high-tech police state. Authorities in Xinjiang, a border region that is home to China’s largely Muslim Uighur minority, have been experimenting with the “alert project” since early 2017, according to Bloomberg. The programme, which matches faces caught on surveillance cameras to a watchlist of suspects, is the work of a state-run defence contractor that is developing software designed to help predict and thwart terrorist attacks before they occur. “A system like this is obviously well-suited to controlling people,” Jim Harper, a counter-terrorism specialist and former US homeland security official was quoted as saying. “‘Papers, please’ was the symbol of living under tyranny in the past. Now, government officials don’t need to ask.” The Bloomberg report is the latest to detail the cutting-edge techniques being rolled out as Xinjiang becomes a real-life laboratory for surveillance. Other methods include the harvesting of biometric data, smartphone scanners, voice analysis and compulsory satellite-tracking systems for vehicles. “They are combining all of these things to create, essentially, a total police state,” said William Nee, a China campaigner at Amnesty International. No journalist’s visit to Xinjiang now goes unnoticed. An Associated Press correspondent was stopped by police during a recent visit and told his movements were being remotely tracked with surveillance footage. During a 12-day tour of China’s “total surveillance state”, the Wall Street Journal’s vehicle was hemmed in by police after cameras spotted its out-of-town number plates. In China's far west the 'perfect police state' is emerging Read more When the Guardian visited Xinjiang last spring its journalists were summoned to meet police within minutes of checking in to a Kashgar hotel and told that reporting was forbidden without official permission. One exasperated local said Xinjiang had become hell: “I would prefer to be a Syrian refugee than Chinese.” Yang Shu, a terrorism expert at Lanzhou University, said Xinjiang’s dire security situation was an open secret and surveillance could provide “powerful clues” to help catch those causing the violence. “High technology can guarantee security without interrupting people’s normal activities,” Yang said. Beijing argues such controls are necessary given repeated eruptions of violence, which authorities blame on Islamic extremists but which activists believe are partly driven by repression of the Uighurs. Nee said reports that Islamic State had recruited some Uighurs meant some surveillance was justified: “China does face a real threat from terrorism with all of the people who have gone to Syria and could, potentially, come back.” However, the indiscriminate targeting of Uighurs was fuelling “incredible anger” and happening outside the boundaries of international or Chinese law. “People should really pay attention to this because they could easily use the same tools of surveillance elsewhere in China, or for export. A lot of these companies will naturally want to grow their businesses and sell this technology to other authoritarian countries, or even democracies, that are looking for the same tools of control.” Additional reporting by Wang Xueying Topics China Surveillance Xinjiang Asia Pacific news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story Tibetan activist put on trial in China for inciting separatism Protester who appeared in New York Times video pleads not guilty during four-hour trial, with verdict to be delivered later Published: 4 Jan 2018 Tibetan activist put on trial in China for inciting separatism Chinese activist Jiang Tianyong's subversion trial dismissed as sham Rights campaigners reject reported ‘admission of guilt’ by lawyer accused of trying to topple China’s one-party state Published: 22 Aug 2017 Chinese activist Jiang Tianyong's subversion trial dismissed as sham Chinese student abused for praising 'fresh air of free speech' in US Nationalists in China seize on remarks by Yang Shuping, accusing her of ‘demonising’ it in backlash fuelled by state-run media Published: 23 May 2017 Chinese student abused for praising 'fresh air of free speech' in US Chinese student's graduation speech in the US causes uproar at home – video A student from China’s graduation speech at a US university has drawn abuse from nationalists back home 3:20 Published: 23 May 2017 Chinese student's graduation speech in the US causes uproar at home – video China's 'war on law': victims' wives tell US Congress of torture and trauma Published: 19 May 2017 China's 'war on law': victims' wives tell US Congress of torture and trauma China puts leading human rights lawyer on trial for 'inciting subversion' Published: 8 May 2017 China puts leading human rights lawyer on trial for 'inciting subversion' China convicts rights lawyer Li Heping of 'subversion of state power' Published: 28 Apr 2017 China convicts rights lawyer Li Heping of 'subversion of state power' China says it has detained Taiwanese activist missing since 19 March Published: 29 Mar 2017 China says it has detained Taiwanese activist missing since 19 March More more on this story Most viewed World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Cities Global development back to top become a supporter make a contribution securedrop ask for help advertise with us work for us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy digital newspaper archive all topics all contributors Facebook Twitter © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The country’s short-haul airliners are set to be entirely electric by 2040. Photograph: Alamy All of Norway’s short-haul airliners should be entirely electric by 2040, the country’s airport operator said on Wednesday, cementing the Nordic nation’s role as a pioneer in the field of electric transport. Avinor, the public operator of Norwegian airports, “aims to be the first in the world” to make the switch to electric air transport, chief executive Dag Falk-Petersen said. “We think that all flights lasting up to 1.5 hours can be flown by aircraft that are entirely electric,” he said, noting that would cover all domestic flights and those to neighbouring Scandinavian capitals. EasyJet says it could be flying electric planes within a decade Read more In the near future, Avinor plans to launch a tender offer to test a commercial route flown with a small electric plane with 19 seats, starting in 2025. Norway, the largest oil and gas producer in western Europe, is paradoxically a leader in the field of electric transport. By market share, it has more electric cars on the road than any other country in the world – electric and hybrid vehicles represented more than half of new car registrations in 2017 – and also has several projects underway for electric vessels. “When we will have reached our goal, air travel will no longer be a problem for the climate, it will be a solution,” Falk-Petersen said. According to official statistics, air transport accounts for 2.4% of Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions for domestic traffic, and more than double that when international routes are included. James Dyson to invest £2.5bn on 'radically different' electric car Read more Electric air travel will also at least halve noise levels and the operating cost of aircraft, Falk-Petersen said. But before reaching that point, Avinor said it would need to use intermediary technologies, such as biofuels and hybrid fuel-electric solutions. Boeing and Airbus are currently exploring the viability of electric aircraft. After abandoning a project for 100% electric planes last year, Airbus decided to refocus its efforts on developing a hybrid model, signing a partnership with British engine maker Rolls Royce and German industrial group Siemens. The first flight is planned for 2020. Zunum Aero, a start-up partly financed by US aeronautics group Boeing, plans to bring a hybrid plane to the market by 2022. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.

Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters Donald Trump has said that Russia is helping North Korea get supplies in violation of international sanctions and that Pyongyang is getting “closer every day” to being able to deliver a long-range missile to the United States. “Russia is not helping us at all with North Korea,” Trump said during an Oval Office interview with Reuters. “What China is helping us with, Russia is denting. In other words, Russia is making up for some of what China is doing.” Steve Bannon to meet with Mueller’s investigators instead of testifying Read more With North Korea persisting as the major global challenge facing Trump this year, the president cast doubt during the 53-minute interview on whether talks with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, would be useful. In the past he has not ruled out direct talks with Kim. “I’d sit down, but I’m not sure that sitting down will solve the problem,” he said, noting that past negotiations with the North Koreans by his predecessors had failed to rein in North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. “I’m not sure that talks will lead to anything meaningful. They’ve talked for 25 years and they’ve taken advantage of our presidents, of our previous presidents,” he said. He declined to comment when asked whether he had engaged in any communications at all with Kim, with whom he has exchanged insults and threats, heightening tensions in the region. Quick guide Are US defences strong enough to ward off North Korean missiles? Show Hide What kind of anti-missile defences does the US possess? The US has various anti-missile options, some designed to take down missiles at short-range and others for medium-to-long-range. The US relies heavily on the US Patriot missile and the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence (THAAD). The US deployed THAAD to South Korea this year to defend against medium-range missiles. There is a three-phased defence system: ground-based missiles on the Korean peninsula; US naval ships stationed in the Pacific; and two bases in Alaska and California that can launch an estimated 36 interceptors. Is the US system robust enough to stop a North Korean missile attack? No air defence system offers anything like a complete guarantee of success. The Pentagon offer repeated assurances that air defence systems would be more than a match for any North Korean attack. But when missile defence systems have been put to the test over the last few decades, the performance has been far from reassuring. The US provided anti-missile defence systems to Israel and Saudi Arabia during the First Gulf War as protection against Iraq's Scud missiles. It was initially claimed that they had shot down 41 of 42 missiles fired by Iraq. But eventually it was acknowledged that only a few missiles had been hit. Recent tests of interceptors have provided little comfort – with success rates of around 50% on average. The Pentagon celebrated in May when it destroyed a mock warhead over the Pacific but overall the performance has been spotty. Since the newest intercept system was introduced in 2004 only four of nine intercept attempts have been successful. Of the five tests since 2010, only two have been successful. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. Trump said he hoped the standoff with Pyongyang could be resolved “in a peaceful way, but it’s very possible that it can’t”. Trump praised China for its efforts to restrict oil and coal supplies to North Korea but said Beijing could do much more to help constrain Pyongyang. But he said Russia appears to be filling in the gaps left by the Chinese. Western European security sources told Reuters in late December that Russian tankers had supplied fuel to North Korea on at least three occasions in recent months by transferring cargoes at sea in violation of international sanctions. Russia has denied breaching North Korea sanctions. North Korea relies on imported fuel to keep its struggling economy functioning. It also requires oil for its intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear program. Trump has repeatedly blamed a US investigation into whether Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election for hindering an improvement in US-Russian relations. “He can do a lot,” Trump said of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. “But unfortunately we don’t have much of a relationship with Russia, and in some cases it’s probable that what China takes back, Russia gives. So the net result is not as good as it could be.” Trump, who has grappled with nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches by North Korea since he took office a year ago, said Pyongyang is steadily advancing in being able to deliver a missile to the United States. “They’re not there yet, but they’re close. And they get closer every day,” said Trump. Ignore North Korea’s bombast. Its actions tell a more hopeful story | Mary Dejevsky Read more North Korea said after its last intercontinental ballistic missile launch in November that the test had put the US mainland within range. Some experts agreed that based on the missile’s trajectory and distance it had the capability to fly as far as Washington DC. They said, however, that North Korea had not yet offered any proof that it had mastered all technical hurdles, including development of a re-entry vehicle needed to deliver a heavy nuclear warhead reliably atop an ICBM, but it was likely that it soon would. Pyongyang could reach that milestone by the end of the year, some intelligence officials said. Trump disputes report he has 'very good relationship' with Kim Jong-un Read more Trump said he welcomed talks between North and South Korea over the Winter Olympics to be held in the South next month and said this could be an initial phase in helping defuse the crisis. He would not say whether the United States has been considering a limited, pre-emptive attack to show the North that the United States means business. “We’re playing a very, very hard game of poker and you don’t want to reveal your hand,” he said.

Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images At least five buses used to transport Apple employees to the company’s headquarters have had their windows smashed by what is suspected to be pellet guns during the last week. The first window was shattered on the evening of Friday 12 January, as the shuttle bus travelled from the company campus back into San Francisco. Three more were hit on Tuesday morning, followed by another suspected attack on Tuesday evening, according to an email sent to Apple staff and seen by the Guardian. “There is nothing confirmed but it is suspected that a pellet gun might have been used in these incidents,” stated the email to all employees. “Luckily, no one seems to have been injured yet.” Tech's terrible year: how the world turned on Silicon Valley in 2017 Read more California highway patrol public information officer Art Montiel confirmed the incidents. “We received several reports of charter buses being damaged while driving on the I-280, but we’re not sure what caused the damage. We’re not ruling anything out,” he told the Guardian. Montiel said that he could not be sure that the attack was targeted at Apple as the buses are unmarked. “It could be Google, Apple or any other company,” he said. However, the buses of each of the tech firms are a distinct colour: Google’s are white, Apple’s are silver and Facebook’s are blue. Montiel said he had received no reports that other company buses or private vehicles had been targeted. Apple told staff that its commuter buses would be diverted away from the I-280 highway until further notice. Montiel did not believe this strategy would be effective. “If someone was targeting the buses I’m sure they are going to find them anywhere they go. It’s not like they are hidden.” This is not the first time that the corporate buses that ship workers from the city to Silicon Valley have been targeted. In 2013 a window was smashed on a Google bus in Oakland, across the San Francisco Bay. The following year, protesters blocked buses and brandished banners to express their discontent over the privatisation of the Bay Area’s transport system. The buses have become symbols of gentrification and the perception that the tech sector is responsible for pushing up housing prices in the city, making it unaffordable for those without six-figure salaries. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The shoes, which feature the same camouflage pattern used on the city’s train seats, double up as an annual transit pass. It’s embedded in the tongues of the trainers, which are styled as a fabric version of the BVG annual ticket, and can be used just like a regular ticket covering the bus, tram and underground in zones A and B. While the cheapest annual ticket available from the BVG is currently €728, the shoes cost just €180. As a result, the sale has drawn an unusual mix of trainer collectors and those simply looking to make a saving on their daily commute. “We often see people camping outside for new shoes but this is different,” says Kalitta. “It’s not just the ‘sneakerheads’.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Shoppers queue outside Overkill in Berlin to get their hands on the limited edition trainers. Photograph: Holly Young for the Guardian Mihai Vătafu, 28, A graphic designer originally from Bucharest, has been camping in the bus stop across from the shop since Sunday. “I fell in love with the city when I moved here six months ago and I’ve always loved the trains,” says Vătafu. “Wearing the shoes will be a statement; it doesn’t matter where you are from, they represent how you feel about the city. Plus I can’t wait for the moment a ticket inspector gets on the train and I can just point to my shoes.” But Jana Sträter, 20-year-old student, sees them as practical. “I’m not a big Adidas fan, but I think the idea of getting a ticket for the train is really cool,” says Sträter. “Some people will sell them on but I will wear them.” Riders will need to wear both shoes, rather than carrying them in a bag or giving one to a friend, to use the ticket. The collaboration between a transport company and sportswear company is unusual, but the BVG saw it as a way of encouraging ridership. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mihai Vătafu braved the cold for a box of the new trainers. Photograph: Holly Young “The motivation behind the collaboration is really to get young people on to public transport,” says Petra Reetz, who says at first she was skeptical of the idea. “I said, ‘We are a public transport system, not Michael Jordan’ ... But in a big city like Berlin, the quality of life and quality of the air are important. We wanted to tell young people public transport is cool – you don’t need to buy a car.” It’s also an attempt to modernise the image of BVG, which although attracting more than 1 billion rides last year, is ageing (it turns 90 this year). The visual lynchpin of the rebranding is the camouflage design, which has also been spun into a range of merchandise including baby bibs, swimming shorts and teapots. The agency has also taken an irreverent tone on social media, including a tweet encouraging Donald Trump to become a Berlin bus driver rather than run for president. Weil wir dich lieben (@BVG_Kampagne) Okay, einen Nachteil gibt es: Eine Mauer darfst du hier nicht bauen. pic.twitter.com/UxXwu3mqTP January 20, 2017 The collaboration is also about repositioning the BVG as central to the brand of the city itself. “We Berliners, we are like Londoners – we know we are cool,” says Reetz. “And now we are very cool because we have our own sneakers.” Despite being sleep deprived, and having waited in both the snow and the rain, Vătafu is delighted to get his hands on the trainers. “I’m too excited to be tired,” he says. Now he’s heading home to sleep and keep the shoes safely out of the rain. “After that maybe all of us with the shoes will organise a night out riding the trains for free,” he laughs.

Photograph: Alba Vigaray/EPA It takes all of 30 seconds for the doorman at Trump Place to kick me out of the building. “Ma’am, you need to leave,” he says, when I tell him I am a journalist. Then he practically shoves me out the marble lobby, back through the revolving doors . Tensions are high at Trump Place, 200 Riverside Boulevard. The luxury condominium complex on New York’s Upper West Side is currently embroiled in an increasingly contentious legal battle with the Trump family. Like many of the towers bearing the Trump brand, 200 Riverside Boulevard isn’t actually owned by the Trumps; it simply licenses the name, which is plastered on the building in big brass letters. And now many residents don’t want it any more. Audrey Nelson lives with her boyfriend in Trump Place. Speaking to me on the street outside, she explains that the condo board surveyed residents about the Trump branding following the 2016 election. “Most people want to get rid of it,” she says. But DJT Holdings, a company largely owned by Donald Trump, got wind of this and was threatening the building with legal action. “I don’t think we’re supposed to talk about it,” says another resident, eyeing me suspiciously. Plastering the Trump brand – which can cost tens of millions of dollars to lease – on your luxury hotel or apartment complex once added a veneer of prestige and upped profitability; Trump used to boast it would increase a property’s value by 25%. Licensing his name certainly seems to have increased his personal fortune. A financial summary Trump issued when he kicked off his presidential campaign in 2015 valued his “real estate licensing deal, brand and branded developments” at $3.3bn – the most significant single source of what Trump then claimed to be an $8.7bn total net worth. While these numbers are impossible to verify and have been the subject of much debate, it is unambiguous that the Trump brand has traditionally been a source of considerable value. That may no longer be the case. Trump brand graphic Since the Donald embarked upon his political career his surname appears to have become a liability. Speaking to me over the phone, previous 200 Riverside Boulevard tenants told me that Trump’s foray into politics has been disastrous for property prices. Harvey and Peggy Koeppel put their apartment on the market just before the 2016 election. “It sat there for months,” Harvey Koeppel says, until they were forced to “accept 10% less than their asking price”. It’s not just the Koeppels who have seen the value of their Trump-associated property fall. According to a recent report by CityRealty, a real estate listings and research service, prices in the 11 Trump-branded condo buildings in Manhattan dropped below the borough average for the first time ever at the end of 2017. While the average price per square foot for all Manhattan condos fell by 1%, the price per square foot for condos in Trump buildings fell 7% in the 12 months to November 2017. “Any building that chooses to end its association with the Trump brand is likely motivated by financial reasons … [and] no doubt greatly influenced by beliefs about how the brand affects the building’s bottom line,” says Gabby Warshawer, director of research for CityRealty. All of which, she says, raises “questions about the viability of the Trump brand”. Indeed, just down the road from where I’m standing, three other apartment buildings were also once known as Trump Place. Just eight days after the 2016 election, the rental buildings rebranded as 140, 160 and 180 Riverside Boulevard, after hundreds of the building’s residents petitioned the owner, Equity Residential, to “dump the Trump name”. The brand no longer signified premium, but prejudice, said residents: it had become an embarrassment. (The Trump Organization declined multiple times to contribute to this story.) More recently, a hybrid hotel and condo building in downtown Manhattan also disassociated itself from the president, rebranding from Trump SoHo to the Dominick last December. The building’s owners bought out the Trump Organization’s management contract following unrelenting bad press and reports of low occupancy, some of which, to be fair, predated Trump’s entering the White House. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A worker carries letters spelling ‘Trump Place’ after they were removed from the 160 Riverside Place residential building in New York. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images In 2006 construction of the building was halted when human remains from an old burial ground were discovered on the site, and a construction worker died after falling 42 floors from the building in 2008. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office also opened a criminal case (which it dropped last October) against Donald Jr and Ivanka Trump, investigating them for misleading investors about the value of the SoHo hotel. With this chequered history, things still took a turn for the worse when Trump entered the White House: 11 of the 12 NBA teams that had once stayed at Trump SoHo boycotted the hotel and Koi, a high-end sushi restaurant that had once been frequented by celebrities, closed in April 2017 after seeing a slump in business that may have related to the new president. Even the Trump Organization itself seems to have realized that the family name has depreciated in value. In late 2016 Trump Hotels announced a new hotel brand aimed at millennials – called Scion. The choice of name perhaps reflected prevailing public opinion towards the Trump hotel collection. YouGov data compiled exclusively for Guardian Cities shows that high-income Americans have a dramatically lower impression of Trump-branded hotels than they do other hotel brands at the same price point. While Americans with a family income of more than $100,000 had positive impressions of the Ritz-Carlton, JW Marriott, Four Seasons, Westin and Omni hotel brands, sentiment of Trump hotels alone was overwhelmingly negative: reaching a high of -5.4 in November and a low of -17.1. (YouGov first started tracking attitudes towards Trump brands in June 2017). By comparison, impressions of Ritz-Carlton were 44.6 in November. But not everyone is pessimistic about the long-term prospects of the Trump name. “The fact that a few Trump affiliated hotels are changing brands is insignificant when you consider the same could be said of a hundred other hotel brands,” says John W O’Neill, a professor at the Center for Hospitality Real Estate Strategy at Pennsylvania State University. “Hotel owners change brands for all sorts of reasons, so it isn’t necessarily negative.” For example, it is possible that some leases may have been up for renewal. Trump brand graphic What’s more, some of Trump’s properties are booming thanks to his presidency. Trump’s DC hotel is making record profits and, according to the president’s last financial disclosure about his business assets, released last June, income from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach was around $37m, up from $30m in his May 2016 financial report. But these properties seem to be very much the exception not the rule, particularly if one looks at the state of his brand outside the US: the Trump name is being scrubbed from skylines all over the world. In the two-and-a-half years since he announced his presidential bid, his brand has come off at least seven buildings in four cities: Panama, New York, Rio, and Toronto. Trump-branded hotels in Vancouver and Chicago are also rumoured to be attempting to sever their ties. Canadians, in particular, have been very clear that they don’t want the Trump name associated with their cities. In December 2015, shortly after he called Mexicans “rapists” and criminals, Toronto councillor Josh Matlow campaigned to get the owners of what was then the Trump Tower to change the building’s name. “Toronto’s city motto is ‘diversity our strength’,” says Matlow now. “My view, along with many other Torontonians, was there no place for Trump’s name in the skyline of the world’s most diverse city.” In June 2017 the building’s owners spent millions of dollars exiting their contract with the Trump Organization and the Toronto skyline is now Trump-free. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Demonstrators outside Trump Hotel International in Washington DC in January 2017 protest President Trump’s executive order barring citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. Photograph: Zach Gibson/Getty Images Matlow concedes that “a number of ingredients” factored into the decision to remove Trump’s name, including legal battles by unhappy investors over poor management of the development itself. The final decision was likely “a combination of financial trouble – and then Donald Trump imploding his own brand due to his hateful and divisive rhetoric”. Today the only Trump-branded hotel left in Canada is in Vancouver, and there are rumoursit may not last there. Brent Toderian, Vancouver’s former chief planner, says he spoke out as soon as the name was first attached to the building, saying “that the Trump name and brand was incompatible with Vancouver’s brand”. His feelings are widely shared. Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson refused to attend the opening ceremony of the hotel last year, telling reporters at the time that Trump’s brand had “no more place on Vancouver’s skyline than his ignorant ideas have in the modern world”. The Trump name may also soon also be scrubbed from Central America. In 2015 owners of the Trump Ocean Club, a luxury apartment building in Panama City, fired Trump’s management company and removed his name from the building. The Trump name remained on the adjoining hotel, with whom the Trump Organization had a separate agreement, but there have been multiple reports that the owners are now looking to follow suit: the Trump name is hurting business. Detroit redefined: city hires America's first official 'chief storyteller' Read more Data shared with Guardian Cities shows that occupancy rates for Trump Panama in the beginning of January was around 25%, well below the 43.7% average occupancy for luxury hotels in Panama in January 2017 recorded by STR, a data and analytics specialist. “Not even the US embassy staff stay at the hotel,” says a source close to the matter who wished to remain anonymous, citing the Trump Organization’s proclivity for litigation. “We’re at the heart of the hispanic world and he’s alienated most everyone in Latin America and most of the rest of the world. The hotel unit owners are desperate.” (On Friday the US ambassador to Panama resigned, saying he could no longer serve under the Trump administration.) With so many buildings publicly cutting ties with the president, or seeking to, are we witnessing the beginning of the end of Trump’s real estate empire? One industry expert, who also wished to remain anonymous, says they doubt the Trump name has long-term viability on either residential buildings or hotels. “My instinct says [Trump] is going to end up in a bad situation and developers are going to want to distance themselves. The damage to the name is already profound and will only get worse.” There are ample signs that the longer Trump remains in DC, the less welcome his name will be in cities around the world. While the president may be “a very stable genius”, his real estate empire is beginning to look more than a little shaky.

Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty With Yemeni president Abd-rabbu Mansour Hadi still in Saudi Arabia, the return of prime minister Ahmed Obeid bin Daghr to the port of Aden at the end of December underlined the interim capital’s importance. Amid the carnage of the Yemeni civil war and with the former capital, Sana’a, under Houthi control, Aden is the only major city looking remotely open for international business. President Hadi’s hometown was one of the few ports to be reopened at the end of last year after the Saudi-led coalition opted to starve out the northern rebels. Now Aden must work out how to recover from ruinous damage sustained during the 2015 offensive, in which the Houthis came within a whisker of seizing the city. A capital only in name Parliament reconvened in Aden last August, and announced the county’s first budget since 2014 earlier this month – a step towards normality. But with an uneasy coalition in place, achieving stable governance remains very difficult, says independent journalist Mohammed al-Qalisi. “The security situation isn’t safe, because Aden is controlled by many groups: Hadi’s forces, [separatist movement] the Southern Resistance’s forces, the Salafi militias. And the government still faces many other problems, like al-Qaida and Isis.” He says the character of this city of 1.7 million people, framed against the smoky backdrop of the extinct Shamsan volcano, has changed. “It was a liberal city, with a mix of people – northerners, southerners, people of Indian origin. But the war turned everything upside-down. Now freedoms are being reduced, and it’s moved to being close-minded, which is one of the biggest problems the city, and the country, faces.” Aden in numbers 839 – the number of damaged structures in the city, according to an August 2015 assessment. 3rd – Aden’s ranking in world ports during the British colonial period, after New York and Liverpool. 1989 – the last time Aden was a capital, prior to the unification of North and South Yemen in 1990. 19m – gallons of water once held in the abandoned Tawila cisterns on the volcano, which may have been built by a pre-Islamic civilisation. 45 – the number of months the French poet Arthur Rimbaud spent living in Aden while working as a trader there in the 1880s.

Photograph: Tony Gibson/Getty Images History in 100 words Aden was possibly first referenced in print in Ezekiel 27:23, its position at the mouth of the Red Sea making it an early terminus for the western Arabian spice caravans. As it passed through the hands of various Islamic caliphates, it became a bustling global trade centre, even attracting a Chinese delegation in 1421. The collapse of Ottoman rule in the early 17th century had reduced it to a village of around 600 by the time the British snatched it from a local sultan in 1839. Topping up passing vessels heading to and from the Suez Canal with coal and water, this free port became vital to British empire logistics. The mid-1960s Aden Emergency made the building pressures of Arab nationalism abundantly clear, and it was ceded as the new capital of the republic of South Yemen on 30 November 1967. Aden in sound and vision Recent BBC and Amazon drama The Last Post is winning praise for its portrayal of a British military police unit in Aden in the final months of colonialism. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Following independence, South Yemen was a socialist stronghold – as this hour of red Yemeni marching music shows. Facebook Twitter Pinterest How liveable is Aden? Barely. With the Yemeni economy crippled, residents have few job options and remain vulnerable to inflationary price surges on food. Government salaries have gone unpaid for two years. Oil was a major employer; the Little Aden refinery once set up by BP is working again, but supply from Shabwa province to the east is still being re-established. The only surefire source of work is training as a soldier or security officer in one of the city’s many military camps. Another thing that’s corrupting the soul of Aden, says al-Qalisi: “Most people here are educated, so it’s really depressing to see doctors and teachers training in the camps.” Biggest urban risk A city where summer temperatures average in the mid- to high 30C can’t do without electricity for air conditioning, and it is proving a matter of life and death – an Aden resident was shot last May during protests over local power cuts. “People are still facing really bad days,” says al-Qalisi. According to him, the city still only gets around two hours’ power daily, either at night or early mornings. Development of the al-Haswa power station in Aden’s outskirts has stalled, and the power infrastructure is currently topped up by mobile generators supplied by the United Arab Emirates and Qatar – undoubtedly welcome, but a symptom of the geopolitical jostling going on in the country. What’s next for the city? Prior to the war, there were hopes Aden’s maritime history and strategic location might make it a candidate for a Dubai-style development supernova. Now Djibouti, on the other side of the Gulf of Aden, is rapidly usurping that future. The Dubai operator DP World actually did manage Aden’s facilities between 2008 and 2012 before pulling out amid the worsening political climate and accusations of corruption. The UAE, part of the coalition propping up President Hadi, still retains strong interests in the country and has been pouring resources into Aden’s schools, healthcare and sewage infrastructure through its Emirates Red Crescent affiliate. But al-Qalisi says the city needs to be realistic about its future: “We need 50 years to be like Dubai. Now Yemenis need the basics, like electricity and water. Until we get them, then being like Dubai is a dream.” Gaza City in the spotlight: hesitant hope in a city where everyone still wants out Read more Close zoom The popular English-language Sana’a-based paper the Yemen Times has stopped publishing, reflecting the difficult reporting climate in the country.

But what looked futuristic on paper would herald a new decay Cities is supported by About this content Lorenzo Tondo in Poggioreale Nuova @lorenzo_tondo Mon 15 Jan 2018 06.00 GMT Last modified on Mon 15 Jan 2018 11.32 GMT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Piazza Elimo in Poggioreale Nuova, Italy is now mostly deserted, its residents scattered around the world. Photograph: Umberto Santoro Fifty years ago, the ground began to shake in Poggioreale, an ancient village in the Belìce Valley of south-west Sicily. Calogero Petralia was eating spaghetti with his family, just as he did every Sunday lunch. By the time the initial earthquake and the aftershocks that night had quietened, the house where Petralia was born and raised was gone. It was 15 January 1968 and he was 18 years old. “My heart remained in that room,” he says. Measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale, the earthquake was one of the most powerful to strike Italy, killing 231 people in the valley, injuring more than 1,000 and leaving as many as 100,000 homeless. Four towns were razed entirely; Poggioreale was one of them. Instead of rebuilding the houses in their original location, however, the Italian government tried something new. It hired well-known architects such as Franco Purini to design and build entirely new cities, from scratch, on different sites. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Italian firemen and rescue workers survey the ruins of Montevago, Sicily after the Belice earthquake in January 1968. Photograph: Rolls Press/Popperfoto/Getty “Famous architects from all over Italy came to visit us,” says Petralia, now 68. “They told us how we had to build the new village. I took part in the work as a worker myself. We built hundreds of cement boxes, and one day they gave us the keys and said, ‘Here, these are your houses. This is your new town.’” The brand-new Poggioreale – known as Poggioreale Nuova – was located four kilometres from the now-destroyed original. It was built according to a strange late-60s design aesthetic, including cement buildings with colourful columns and statues inspired by ancient Greece. The heart of it was Piazza Elimo, a square based on an agora and framed by a two-storey colonnade designed by Paolo Portoghesi, also responsible for mosques in Rome and Strasbourg and the royal palace in Amman. xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> We were victims of an urban experiment, imposed on us from the top Mayor Lorenzo Pagliaroli But while it was easy enough to move the people, it proved harder to transplant centuries of history, habit and tradition. Designed as a modern city around the automobile, Poggioreale Nuova lacked the courtyards and alleys where residents of the original Poggioreale would meet. “The new Poggioreale did not belong to me,” says Calogero. “Those postmodern buildings were not part of my tradition. I felt like an immigrant, four kilometres away from my real home.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Calogero Petralia, 68, shows a picture of Poggioreale after the earthquake, which struck when he was 18. He now lives in Poggioreale Nuova. Photograph: Umberto Santoro He wasn’t alone in feeling isolated in his new surroundings. Many of the residents migrated abroad. Poggioreale Nuova was designed to accommodate 10,000 people, but whereas in 1950 it had 3,400 inhabitants, today there are only 1,400. The piazza, conceived as an open-air mall, is now mostly deserted. The homes overlooking it sell for a pittance: a 100 sq metre apartment is on the market for just €15,000. The new Poggioreale, just like the old one, has become a ghost town. “The truth is that we were victims of an urban experiment imposed on us from the top,” says the current mayor, Lorenzo Pagliaroli. “But cities cannot be rebuilt in a few years. The old Poggioreale was founded in 1642 and it took 300 years to model it, according to the habits of its people. The new Poggioreale was rebuilt in less than 15 years, without taking into account the traditions of its inhabitants. People used to live side by side and the town was full of gathering places. The neighbourhoods in the New Poggioreale were built far from each other. At the time, they didn’t need a car to go downtown or to visit a friend. Now they do.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Poggioreale Nuova is now deserted for much of the day, frequented only by stray dogs. Photograph: Umberto Santoro Certainly a lack of money was not the problem. The Italian government invested several billion euros over the years in reconstruction, but little on rebuilding those commercial activities destroyed by the quake. Grocery stores, workshops and farmhouses were destroyed, never to be rebuilt. The people had lost not only their homes but their livelihoods. “Our fathers needed work and investments to restart the economy destroyed by the earthquake,” says Pagliaroli. “The state instead gave us a modern work of art that did not belong to us.” It was the same story in other settlements. Salaparuta, which today has 1,600 citizens, had twice as many before the earthquake hit. Gibellina, meanwhile, was rebuilt 20km from the original destroyed village, on land belonging to Ignazio and Nino Salvo, two notorious Sicilian mafia affiliates. But while the ancient settlement (founded by Arabs in the late Middle Ages) was transformed by artist Alberto Burri into one of the world’s largest works of land art – the rubble superimposed by boxes of reinforced concrete to create a labyrinth – the new town remains unfinished. Local estimates put the amount of money outstanding at €380m. Although some towns held on to their inhabitants through the olive oil trade, one of the few successful industries in the valley, many settlements were bled dry. Sydney, Australia is home today to more than 5,000 citizens descended from people who left Poggioreale. “The displacement of Gibellina and Poggioreale involved only buildings and streets,” says Maurizio Carta, professor of city planning at the University of Palermo. “But the traditions and lives of its inhabitants have not moved, and remain buried beneath rubble in the old city.’’ Facebook Twitter Pinterest The ‘ghost town’ of Poggioreale is now a tourist attraction, more widely visited than the new towns that replaced them. Photograph: Andreas_Zerndl/Getty/iStockphoto Today, despite Poggioreale Nuova’s lofty vision, it is the original Poggioreale that is proving most attractive. Thousands of tourists visit the “ghost town” every year, wandering among its roofless homes, where faded newspapers and magazines from 14 January 1968 can still be found peeking out from the rubble. “The ancient Poggioreale, abandoned and forgotten, is one of the most extraordinary expressions of the concept of resilience,” says Carta. “Submerged beneath the ruins, it has waited patiently for history to revaluate it. It waited for someone to remember it, sooner or later. And that is exactly what has happened.” Abandoned airports around the world – in pictures Read more Meanwhile, it is Poggioreale Nuova that feels like the real ghost town. After dark, stray dogs roam the square, older residents who once gathered to play cards now stay indoors, and there is a notable absence of young people. Antonio Tusarolo, 36, is a potter and painter and one of the few younger people living here. “There is nothing here for young people,” he says. “The majority of my friends left to study and work somewhere else. We have no square or place to go. I wish I saw the old town before the quake. It’s sad for us not having had the chance to live in the ancient Poggioreale.” “Youth are our last hope,” says Pagliaroli. “Without them, we are destined to disappear from the face of Sicily, like our beloved town that night 50 years ago.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here Topics Cities Urban decay Earthquakes Europe Natural disasters and extreme weather Architecture features Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Photograph: Ruth Maclean for the Guardian Gold jewellery glinting, robes changing from blue to green under the lights, the diva of Timbuktu sang of Allah, salt mines and camels. Her audience sat silently around a courtyard, watching, listening, giving nothing away. Then, as she began Sourgou, her haunting Tuareg song, two men who could no longer contain their joy leapt on stage with her. They began to dance, crowns of charms around their heads, streaming turbans following their swooping movements. Khaira Arby had been away from home for a long time, but on a Tuesday last month, she brought her music back to Timbuktu, the legendary Malian city of poetry and learning that has, in recent years, been silenced by a prolonged and complex conflict. Hers was the first of a series of monthly concerts to be put on by Timbuktu Renaissance, an organisation whose mission is to bring the town’s people back together through culture. xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> We were singing about what we were going through, to transmit the message about what happened Abdulrahman Cissé Curious Timbuktiens kept arriving at the Auberge du Désert, one of the last functioning hotels in a former tourist magnet, following the sound of Arby’s voice, electric guitars, and an ngoni. Most had not known the concert was happening: its organisers had given very little advance notice for fear it would be targeted by the extremists who are still believed to have eyes and ears in Timbuktu. Soon, behind the silent sitters, there was an excited crowd. “It’s a long time since I saw anything like this,” said Agaly Dicko, a shy security guard in a “Sacramento, California” hoodie. “There’s not been anything at all since the crisis.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Singer Abdulrahman Cissé at his Timbuktu home. His band, Buktu Jazz, have found the crisis a creative time. Photograph: Ruth Maclean for the Guardian The crisis is far from over in northern Mali, though the citizens of Timbuktu hope they have suffered the worst of it already. Secessionists and Islamists linked to al-Qaida seized control of the city in 2012. The latter, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) enforced Islamic law, forcing women to cover up, flogging people for wearing perfume, and tearing down saints’ graves and a mosque door that legend had it would remain closed until the end of the world. Musicians received death threats; their instruments were burned. One Islamist arrived at a radio station that had collected decades’ worth of local music one day and carted all the tapes away in rice sacks. But some look back on it as a time of great musical creativity. “We composed a lot of music during the crisis, but inside houses, in secret,” said Abdulrahman Cissé, a mechanic and musician known locally as Adé, who did backing vocals for Arby, sitting crosslegged on a duvet laid out in a nook of his small courtyard. “We were singing about what we were going through, to transmit the message about what happened.” “It’s still your city. Even if there’s war, or fire, it’s better for you to stay in your city. Put up with the smoke in your city, soon the fresh air will come back,” he sang in Songhai, then Arabic, then Tamashek – just three of the six languages he uses.

Groups of women in lipstick and red-gold dresses pray openly at the tombs of the city’s 333 saints. Giggling teenagers tease each other in an ornate doorway, leading to the house where the German explorer Heinrich Barth once stayed. Young women in leggings, three to a motorbike, whizz round the earthen Djinguereber mosque, their hair flying. But in the region outside the city, attacks continue against the UN, military, and civilians. Four days before the concert, five workers installing fibre-optic cables were killed to the south of Timbuktu. A succession of forces has tried to wrest back control of Mali’s vast northern plains; the latest of these, the G5 Sahel, is composed of soldiers from the five countries affected by the crisis – Mali, Niger, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Chad – and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have just announced that they will contribute $150m, in addition to the $60m from the US and $59m from the EU. Timbuktu itself is not immune to attack. After the concert, armed guards stood round the carpeted courtyard where Arby sat relaxing with a cup of tea. She seemed nervous. “There are always people with bad intentions so I do feel scared, of bandits, of being kidnapped, but when I’m with the people, I feel another emotion that makes me forget the fear,” she said.

Arby’s fear of being kidnapped is very real: ransoms have made AQIM an estimated $100m, according to a new report, and the UN’s presence in Timbuktu is no guarantee of safety: last year a Swiss missionary was abducted from her home for the second time, and later appeared in an AQIM video. Given the risk, Arby has made an impressive promise: she will move back to Timbuktu if a recording studio is built there. The studio is one of the things Schneider and her fellow directors are trying to raise funds for; also in the works are a youth centre with free wifi, and a project with Ishkar, a shop selling crafts made in conflict zones, to sell embroidered scarves. When Timbuktu was full of tourists, there was plenty of work in hotels, as a tour guide, or making souvenirs to sell. Now, there is a different market for the distinctive silver crosses of Timbuktu and its skins decorated with Arabic calligraphy: the thousands of UN peacekeepers stationed by the airport.

Photograph: Ruth Maclean for the Guardian Because tourists no longer wander the town’s sandy alleyways, former tour guides are learning how to install solar panels instead, and groups of young men sit on street corners hoping to be hired as day labourers. “A toubab? In Timbuktu? Do I, myself, even exist?” Diahara Maiga, an incredulous snack-merchant, exclaimed when she saw me in the town’s medina, using the ubiquitous west African word for “foreigner”. She threw fish into a pot of spitting oil at her feet, golden baubles jangling at her temples. The morning after the concert, Adé was still humming the night’s music as he lit a cigarette and left his house for a jam with his band, Buktu Jazz. Rumours that some of the next concerts might feature Mali’s hip-hop scene brought out his old-fashioned side. “Hip-hop doesn’t work here,” he said, shaking his head and tutting. “You need to play something young and old people will like.” For Adé, Timbuktu’s music is powerful enough to begin to solve many of its problems. “What happened last night was very important,” he said. “When you do this in public, it’s a strong message. When people go home and think about this overnight, it’ll make them think of reconciling with each other.” Topics Mali World music Africa Al-Qaida features Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story Al-Qaida frees South African man held in Mali for six years Stephen McGown was kidnapped from a Timbuktu hostel in 2011 but South African government says he is back home Published: 3 Aug 2017 Al-Qaida frees South African man held in Mali for six years Swedish man kidnapped by Islamist militants in Mali released after six years Sweden says Johan Gustafsson, who was kidnapped while on a motorcycle tour, was set free ‘a few days ago’ but declined to give any details on the negotiations Published: 26 Jun 2017 Swedish man kidnapped by Islamist militants in Mali released after six years At least two dead after attack at Mali tourist resort near Bamako Malian government says ‘situation is under control’ at Le Campement resort east of capital after reports of gunshots and rising smoke Published: 18 Jun 2017 At least two dead after attack at Mali tourist resort near Bamako Mali: three UN peacekeepers die in attack by Al-Qaida affiliate Rocket and mortar fire on UN camp in north of country kills three Guinean peacekeepers and injures eight others Published: 10 Jun 2017 Mali: three UN peacekeepers die in attack by Al-Qaida affiliate Mali cancels return of famous music festival after al-Qaida attack Published: 30 Jan 2017 Mali cancels return of famous music festival after al-Qaida attack Mali suicide bomber kills at least 50 people in Gao military camp Published: 18 Jan 2017 Mali suicide bomber kills at least 50 people in Gao military camp Skilled, determined and broke: Africa's female football pioneers Published: 3 Dec 2016 Skilled, determined and broke: Africa's female football pioneers The wrong side of the fence: a Malian refugee on trying to reach Europe Published: 14 Oct 2016 The wrong side of the fence: a Malian refugee on trying to reach Europe More more on this story Most viewed World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Cities Global development back to top become a supporter make a contribution securedrop ask for help advertise with us work for us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy digital newspaper archive all topics all contributors Facebook Twitter © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA Chris Tarrant has been fined £6,000 and banned from the roads for a year after admitting drink-driving after a lunchtime pub visit. The television presenter, 71, got behind the wheel of his Mercedes on 16 December after drinking in the Bladebone Inn in Bucklebury, a mile and a half from his home in Berkshire. He pleaded guilty to the charge at Reading magistrates court on Thursday morning. Sentencing him, the district judge, Shomon Khan, said drink-driving was serious and put others at serious risk. The court heard that on the day he was caught, Tarrant had been at the Bladebone Inn from 12.30pm. He was served four drinks – brandy and port – although his counsel said they were not all drunk by Tarrant. Hasrat Ali, prosecuting, said staff and others in the pub were concerned that Tarrant had decided to drive home after 2pm. “One member of the public had noticed that Mr Tarrant had stumbled near the bar area,” she said. Police caught up with Tarrant at his home at 2.25pm, 13 minutes after being called. “Those that attended spoke to Mr Tarrant who commented that he had just drunk three glasses of wine on arrival at his home address,” Ali said. “He was asked to sign the pocket notebook to that effect but he refused.” After a breathalyser test registered 50 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath – above the 35mcg legal limit – Tarrant was taken to the police station for an interview. “He gave a different version of events in the sense that it wasn’t three glasses of wine that he had drunk, that in fact he had a large glass of brandy and a glass of wine,” Ali said. In court, Tarrant spoke only to confirm his name and to say “guilty” when the clerk read the charge. Simon Ray, defending, said: “The most important mitigation I can give is an apology through me of taking the decision to drive on that day.” After the hearing, Tarrant said he was “very sorry”. He said he had drunk “just enough to be over”, adding: “I honestly didn’t think I was over, but apparently I was, so fair enough. I made a mistake and I paid for it. I shouldn’t have driven. Full stop.” Topics Crime news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most viewed UK UK politics Education Media Society Law Scotland Wales Northern Ireland back to top become a supporter make a contribution securedrop ask for help advertise with us work for us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy digital newspaper archive all topics all contributors Facebook Twitter © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters The bride had walked down the aisle countless times before, usually pushing a trolley of drinks or reheated food. She wore a neat uniform with a name badge instead of a white dress, and probably checked the guests had fastened their seat belts before the ceremony. Love was definitely in the air when Pope Francis married two cabin crew members in an impromptu wedding on a flight taking the pontiff and his entourage between two Chilean cities. Paula Podest, 39, and Carlos Ciuffardi, 41, had been married in a civil service but their planned religious ceremony was scotched when an earthquake in 2010 almost destroyed their parish church in the Chilean capital, Santiago. Seizing an unmissable opportunity, the couple asked Francis to bless their marriage. But he had something else in mind. “Do you want me to marry you?” he asked them. “Here?” they replied, astonished. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pope Francis conducts the wedding ceremony at the front of the plane. Photograph: Osservatore Romano Press Office Handout/EPA The pope said yes and performed a brief ceremony at the front of the plane. An airline executive was the official witness and a document was signed by a Chilean bishop on board. “It was a great surprise and great joy,” said Greg Burke, the Vatican spokesman. “Everything is valid. Everything is official.” The Catholic church’s view that civil wedding ceremonies are not legitimate in the eyes of God, and therefore the couple’s two children, Rafaella, six, and Isabella, three, were born out of wedlock, appears to have been glossed over. Podest and Ciuffardi met more than 10 years ago when she was his boss as a steward for LATAM, Chile’s flagship airline. As wedding gifts, Francis gave the bride a white rosary and the groom a black one. He asked Ciuffardi if his wife was still the boss; Ciuffardi laughed and said yes. The pope told the couple: “This is what’s missing in the world, the sacrament of marriage. I hope this motivates couples to marry.” The couple said they planned to celebrate with a “tiny honeymoon” in the southern city of Iquique on Thursday night, before flying back to Santiago on Friday. In 2016, Francis published a 256-page document, Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love), which acknowledged many of the pressures on modern family life.

Photograph: Julian Smith/AAP British settlement was a “very good thing” although not “good immediately for everyone”, Tony Abbott has said. With Malcolm Turnbull in Japan meeting with his counterpart, Shinzo Abe, to discuss North Korea, security and trade, the former prime minister weighed in on the debate about moving Australia Day and praised Donald Trump’s efforts in North Korea. When asked on 2GB radio about the Greens’ renewed focus on changing the date from 26 January due to concerns it celebrates the day of British settlement and Indigenous dispossession, Abbott suggested advocates of change were “embarrassed about our country”. Celebrating Australia Day on 26 January like dancing on graves, says reconciliation body Read more Abbott accused Labor of “deafening silence on the issue”. “To the extent that any Labor party people have spoken here, they’ve tried to have a bet each way, which is so typical,” he said. On Thursday Bill Shorten said there was a “range of views” but he was “on the record as supporting Australia Day staying on January 26”. “I can respect that different people have different views,” he said. “You’re not going to see me sneering at Indigenous Australians who want to have a discussion about a different date for Australia Day.” Abbott suggested Australians needed to “be unambiguous about our country: Australia is a great country. “We must work … to make ourselves better but we don’t do that by wallowing in endless, carping self-criticism. “British settlement was a very good thing – it wasn’t good immediately for everyone. But the modern Australia that emerged from British settlement … is something that all of us, on balance, can and should be proud of. “This idea that we can rewrite history, this idea that we should never have been settled the way we were, (a) it’s unrealistic and (b) it flies in the face of our country’s historical achievement.” At a press conference in Tokyo, Turnbull said that he and Abe were “very committed” to concluding negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership when trade ministers next meet to discuss it in March.

Photograph: Eugene Hoshiko/AP At a lunch function the Australian prime minister said the TPP, which was revived in 2017, would not have been possible without Japan and Australia pushing for it to continue after Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal. Linda Burney warns Greens push to change Australia Day 'more divisive than helpful' Read more Turnbull said the TPP was likely to be a success that other countries would seek to join and was structured to allow the US to rejoin in future if it wished. Indonesia and China have already indicated a desire to join. With North Korea the focus of talks between Turnbull and Abe, the Australian prime minister dismissed suggestions that cooperation between North and South Korea on the Winter Olympics was a meaningful indicator of diplomatic success. He said the focus remained denuclearisation. “When the regime shows real movement in that direction, I think that’s where negotiations can begin in earnest,” Turnbull told reporters. “We have to maintain the economic pressure from the sanctions and not to ... accept a sort of a lull from North Korea as an indication that they are going to change their ways.” Turnbull said he agreed with the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, that the military option should remain on the table. Australia and Japan are pushing for closer defence ties and will later in 2018 sign a defence agreement that will provide a legal framework for more joint military exercises. Under the deal Japanese troops could conduct military exercises out of Darwin – almost 76 years after Japanese planes bombed the city in the second world war. Abbott said Trump had “injected a new element of firmness” into the crisis on the Korean peninsula. “As a result, we’ve seen the Chinese ratchet up the pressure on the North Koreans,” he said. “I find it a little dismaying. Instead of giving this guy credit, so many people, particularly on the left of politics, keep sneering at him.” Topics Australia Day Tony Abbott Coalition Australian politics Bill Shorten Labor party news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most viewed Australia World AU politics Environment Football Indigenous Australia Immigration Media Business Science Tech back to top become a supporter make a contribution securedrop ask for help advertise with us work for us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy digital newspaper archive all topics all contributors Facebook Twitter © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A report by Human Rights Watch has condemned leaders who court popularity with ‘dangerous rhetoric’. Photograph: Ross D Franklin/AP Rising intolerance in many western countries has created an “open field for murderous leaders” around the world, a leading human rights group has warned. In an annual report assessing more than 90 nations, Human Rights Watch warned of a “frontal assault on the values of inclusivity, tolerance, and respect” across states that have previously championed rights. Kenneth Roth, the group’s director, pointed to Donald Trump, saying he won the US presidency “with a campaign of hatred against Mexican immigrants, Muslim refugees, and other racial and ethnic minorities, and an evident disdain for women”. Roth warned that the rise of intolerance has caused western powers, including the UK, to become more inward-looking. “With the United States led by a president who displays a disturbing fondness for rights-trampling strongmen, and the UK preoccupied by Brexit, two traditional if flawed defenders of human rights globally are often missing in action,” the report said. Germany, France and their EU partners, many of which are struggling with anti-refugee rhetoric domestically, have failed to fill the vacuum. Instead, Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have “aggressively asserted an anti-rights agenda”. This has allowed mass atrocities in Yemen, Syria, Burma and South Sudan to continue with near impunity. While Human Rights Watch is known for documenting abuses in conflict zones and under repressive regimes, its report criticised intolerance across the US and EU, which Roth warned should not become complacent. Creeping authoritarianism in Poland and Hungary is a “fundamental threat to the entire European project”, he said. “It’s not enough to say this is just something that is affecting a couple of relatively small countries,” he said. “If you allow any member of the European Union to undermine democracy, undermine the rule of law, undermine judicial independence you are allowing exceptions to core EU values – and that’s when you begin to eat away at those values.” Roth accused the EU of hypocrisy for cooperating with the Libyan authorities in order to reduce the number of refugees and migrants reaching Europe. “The conditions there are deadly, nightmarish, and to force somebody back is a blatant violation of international law,” he said. “To pretend they can do that indirectly by training the Libyan coastguard to keep people in, instead of pushing people back, is basically a distinction without a difference.” The report urged the EU to do more to oppose Saudi airstrikes in Yemen, military abuses against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, and Turkey’s crackdown on press freedom. Roth said that while the advocacy group does not have a stance on Brexit, citizens’ human rights will be weakened if the UK withdraws from the European convention on human rights. Populism and immigration pose major threat to global democracy, study says Read more “We’re also frankly concerned about some of the rhetoric of the Brexiteers, which is not only anti-European Union but also anti-European convention on human rights. And there’s a real tendency to demagogue the issue. It’s a very short-sighted approach,” he said. “As much as possible, people should be able to maintain established lives without new restrictions imposed on them because of Brexit.” The report praised mass movement that opposed populism, and said resistance to Trump’s policies in the US have limited the harm that might have been done. “The lesson of the last year is that resistance matters,” said Roth. “The only way to limit the rise of autocrats is to stand up to them. The only way to preserve the values populists attack is to defend them. The battle is very much under way, and it’s one very much worth engaging in.” Topics Governance Human rights Donald Trump news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

She was found dead near Montpellier in France but no one, to date, has been arrested or charged. Photograph: Julie Bindel On a bright autumn day in September 2014, the body of a woman was hauled from the Lunel canal, a stretch of water that crosses a flat, marshy area of Montpellier. French police at first assumed she had drowned. There were no signs of injury, but her nakedness was a cause for concern. The body was that of Silvana Beqiraj, an Albanian. Silvana was originally from Ndërmenas, a village in the district of Fier, an industrial town 100km from the Albanian capital, Tirana. A divorced mother of two, she had migrated to France four years earlier, leaving her young children with her parents. Another Albanian woman, Bukurie Elmazi, also from Fier, had moved to France with Silvana in 2011, having persuaded her to migrate for “better opportunities”, according to Silvana’s family. Elmazi identified the body. “She told us she had moved there to look after an elderly woman,” says Silvana’s father, Mehmet Beqiraj, when I visit the family at their tiny, run-down farm. “But we were all suspicious.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Silvana’s parents, Yllka and Mehmet Beqiraj. Photograph: Julie Bindel A murder investigation was opened in France soon after it was discovered that Silvana had been involved in prostitution in Montpellier, but the family still have no idea what happened to her. The exact cause of death has never been established by police or forensic pathologists, and to date no one has been arrested or charged. Silvana’s family refuse to accept that their daughter was trafficked, preferring to believe that if she was in prostitution, it was voluntary. “If you have a pimp or a trafficker you can’t bring much money in,” says her brother (who did not want to be identified), a man still racked with pain. “She sent us a lot of money. If she had a trafficker he wouldn’t let her send us money.” The evidence, however, suggests otherwise. Her brother says the men who “took Silvana to France” still live in the village, while Mehmet maintains Silvana only sent back small amounts of money, when she was able. Certainly, there was no sign of affluence in the family home. Days after hearing of his daughter’s death, Mehmet travelled to Montpellier to meet with police. “The Albanians [at the consulate] provided only one interpreter and nothing else. I was treated badly and they were arrogant and ignored me,” he says. Silvana’s body was held by the coroner in France for seven months. When it was released, the family was informed it would cost a minimum of €6,000 (£5,336) to transport it back to Albania. “We have no money,” says Mehmet. “We had to find it somehow.” Life in the village had not been easy for Silvana. As with many women from traditional Albanian communities, she entered an arranged marriage when she was 20. After five years, Silvana filed for divorce and moved back to the family home with her children. Within a year, Silvana met Nuri Çela, a man from a neighbouring village. Not long after the couple moved in together, Çela was shot dead as they walked home. “It was over a debt,” says Sylvana’s mother, Yllka, sobbing. “They owed her €3,500 and all Çela did was ask for it back.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Silvana’s mother, Yllka, at the grave of her daughter, close to the family farm in the Fier district of Albania. Photograph: Julie Bindel According to a local journalist, Laureta Rroshi, Silvana had given the money to a trafficking gang to organise her transport and set her up in prostitution in France. Silvana subsequently changed her mind and asked for the money back. It is impossible to tell exactly why Silvana agreed to go to France. But what is known about the trafficking of women from rural Albania is that they are promised a better life, then end up being debt-bonded as a result of the extortionate costs for the journey and subsequent accommodation imposed by traffickers. Their families back home receive threats if they do not comply. “Even Silvana’s children were aware that their mother had been trafficked to France,” says Rroshi. ‘The gangs transporting women are brutal’ In the late 1990s, the Albanian government began to accept that trafficking in women was a serious problem. Experts were brought in to advise on how to identify victims and prosecute perpetrators. Despite such efforts, and the millions of dollars poured into anti-trafficking law enforcement, it remains a serious problem in the Balkan region in general and Albania in particular. National Crime Agency statistics show that, in the third quarter of 2017, the majority of girls and women trafficked into the UK were from Albania. Scant attention is given to trafficking-related crimes in Albania, which means little deterrence. The journey from the southern Albanian port city of Vlora to Brindisi, on the Italian coast, is approximately 90 minutes by speedboat, which is why Vlora became known as the trafficking hub of Albania. Today, Fier is more notorious, but Vlora still has its problems. “I think that trafficking is decreasing,” says Balida, a warm, friendly police officer from the anti-trafficking unit in Vlora. “There are no gangs any more, just men offering marriage to the girls. They go willingly to Italy or wherever.” According to Balida, convictions for traffickers are rare because victims “refuse to cooperate”. “When we call [a complainant] a prostitute, she says, ‘I do it as a profession. This is my profession.’ So if she does not think she is a victim, why should we? “I think, more than the clients, we should criminalise the girls. Because the girls I’ve known do this kind of job for their desire. They are not under pressure, the girls I have met.” Asked how many traffickers she or her team have arrested and interviewed under caution, Balida replies without hesitation. “None,” she says. xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> I was inspected like cattle to see how much they thought I was worth Sara, trafficked to Italy aged 13 “We have groups involved in trafficking but we don’t have proof to arrest them. We just keep them under surveillance but we don’t have proof that they do it.” Was she aware of the Beqiraj case? “Yes, but no one will come forward,” she says. “Maybe she just made enemies, and everyone is scared of them.” In Albania, reprisals towards trafficking victims are as harsh as they are commonplace. Anti-trafficking organisations and police officers tell grim tales of the torture inflicted on girls and women who try to escape. One 20-year old victim who ran away on discovering she was pregnant to one of the men who bought her was found and taken to a building site. In full view of the other women, who had been taken to the site to watch, she was severely beaten before being bricked into a concrete wall while still alive. Other women stay with the traffickers because the criminals know where their families live, and have been told they will die if they dare to escape or go to the police for help. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Four years after Silvana’s body was discovered, police are no further forward with the case. Photograph: Julie Bindel Some women in Vlora have been lucky enough to find support at the Vatra (women’s health) shelter for trafficking victims. In a large, comfortable communal lounge at the centre, about 20 staff, volunteers and residents sit, while children play quietly nearby. Sara, one of the residents, says she was trafficked by a local man when she was 13. “It was a man I believed to be my boyfriend, but he sold me to three men in Tirana, and they took me to Italy,” says Sara, who has a child living with her in the refuge. “On the way I was raped, beaten, humiliated, and even inspected like cattle to see how much they thought I was worth.” Sara escaped when she was told to go to a new brothel in the small town near Turin. “I went to police and thank God they believed me,” she says. “They sent me for help [to the International Organisation for Migration] and they helped me get home. But the police in Vlora did not believe me. They said I was lying because I had been a prostitute in Italy, and that it was my free choice. They said I would be arrested if I bothered them again.” Four years after Silvana’s body was discovered, police are no further forward with the case. “It was a terrible reminder of how dangerous prostitution is for Albanian women,” says a Europol police officer currently on secondment in Albania from western Europe. “The gangs transporting females for this purpose are some of the most brutal we have encountered. Even the Russians are scared of them.” Journalists in Tirana and Fier say no news has filtered through from France about the investigation in a long time. Police in Montpellier likewise claim no information is available. Silvana’s grave is situated on a dry patch of land above her family’s farm. Other kin are buried there, says Yllka. She starts to cry, and asks for help in finding out what happened to her daughter. “[The police] don’t care,” she sobs, “and here they just think the girls are all prostitutes. But someone is to blame.” The grave is merely a plaque embedded into the hard ground, adorned with a photograph of Silvana. “We can’t yet afford a gravestone for her,” says Mehmet, briefly touching the photograph.

Photograph: Claire Thomas/Comité International Olympique Being a refugee, says Olympic runner Yiech Pur Biel, doesn’t mean you are nothing. Biel, a survivor of the Sudanese civil war who ran at the Games in Rio, is now leading a drive to improve sports facilities in refugee camps around the world and raise Olympic aspirations. Biel was 10 when his family’s grass house in Sudan was burned to the ground. Left to fend for himself in the bush, he survived on fruit and leaves before finally reaching a refugee camp in Kenya, where he learned how to run competitively. Ten years later, the 21-year-old was on the starting blocks for the 800 metres in Rio, one of 10 athletes in the first Olympic refugee team. Joining him were two Syrian swimmers, two Congolese judo players, an Ethiopian marathon runner and four other middle-distance runners from South Sudan. All had overcome tremendous hurdles, not only suffering the heartbreak and pain of family separation and loss, but also reaching high levels of fitness in adverse conditions. Biel, at the time, was living with 200,000 others at Kenya’s Kakuma settlement. “In the refugee camp we have no facilities – even shoes we don’t have,” he said, as he prepared to leave for Rio. “There is no gym. Even the weather does not favour training because, from morning up to evening, it is so hot and sunny … Even if I don’t win gold or silver [at Rio] I will show the world that being a refugee you can do something.” In the event, Biel failed to qualify from his 800m heats, but to him just being there was important. He only remembers crying twice in his life; when he was separated from his mother and when he found out he’d been selected to run in Rio. Last month he was given the opportunity to help others like him when he was asked to join the board of the Olympic Refuge Foundation (ORF), which sets up sport facilities for refugee, displaced and vulnerable children. Biel, now 23, says: “I am proud to represent the 65.6 million forcibly displaced people who have had to flee from their homes because of war, famine, manmade and natural disasters.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Yiech Pur Biel, right, alongside other members of the refugee Olympic team in Rio. Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images He is looking forward to using sport as a tool for change for displaced young people around the world. Financed by donations from the Qatar Olympic Committee and the government of Liechtenstein, the ORF is a partnership between the International Olympic Committee and UNHCR. Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, believes that sport for children is vital. “It helps restore childhood and brings some semblance of normalcy in these young but already broken lives. For refugee children, organised sport activities means a safe space in which they can heal, grow and develop. “Sport is an agent for change for displaced and refugee children working to improve their social, physical and emotional wellbeing, regain their self-confidence and develop their skills.” Gloves not guns: fighting the good fight in Rio's brutal favelas | Jo Griffin Read more The publicity surrounding Rio reached his hometown of Nasir, in South Sudan, and led to Biel being reunited on the phone with his mother. She has now moved to a refugee camp in Ethiopia and, although they still speak, they have not yet been reunited in person. Biel has begun studying international relations but trains with the Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation in Kenya in the hope that he will be selected for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. “I can show my fellow refugees that they have a chance, and a hope in life,” he says. “Through education, but also in running, you can change the world.” Topics Global development Kenya South Sudan Olympic Games features Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Digging in holes 50m deep, Sudanese refugees are risking their lives in an area not only littered with landmines but also beset by violence, which claimed at least 25 lives last year. Lowered by rope into the darkness below, they spend hours at a time hacking away at the hard rock by torchlight. The hope is to find a nugget of gold big enough to pay the thousands of pounds demanded by smugglers to take them through Libya and on to boats that offer the chance of a new life in Europe. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Semi-mechanised gold mining in eastern Chad, June 2016. Photograph: Jerome Tubiana/Small Arms Survey Nasrudin Omar Bahar, 29, invested his life savings of £200 to join a group heading to the gold mines of Tibesti, in Chad’s far north. “I had the idea that I could get enough gold to go to Europe,” he says. “I didn’t care which country I went to. My dream place was somewhere where there is peace, serenity and a good living.” But Bahar now lies on a bed in a mud hut in the Farchana refugee camp close to the border with Darfur. He fled Darfur in 2007 when the Arab militia known as the Janjaweed attacked and burned his village of Tandikoro. Vibrations from the heavy machinery needed to crush the mined stones caused the shaft to collapse on top of him. The rockfall left him paralysed from the waist down. He explains that living conditions in the camp were what drove him to leave the settlement. “Life was very difficult and we couldn’t support ourselves … Then I heard of a group who were going looking for gold, and so I left the camp,” he says. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nasrudin Omar Bahar is paralysed from the waist down following a gold mining accident in Tibesti. He is being looked after by his sister, Manira. Photograph: Gethin Chamberlain Word of the potential riches to be made in the gold fields has spread around the settlements. In Goz Beïda, Mohamed Jouma Ahamed, 41, the inspector of schools in Djabal camp, said that his brother Ahamed had joined the gold rush in the hope of making enough to buy his passage to Europe. “Staying here isn’t easy, and so we would prefer to go to Europe,” he says. “There are many young boys who attempt to go to Europe by sea through Libya. “They go to the region in the far north of Chad where they search for gold, and they get cash and pay smugglers to take them over to Libya. My brother went to Tibesti to search for gold and got some, and the smugglers took them in cars to Libya.” Queuing all day for a three-minute call: reuniting families torn apart by Boko Haram | Ruth Maclean Read more Around 323,000 people who escaped the fighting that broke out in Darfur in 2003 live in camps on the Chadian side of the border with Sudan. Attempts to persuade them to return home have foundered amid fresh outbreaks of violence, with thousands of people fleeing over the border into Chad in recent months. The headman of Tenbeba village in Darfur, Mahamat Khatir Idriss, 60, describes how he and about a thousand others had to flee when the Janjaweed attacked after years of rapes, beating and intimidation. “There is no negotiating with them. They came with their guns and we were prisoners in our own village,” he says. “When our children went to get food they were beaten, when the women went to get water they were assaulted. There was rape.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mahamat Khatir Idriss, headman of Tenbeba village in Darfur, fled to Treguine refugee camp in Chad with a thousand other villagers after they were attacked by Janjaweed last year. Photograph: Gethin Chamberlain He and many of the villagers eventually reached Treguine camp in eastern Chad. He said they had been powerless to defend themselves from the Arab militia, who have been blamed for carrying out much of the violence against the black African farmers during the long-running conflict. He accused troops from the UN-African Union Mission in Darfur (Unamid) of failing to protect civilians from attack. “Soldiers would come and take information when something happened, but they didn’t do anything.” He says they were given phone numbers to call Unamid for assistance but claims the UN forces would not intervene to prevent attacks. “Even when we call them, they don’t come. They didn’t fight to protect the local people. They go away.” Another of the villagers, Fatna Idriss Adam, 25, says they had been persecuted by “the Arabs”. She describes how the Janjaweed attacked the village in August, killing a policeman and setting fire to houses, forcing the villagers to flee. “Some were on foot and some were on horses. The Arabs were shooting, and three people were wounded and one was killed. I was in the fields. I heard the shooting, so I ran across the river with my baby.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Refugees from Tenbeba village at Treguine refugee camp in eastern Chad. Fatna Idriss Adam is first on the left in the front row. Photograph: Gethin Chamberlain She says the trouble started when one of the Janjaweed was arrested by local police for trying to graze his cattle on a farmer’s land. The Janjaweed took revenge by killing a policeman and driving out the villagers. The Sudanese government has been accused of exploiting traditional rivalries between the nomadic Arab herders and the settled black African farmers, arming the Janjaweed to take on rebel non-Arab groups. “We lived with a kind of fear between the two communities,” Adam says. She and hundreds of other villagers have resolved to stay at Treguine and have started building houses on land allocated to them. “Here it is better because the Arabs will leave us in peace,” she adds. At the height of the conflict in Darfur, between 2003 and 2005, the plight of refugees from what was described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis was often in the international spotlight. One meal a day: the Lake Chad crisis in pictures Read more But now those supporting the refugee camps – including the European commission’s aid organisation, Echo – are concerned that funding is drying up. There have been attempts to persuade the refugees to return by arranging for small groups of their representatives to visit Darfur to assess the security situation. But one of those who visited last year, Adam Ismail Abdallah, 38, says they had returned to the Djabal camp more convinced than ever that Darfur remained unsafe. “Everything was the same – the killing, rape, everything,” he says. “The Arab tribes … are living on our land, in our villages.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest A Janjaweed fighter in Darfur. Photograph: Adam Ismail Abdallah/Courtesy of Gethin Chamberlain It is against this background that the discovery of gold in northern Chad has tempted some in the camps to believe there may yet be a way out of their predicament. Gold was discovered around Tibesti in 2012, and since then people have flocked to the mines from across the region. A report published last year noted that the thousands of prospectors included refugees from Darfur. But competition is fierce and last year dozens of people died in violent clashes between miners. Others struggle to make enough to survive. Bahar says he barely makes enough to buy food. But for him, there is a happy ending – of sorts. Despite his catastrophic injuries, his dream of reaching Europe did not die at the bottom of the mine shaft. Finland has agreed to grant him asylum and he is due to be flown out of Chad with his sister Manira at the end of the month.

Photograph: Bruce Adams/ANL/Rex/Shutterstock Local authorities are calling on members of the public to be alert to signs of modern-day slavery, as research suggests worrying gaps in reporting across Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Lancashire. The number of people referred to the government’s national referral mechanism (NRM), which identifies and supports victims, increased dramatically last summer. Between July and September 2017, 1,322 potential victims were referred, up 47% compared with the same period in 2016. The invisible people - Modern Slavery – in pictures Read more But the National Crime Agency estimated that the number of victims was far greater, with tens of thousands of people living in conditions of slavery in the UK. Simon Blackburn, a councillor and chair of the Local Government Association’s (LGA) safer and stronger communities board, warned that residents may be “unwittingly using victims of modern slavery to wash their cars, paint their nails or lay their drives”. Quick guide Modern slavery Show Hide What is modern slavery? About 150 years after most countries banned slavery – Brazil was the last to abolish its participation in the transatlantic slave trade, in 1888 – millions of men, women and children are still enslaved. Contemporary slavery takes many forms, from women forced into prostitution, to child slavery in agriculture supply chains or whole families working for nothing to pay off generational debts. Slavery thrives on every continent and in almost every country. Forced labour, people trafficking, debt bondage and child marriage are all forms of modern-day slavery that affect the world's most vulnerable people. How many people are enslaved across the world? The UN's International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates that about 21 million people are in forced labour at any point in time. The ILO says this estimate includes trafficking and other forms of modern slavery. They calculate that 90% of the 21 million are exploited by individuals or companies, while 10% are forced to work by the state, rebel military groups, or in prisons under conditions that violate ILO standards. Sexual exploitation accounts for 22% of slaves. Where does slavery exist? Slavery exists in one form or another in every country. Asia accounts for more than half of the ILO's 21 million estimate. In terms of percentage of population, central and south-east Europe has the highest prevalence of forced labour, followed by Africa, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean. Who is profiting? In 2005, the ILO estimated that illegal profits from forced labour amounted to more than $44bn. The UN's global initiative to fight trafficking says people trafficking is the third-largest global criminal industry (pdf) behind drugs and arms trafficking. The ILO estimates that people in forced labour lose at least $21bn each year in unpaid wages and recruitment fees. Slavery also exists within global supply chains, generating huge profits for those who control this industry in free labour. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. According to research released on Wednesday, under-reporting is a major concern in areas such as Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Lancashire, Dyfed-Powys and Norfolk. The study predicts areas are likely to have higher rates of modern slavery if they have an above average number of people who are foreign born or who do not have qualifications. The research, by global risk analysts Verisk Maplecroft, used demographic data to predict the rates of slavery across 42 UK police force areas, and compared this with UK National Crime Agency victim data from 2015-16 and 2016-17. Based on demographics, the report estimated that Leicestershire should be among the 10 most vulnerable areas. But according to government victim data, it has one of the lowest prevalence rates for slavery. “The extensive reports of exploitative labour conditions in Leicester’s garment factories, published by the media, Leicester University and the UK parliament’s human rights committee, suggest the idea of a reporting gap for Leicestershire is not unreasonable,” the report said. “More investigation of these areas could therefore lead to the discovery of more potential victims.” The invisible people - Modern Slavery – in pictures Read more In 2015, a damning report revealed endemic exploitation inside the East Midlands garment industry. According to researchers at the University of Leicester, up to 90% of those working in the sector were paid £3 an hour – less than half the legal minimum wage. Verisk Maplecroft’s report ranked England’s largest cities as most susceptible to modern slavery. London, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Bradford and Manchester are all located in the five most vulnerable police force areas. The five areas ranked least vulnerable were Cumbria, Devon and Cornwall, Gloucestershire, North Yorkshire and Sussex. Such areas are more rural, perform better for education and have a lower proportion of foreign-born residents. The report’s authors added that while major cities had higher rates of modern slavery, there were also frequent reports in the agricultural sector, on cannabis farms and in coastal port towns. It was also reported this week that “slave workers” from eastern Europe were being used to collect donated clothes from households on behalf of charities. The Times said men were arrested in Newcastle and Gateshead after an investigation into a suspected Lithuanian organised crime group. A dozen people were rescued from alleged slavery. The LGA, which represents 370 councils and all fire and rescue authorities in England and Wales, said the public should look out for warning signs, such as large numbers of people being transported to properties in vans, early in the morning or late at night. “Members of the public are our first line of defence when it comes to tackling this scourge, and we urge all our residents to be aware of the tell-tale warning signs of modern slavery, and report any concerns to police or their local authority,” said Blackburn. Other signs thought to indicate modern slavery include people who look as if they are being instructed or coached by somebody else, or who do not appear free to leave or move around their surroundings. Victims may appear deprived of food, water, medical care or sleep, or look to be in a situation of dependence. Kevin Hyland, the independent anti-slavery commissioner, said he had personally witnessed the impact of a member of the public reporting their suspicions to a local authority. “Police raided a carwash within weeks of the tipoff, identifying 12 potential victims of modern slavery in the process and arresting an individual on human trafficking offences,” he said. “The trigger was one individual noticing the ill-health of those manning the carwash.” Topics Global development Modern-day slavery in focus Slavery news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed World UK Science Cities Global development Football Tech Business Environment Obituaries back to top become a supporter make a contribution securedrop ask for help advertise with us work for us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy digital newspaper archive all topics all contributors Facebook Twitter © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Antonio Masiello/Getty Images Ever since the Norman era, the fine art of the meaningful gift has been at the heart of statecraft. Historically, they have ranged from a menagerie of exotic animals to fabulous jewels, but Emmanuel Macron – by first offering the Chinese a horse called Vesuvius, and now offering the British the loan of the Bayeux tapestry – has revealed himself this month as the modern master of the diplomatic gesture. Most contemporary diplomatic gifts reveal more vulgarity than thought. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman gave the former US president Barack Obama a silver-toned letter opener and pen priced at $56,729 (£41,000), while the president of Argentina brought the first family a black electric bicycle worth $1,499 and two signed Lionel Messi shirts worth $1,700. Other modern diplomatic gifts have come cheaper; in 2009, the then US secretary of state, Hilary Clinton, presented the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, with a large red “reset button” to represent a reboot in relations – except that the Russian word emblazoned on the button did not translate as “reset” but “overcharge”. Others are just best forgotten: Gordon Brown went home with a DVD box set hastily bought from the local store by Obama’s novice aides. Emmanuel Macron agrees to loan Bayeux Tapestry to Britain Read more Macron, by contrast, operates through loftier symbols. His official portrait is laden with more signals than a Renaissance court portrait; Donald Trump was invited to Bastille Day celebrations last year to see the military might of France and, by implication, the European contribution to Nato; and Macron chose to make his big speech on the refounding of European sovereignty in Greece in front of the Acropolis, the birthplace of democracy. Last week Macron promised to sign a “Quirinal Treaty” of friendship with Italy, seizing on the treaty idea when suggested by a journalist at a press conference. He would like the European parliamentary seats vacated by the British to be elected on a trans-Europe basis. Nationalism replaced by federalism. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The horse given by Macron to Xi Jinping on the French president’s visit to China. Photograph: Imaginechina/Rex/Shutterstock “Modern political life must rediscover a sense of symbolism,” Macron told the German Der Spiegel newspaper in October. “We need to develop a kind of political heroism. We need to be amenable again to creating grand narratives.” Behind the symbolism lies a frenetic activism and an opportunist’s eye. With Germany preoccupied by coalition talks, the US on the verge of a breakdown, and Theresa May lost in Brexit, the opportunity for France to be the transformative leader of Europe is unparalleled. Context has given him greater credibility. As a result, the roll call of power brokers beating a path to the Elysée is extraordinary. Equally, he travels. Since he became president Macron has visited Africa five times, helping to establish the G5 Sahel taskforce. He will go to Senegal next month. By contrast, no British prime minister has been to Africa since 2013 and the UK diplomatic footprint is diminishing. In Saudi Arabia, Macron engineered the release of the Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, and in Iran he has supported the nuclear deal. Foreign Office ministers privy to ambassadorial cables from around the world say from August they started seeing the word France with increasing frequency. Macron himself says it is the duty of France to talk to everyone. There is also a mission to explain. In two marathon speeches on French foreign policy he has set out his determination to take France beyond the old debates between Atlanticism and Gaullism. Security, migration, optimism, multilateralism and unashamed support for a more integrated Europe emerged as the great themes. The extent to which his recent ubiquity will have been a substitute for impact will emerge in the years ahead. Both Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande started with overseas ambition. Ultimately, the fate of his European mission rests in Berlin, and the willingness of Angela Merkel to go along with a version of his plans for strengthening the eurozone with a minister and a budget. Merkel, more attuned to the resistance to such ideas in eastern Europe, is under pressure from her SPD partners to agree. Privately, Macron – at least before his election – was contemptuous of the Brexit decision. He will look for every possible national advantage on financial services, but his aides insist that however the talks end, he wants Britain, one of the world’s great military powers, to remain engaged in European security and foreign policy. After all, the Bayeux tapestry is an elegant warning to the French and the British of the consequences of falling out.

It is due to be loaned to Britain in 2022. Photograph: Stephane Maurice/AFP/Getty Images As a British-born, adopted Norman, I am delighted that the Bayeux tapestry may be going on a short holiday to Britain after 952 years. The tapestry (actually an embroidery) is a remarkable and remarkably modern piece of art. It is often described as the “first strip cartoon” and the “first movie storyboard”. Less frequently observed is the fact that it preceded television 24-hour news channels by nine centuries in its neat use of scroll bars to provide extra information above and below the main action. Emmanuel Macron agrees to loan Bayeux Tapestry to Britain Read more I would like, however, to correct a common misconception. The tapestry does not tell the story of the “last time this country was invaded and subjugated” as Robert Peston suggested in a tweet. Others made similar comments, claiming that the proposed loan of the tapestry was a “Gallic joke”. This is silly. We are not Anglo-Saxons. Taking England alone, and leaving aside the rest of the United Kingdom, the Bayeux Tapestry portrays our invasion of ourselves. England in the 21st century is racially and culturally the product of many things but we owe as much to William’s Normans as to Harold’s Anglo-Saxons. If you live in Normandy as I mostly do (about 20 miles from Bayeux), you are reminded of this fact daily. You see it in your neighbours’ faces, in the architecture, in the soft beauty of the countryside. England, especially southern England, is part of a Greater Normandy. We are a Norman colony which has surpassed its motherland, just as the United States has surpassed the United Kingdom. My next-door neighbour, Madeleine, Norman for many generations, is a dead-ringer for Dandy Nichols, the actor who played Alf Garnett’s wife in the 1960s sitcom Till Death Us Do Part. Her husband, Michel, also Norman for generations, looks like a police sergeant or army corporal from a British film of the 1950s. If you stare at a Norman supermarket queue, you will find some irretrievably French faces, but most Normans would pass unnoticed in Manchester or Brighton. Many English churches look like Norman churches. Many Norman farmhouses look like southern English farmhouses. Our supple and beautiful language is rooted in Anglo-Saxon – but it became supple and beautiful when it was interbred with Norman French. Nonetheless, we persist in thinking of ourselves as the cultural descendants of the Anglo-Saxons, rather than the Normans, a case of mistaken self-identity that has profound consequences almost a millennium later. William’s conquest was the founding act of our “Brentry” into European culture and politics. This is a truth that we have refused to internalise. A classic and telling example is the Latin inscription over the biggest British war cemetery in Normandy, situated on the edge of Bayeux, a mile or so from the home of the tapestry. The inscription reads: “Nos A Gulielmo Victi Victoris Patriam Liberavimus”, or, “We, who were once conquered by William, have now liberated the conqueror’s native land.” The Bayeux Tapestry – historic, yes, but is it any good? Read more This is moving but wrong. The British troops who invaded Normandy on 6 June 1944 were not, as implied, the descendants of Harold’s army at Hastings. Leave aside the many Scots and Welsh and Irish soldiers, not to mention those soldiers of colour. The English participants on D-Day were as much descendants of William’s victorious army as Harold’s defeated one. You only have to look at the names on the graves in the cemetery. There are many Anglo-Saxon names but also scores that have Norman origins: Elliot, Hay, Forrester, Sage, Russell, Talbot. Even Montgomery is a Norman name – the field marshall was liberating his ancestors’ homeland. The tapestry is therefore truly “coming home”. It was long thought to have been sewn by the ladies in waiting of Queen Matilda, William’s formidable spouse who ruled Normandy in his absence. It is now generally believed to have been sewn by Anglo-Saxon noblewomen in Kent, on the command of William’s half-brother, Odo, the bishop of Bayeux. It has been in Bayeux ever since the 11th century, apart from a brief period when it was stolen by the Gestapo in 1944, then recovered in Paris and displayed in the Louvre in 1945. Its return to Britain after 950 years should not be seen as a “Gallic joke” to remind us of the last time we were invaded and subjugated. It should be seen as the rediscovery – too late, perhaps – of our birth certificate as a European nation. Maybe that is what Emmanuel Macron had in mind. • John Lichfield is a journalist based in France Topics Bayeux tapestry Opinion France Europe Museums Emmanuel Macron comment Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

The ruling last week boosted Democrats’ hopes of taking the House of Representatives. Photograph: Chris Keane/Reuters The last time North Carolina Republicans redrew the state’s 13 congressional districts, they made absolutely no secret of their ambition to rig the system and lock in a 10-3 balance in their favour – regardless of whether they or the Democrats won a majority of the votes in future elections. “I think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats,” bragged the chair of the redistricting committee in the state general assembly, David Lewis. “So I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country.” Drastic improvements in mapping technologies and voter information databases meant specialist mapmakers had unprecedented power to manipulate political outcomes, even in a swing state like North Carolina where one would ordinarily expect to see US House and state legislative seats split more or less evenly between the two parties. Gerrymander 5K: run highlights absurdity of Republican redistricting Read more The instruction from Lewis and his colleagues, according to court documents, was “to create as many districts as possible in which GOP candidates would be able to successfully compete for office”. That was in 2016, when the prevailing wisdom across the US was that partisan gerrymandering was one of the legitimate spoils of American politics. Up to that point, the courts had punished gerrymandering along racial lines – one North Carolina map from the 1990s that packed black voters into the fewest possible districts was memorably likened to “political apartheid” – but raised little or no objection to state maps that favored one party over another. That may be about to change dramatically, in the wake of a bombshell ruling from a federal court in North Carolina last week that found the 2016 redistricting plan to be a violation of both the constitution’s equal protection clause and an infringement on the free speech of voters who cannot meaningfully cast a ballot if the outcome is all but predetermined. The court ordered the legislature to come up with new, fairer maps within two weeks and said if they did not, a court-appointed expert would redraw the maps for them. The ruling, most of it supported unanimously by two liberal justices and one conservative, was widely seen as breaking new legal ground and could – if it is not stayed or overturned – make it significantly easier for the Democrats to retake control of the House of Representatives in this November’s midterm elections. The ruling also picked up on a growing disquiet among justices on the US supreme court, who have questioned whether the political system is sustainable without the core principle that “voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around”. The supreme court is already considering two partisan gerrymandering cases – one from Wisconsin (run by Republicans) and one from Maryland (run by Democrats). It now seems likely that the North Carolina case will be included in the court’s deliberations and that a new overarching standard for drawing district boundaries will emerge before the court’s term ends in June. “This is the first time ever that a congressional districting plan has been struck down as partisan gerrymander,” one of the plaintiff’s attorneys, Ruth Greenwood of the Campaign Legal Center, told the Guardian. “If we are able to keep that precedent, it could be applied to half a dozen other states.” ‘Sociological gobbledegook’? Not everyone gerrymanders. In the complex patchwork of America’s political landscape, there are states that delegate redistricting to independent commissions and states where one party is so dominant there is no incentive to gerrymander. Some of the worst offenders, however, are also some of the most important states in presidential elections – among them Wisconsin, North Carolina, Florida and Pennsylvania – which often hold the key to control of the House of Representatives too. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Supreme court chief justice John Roberts leads a panel interested in – but divided on – gerrymandering cases. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP Several times over the past 20 years, the Democrats have won more votes for House seats than the Republicans but ended up in the minority. The same has been true of state legislatures – most recently in Virginia, where the Democrats beat the GOP by 9% in races for the state House of Delegates in 2016 but won only 49 of 100 seats. While other factors have played a role – most notably, the clustering of Democrats in urban districts, leading to a more inefficient distribution of their votes – gerrymandering has effectively received a turbo boost because of digital mapping technologies and significantly altered both the political and the legal landscape. Justice Anthony Kennedy, expected to be the swing vote on the supreme court, has been open since at least 2004 to the idea that partisan gerrymandering could one day become so sophisticated as to be constitutionally intolerable. Trump's 'voter fraud' commission is dead – but activists fear new DHS push Read more And while some of his colleagues appear hostile to statistical analyses measuring the precise extent of partisan interference in district mapping – chief justice John Roberts called such analyses “sociological gobbledegook” when the Wisconsin case came up for oral argument in October – the North Carolina case presents a welter of new evidence and legal arguments to consider. “North Carolina may present a set of facts that give the supreme court the hook they are looking for,” another of the plaintiff’s lawyers, Kathay Feng of Common Cause, told the Guardian. It is also helpful that Maryland is in the mix, because it means there are plaintiffs from both major parties and the supreme court is at least partly insulated from the charge that they are responding to complaints from partisan sore losers. “Justice Kennedy cares a lot about the court’s role in upholding a standard of laws that is not seen as tipping the scales in favor of one party or another,” Feng said. Many questions remain about timing. The North Carolina state legislature was widely expected to appeal last week’s ruling but did not do so immediately.

Scandal surrounds a $2bn loan for a tuna fishing fleet which has so far generated little or no revenue. Photograph: Adrien Barbier/AFP/Getty Images Global interest rates are rising. Poor countries are finding it tough to pay back money borrowed from banks in anticipation of a commodity windfall that never materialised. Stir in some dirty dealing that has seen funds stolen and what do you have? That’s right: the makings of another debt crisis. Poor country debt was supposed to have been sorted back in 2005, the year the Guardian changed from a broadsheet to its Berliner format. Now, 13 years later, we are changing format again and debt is back albeit in a different form. Last time, the focus was on public debt, money that poor-country governments owed to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and individual rich nations – and which was mostly forgiven as a result of the Gleneagles G8 agreement in 2005. These days, the issue is private-sector debt and while as yet only a handful of countries – mostly in sub-Saharan Africa – are in serious trouble, the warning signs are there. The IMF and the World Bank both know it. Why should Somalia’s children starve to pay for a debt crisis they didn't create? | Kevin Watkins Read more Africa needs more private-sector investment because debt relief and western aid have not been enough on their own to bring about economic modernisation. And in the years immediately after the 2008 financial crisis investing in Africa was attractive. Debt relief and better financial management meant African countries looked more stable. The money creation process known as quantitative easing meant western banks and other financial institutions were awash with funds. Ultra-low interest rates in the developed world meant investors were scouring the world for higher yields than they could obtain at home. Many African countries were also exporters of commodities that were in high demand due to China’s rapid growth. Deals were done in which western banks lent money for projects in African countries, with the debt to be paid off by the proceeds of rising commodity prices. That was the theory. In practice, some ropey deals were done, of which a prime example is the one made in London five years ago between Credit Suisse and Russia’s VTB bank to lend $2bn to two companies in Mozambique backed by the government in Maputo. The money was supposed to be for a tuna fishing fleet and for a navy to protect the boats operating in Mozambique’s territorial waters. Credit Suisse and VTB trousered $200m between them in fees, but the loans were never revealed to the Mozambique parliament, the IMF, the financial markets or the Mozambique people. A report into the deal by the corporate investigations company Kroll concluded that the two companies were inadequately managed and had generated no meaningful revenue. At least a quarter of the money is unaccounted for, with some suspicion that it was spent on military equipment. Jamie Drummond, the director of the development campaign group One says that it is not clear the money ever turned up in Mozambique after being sent to two offshore companies in Abu Dhabi. For sure, though, not a single tuna has been landed. Mozambique has paid a heavy price for defaulting on the debt, which has been sold on to vulture funds. The IMF, miffed at being lied to, has suspended its programme and the loss of financial support has meant public services are being cut. The scandal has rightly attracted the attention of the FBI, which is investigating whether the banks facilitated corruption. Although this is a particularly egregious example of a deal that has gone badly wrong, Mozambique is not the only country in difficulty. The Jubilee Debt Campaign said that at the end of 2017, 28 countries were rated as in debt distress or at high risk of debt distress, up from 22 at the end of 2016, and 15 in 2013. The number of countries classified as low risk has more than halved – from 24 in 2013 to 11 currently. This is not yet a full-blown debt crisis but it could easily become one. The commodity boom is over, China is growing less rapidly and the cost of servicing loans taken out in foreign currencies is becoming more expensive as interest rates rise in the developed world. To lessen the threat of a rerun of what happened during the debt crisis of the early 1980s (when the windfall gains from oil producing countries were recycled into loans to Latin America) action should be taken now. At the international level, there needs to be better monitoring of how vulnerable countries are to rising debt. There is a certain complacency about the fact that most of the current debt is owed to the private sector; history shows that ultimately it will end up as public debt. For years, there has been a campaign for a bankruptcy system that would treat countries like companies. This, though, has been relentlessly opposed by countries such as the US and the UK, where the powerful financial sectors make money out of bad debts. Not only should western governments back a sovereign debt bankruptcy scheme, the should also insist that all new debt include clauses that offer protection from vulture funds, companies that seek to make a profit on debt they have bought on the cheap. Developing countries need to do more – a lot more in some cases – to tackle corruption, but so do the banks. One idea is a Transparent Lending Covenant, under which banks would make the full details of loans public. Interestingly, the idea is being pushed by Tidjane Thiam, who took over as chief executive of Credit Suisse after the Mozambique loan was agreed. It’s not hard to see why. The tuna deal stank in every way. It was bad for Mozambique, bad for the City and bad for Credit Suisse. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.

1603\Science\It’s hard to miss a musk ox: It looks like a buffalo decked out in a hairy fur coat. And yet this easy-to-spot giant, which lives on tundras from Siberia to Greenland, is still surprisingly mysterious. “Here is the largest land mammal of the polar zones, but we hardly know anything about musk oxen,” said Joel Berger, a wildlife biologist at Colorado State University and a senior scientist at the Wildlife Conservation Society. Dr. Berger has studied musk oxen in Alaska for nearly a decade, and on Thursday in the journal Nature, he and his colleagues reported a disturbing finding: Musk oxen are unexpectedly vulnerable to rapid climate change in the Arctic. In a warming landscape, pregnant female musk oxen may struggle to find enough food for their unborn calves, the researchers found. Their undersized offspring may die young or fail to produce many calves of their own. In places, musk oxen may disappear altogether. The study is the first to suggest a strong link between increasing winter rainfall and the declining health of Arctic mammals, said R. Terry Bowyer, a senior research scientist at the Institute of Arctic Biology in Fairbanks, Alaska, who was not involved in the research. Other grazing species, like caribou or Dall sheep, also may be harmed by increasing rain in the Arctic, Dr. Bowyer said: “It bodes poorly for big mammals.” A decade ago, Dr. Berger began traveling to Alaska to gather data on musk oxen. Each summer, he and his colleagues cruised across the frozen tundra in a sort of snow tractor until they found a herd. Rather than running away, the animals would form a defensive circle. Dr. Berger used long-lens cameras to snap photographs of individuals and bounced lasers off them to determine how far away they were. Back at his office, Dr. Berger and his colleagues examined the pictures to determine how young musk oxen were growing each summer. It was a tough job. “In the wind, their hair is fluttering all over the place, so we don’t know where the hair stops and the body begins,” Dr. Berger said. Fortunately, a musk ox’s face has short hair, and the size of a musk ox’s head is a good indicator of its overall body size. “Our accuracy in measuring head size is about 99 percent,” Dr. Berger said. Calves born in some years remained undersized even three years after birth, he and his colleagues found. To determine why, they also gathered data about the conditions in which the musk oxen lived. One factor emerged as a major predictor of size: how often rain fell during the winter. Females that were pregnant during winters with a lot of rain gave birth to undersized calves, sometimes as much as 15 percent smaller. Dr. Berger started collaborating with Russian scientists to study a population of musk oxen on Wrangel Island, off the coast of northeastern Siberia. The island receives more than twice as many rainfalls during the winter as Dr. Berger’s research sites in Alaska. And on Wrangel Island, he and his colleagues discovered, young musk oxen had significantly smaller heads than their Alaskan cousins. Normally, musk oxen survive each winter by pushing their snouts through snow to find lichen, moss and other plants. When rain falls, it freezes and forms an icy barrier over the food. Dr. Berger suspects that’s why winter rain leaves musk oxen struggling to eat. A pregnant female musk ox is especially vulnerable: “She’s starting her gestating fetus,” Dr. Berger said. The calves of these undernourished mothers will be born small, and they will stay undersized even if they find a regular supply of food as they mature. Research on other big mammals indicates that being born small leaves animals more vulnerable to starvation and disease as they grow. Dr. Berger suspects that his analysis actually underestimates the impact of winter rain. He and his colleagues were able to photograph only young musk oxen that had survived each winter, so it is possible that they missed runts that died between visits. Runts can be bad for the entire herd. Even if small animals survive their early years, it may take them longer to become sexually mature. Winter rain, then, may push down musk oxen populations. These findings are more worrisome because of the drastic change humans are bringing to the climate. The Arctic itself is warming at twice the average global rate. Researchers have focused much of their attention on the Arctic Ocean, which is losing much of its ice. Algae are growing much more vigorously in the warmer climate. Polar bears are losing some of the sea ice they need to hunt for seals, leaving them vulnerable to extinction in decades to come. Climate change is threatening to land mammals, as well. If winter rains become more common in places like Siberia and Alaska, Dr. Berger warned, the range of musk oxen may drastically shrink. Indeed, they may survive only in places like northern Greenland, which has remained drier and colder than other parts of the Arctic. Dr. Berger cautioned that he and his colleagues followed musk oxen only until they were three years old. It will take much more data to determine the long-term fate of the animals. “Most people don’t do that much groundwork on the Arctic because it’s hard to get around,” Dr. Berger said. “It’s no big surprise we know very little.”\0.6098754405975342,-0.2926975190639496,-0.840250551700592,0.1548362672328949,-0.4603053331375122,1.978846788406372,1.5133031606674194,0.13181842863559723,-1.6058205366134644,-0.29600775241851807,0.6574620008468628,1.2175766229629517,-0.9769697189331055,-0.07180002331733704,-1.3809112310409546,0.47769027948379517,-0.24134963750839233,0.8523344397544861,0.5981969833374023,0.10405807942152023,0.769914984703064,0.0440082848072052,1.1319472789764404,-2.360232353210449,-0.02976066619157791,0.5398621559143066,1.6826722621917725,0.41502252221107483,-0.022958535701036453,-0.9122340679168701,-0.6699592471122742,1.1729109287261963,-0.6725630760192871,0.3434678912162781,0.20481103658676147,-0.40074047446250916,-0.6641577482223511,-0.5942052602767944,-0.0772237777709961,-0.22110719978809357,-0.08664163202047348,-1.4970290660858154,1.5003527402877808,-0.3398137092590332,0.6867855787277222,0.9426631927490234,1.3270951509475708,-1.2526201009750366,-0.9202608466148376,-1.2311588525772095,1.1049469709396362,-0.1746252179145813,0.18463608622550964,0.07608106732368469,0.2734563648700714,0.545002281665802,1.2671129703521729,-0.5642162561416626,-0.857982337474823,1.3607593774795532,0.01769687421619892,-1.7841676473617554,0.934292197227478,-0.5493607521057129,-0.4343925714492798,0.4480440020561218,0.5175058841705322,0.9072834849357605,-0.8997881412506104,-0.10780646651983261,-0.30237290263175964,-0.006875006947666407,0.34550559520721436,0.9421926736831665,-0.31400197744369507,-1.3743703365325928,0.5387263298034668,0.37737447023391724,-1.483145833015442,-1.949480652809143,0.09613098204135895,-1.012171745300293,-2.170288562774658,1.0414917469024658,-0.30731531977653503,-0.6552367210388184,1.0922539234161377,-0.03733926638960838,0.6658647060394287,-0.4682060182094574,-0.7972818613052368,1.389301061630249,-1.301864743232727,0.8167058825492859,0.5591740012168884,1.7073456048965454,0.6326872706413269,-0.5040319561958313,-1.4656703472137451,-0.4620785117149353\NYTIMES\Matter: In the Arctic, More Rain May Mean Fewer Musk Oxen\2018-01-18 11:00:25.0\
1604\Science\Among saiga antelopes, the month of May ought to be about new life. But in 2015, it was just the opposite for the Betpak-Dala saiga population in central Kazakhstan. In only three weeks, about 220,000 of the critically endangered antelopes, most of them newborns and mothers that had gathered to calve, dropped dead across an area the size of Britain. In a study published today in Science Advances, researchers presented a preliminary account of the cause of the mysterious die-off: Bacteria called Pasteurella multocida, which seem normally to exist harmlessly in saigas’ tonsils, somehow invaded their guts, poisoning their blood and breaking down their organs, leading to death within a few hours. The mechanism that allowed the bacteria to become so harmful is still unclear, but the scientists believe it had something to do with a peculiarly wet and warm period before the outbreak. “One possible explanation might be that climate change is driving these events,” said Richard Kock, a professor at the Royal Veterinary College in London and an author of the paper. There have been a series of such die-offs in recent years, he noted, but the team found no evidence for these events before the 1980s. [READ: Animals Die in Large Numbers, and Researchers Scratch Their Heads] Scientists now need to model how climate change might affect saigas in the future, particularly if unusually wet and warm weather events become more common in their range. In the new study, Dr. Kock and his colleagues first confirmed that P. multocida was the immediate cause of death in 2015. They ruled out other pathogens and toxins (including Russian rocket chemicals, as a handful of ecologists had speculated). They found nothing significant in the soil or the vegetation the antelopes had been exposed to, and determined that the animals were not nutritionally deficient or immunosuppressed. What did show a strong correlation with the die-off in 2015 — as well as two similar events in 1981 and 1988 — were the average relative humidity and average minimum temperatures in the 10 days leading up to mass mortality. During these 10 days, if relative humidity is greater than 80 percent, there’s a strong possibility of outbreak, said Wendy Beauvais, a postdoctoral student in veterinary medicine at Cornell University and an author of the study. It’s clear that an environmental trigger allowed the bacteria to wreak havoc, but how remains a mystery, Dr. Kock said. The 100 percent fatality rate that occurred in 2015 was unprecedented among similar outbreaks in other large mammals. “I’ve worked with many nasty things,” he said. “You always get survivors.” Another contributing factor may be the saiga’s unique life history. Since females give births to unusually large calves, they tend to be stressed and more susceptible to disease during calving season. Furthermore, the antelopes have evolved specific mechanisms to deal with cycles of weather extremes in the Eurasian steppe, including their Seussian trunks, which facilitate heat exchange and keep out dust. The more “fine-tuned” an animal is to specialized conditions, the more vulnerable it might be to change, Dr. Kock said. [READ: Saiga Population Grows After Mysterious Epidemic] Going forward, conservationists perhaps won’t be able to stop environmental change, but they can try to make sure the world’s five saiga populations are resilient enough to cope with disease outbreaks, said E.J. Milner-Gulland, a professor of biodiversity at Oxford and an author of the paper. This means managing other threats, such as encroachment on the saigas’ habitat and poaching. “Saigas have a history of bouncing back,” she said, “so we always have hope.”\0.3235558867454529,-0.5361365675926208,-0.8952038288116455,-0.08103387802839279,-0.9769002795219421,0.9102960228919983,1.6454941034317017,0.0032504156697541475,-0.19068853557109833,-0.8289163112640381,0.14961613714694977,1.0537112951278687,-0.3314487636089325,-0.09912696480751038,-0.9309434294700623,0.6674811840057373,-0.17964597046375275,0.5064783096313477,-0.2068856805562973,0.7202795743942261,1.0493440628051758,-0.7824485898017883,-0.14353905618190765,0.7744325399398804,-0.1964322328567505,0.2767215371131897,0.5176602005958557,0.18431773781776428,1.2657865285873413,0.7089605331420898,0.7855147123336792,0.15195788443088531,-0.45188233256340027,0.7343172430992126,-0.008520492352545261,-0.7220039963722229,-0.3803083598613739,0.38135263323783875,-0.26979005336761475,0.7320250272750854,0.07956977188587189,-2.3985462188720703,0.893799901008606,0.3678738474845886,-0.36194121837615967,0.2515365779399872,1.229640245437622,-0.12377402186393738,-1.2268741130828857,-0.0776534155011177,0.49754956364631653,-0.869475781917572,-0.9973773956298828,-0.04802826792001724,0.19814914464950562,-0.24546006321907043,0.17624755203723907,-0.12185411155223846,-0.47173359990119934,0.8660366535186768,-1.1178853511810303,-0.9997705817222595,1.0096774101257324,-0.18752066791057587,0.045848045498132706,0.6654332280158997,0.6644982099533081,1.3572447299957275,-0.39148062467575073,1.6337687969207764,0.804880678653717,0.45415636897087097,-0.528917133808136,-0.006615892983973026,0.34889519214630127,-0.018262574449181557,0.6119512319564819,1.396559238433838,-1.0835453271865845,-1.6106609106063843,0.43856966495513916,-0.25752049684524536,-1.5533297061920166,-0.25905975699424744,0.11877290904521942,-1.0114094018936157,0.4391430914402008,1.2072490453720093,-0.20339809358119965,-0.34827950596809387,-1.315761923789978,1.0229487419128418,-0.3482910096645355,0.8016973733901978,-0.15759128332138062,1.1359084844589233,0.44285905361175537,-0.4303102493286133,-0.8470547795295715,1.9238499402999878\NYTIMES\Trilobites: A Wet and Warm Spring, Then 200,000 Dead Saigas\2018-01-17 23:41:38.0\
1605\Science\For many mammals, a busy social life can be an important contributor to a long life. But some animals need more alone time than others, and failure to get it could be lethal, according to new research. Consider the marmot. After spending 13 years tracking their interactions and life spans in Colorado, Daniel T. Blumstein, a biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and his colleagues found in a study published Wednesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B that yellow-bellied marmots with more active social lives tended to die younger than those that avoided interactions. “The difference in life span between the most social and the least social marmot was about two years,” said Dr. Blumstein. That’s significant considering that the average life span of a yellow-bellied marmot is about 15 years. Marmots are a genus of large, squirrel-like rodents with sharp claws and furry ears. They are known as socially flexible animals: They prefer to live solitary lives, but will peacefully coexist with each other if the habitat demands it. “The yellow-bellied marmot is more social than other marmots, like the groundhog, but it doesn’t really want to be social,” said Dr. Blumstein. If a yellow-bellied marmot population grows too large, leading to a strain on habitable space, a female yellow-bellied marmot will sometimes allow her daughters to settle nearby, and about half will accept the invitation. (Male offspring always disperse, Dr. Blumstein said.) The marmot social activities the researchers tracked included sitting next to each other, foraging together, playing together and grooming one another. The marmots under observation lived in 11 separate colonies near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Gothic, Colo. Why socializing might be detrimental to a marmot’s health is hard to say. Perhaps, Dr. Blumstein speculated, the animals are passing diseases among themselves. Maybe they are more likely to wake one another during hibernation, causing them to starve in the barren winter forest. Or perhaps time they spend socializing would be better spent looking out for predators. “There are a variety of plausible explanations,” he said. “I just don’t know what they are yet.” [READ: In Winter, You Might Wish You Had This Rodent Superpower] The findings offer a contrast with other mammals. Many studies have shown that highly social animals — humans, dolphins, sheep — live longer if they maintain strong social networks. “For humans, not being social is about as bad as smoking a pack or so of cigarettes a day,” Dr. Blumstein said. Likewise, female baboons that form strong social bonds live longer than those that don’t, as do macaques with larger families. For these animals, social bonds are believed to provide assistance in times of danger and a buffer against stress. In humans, social mores also provide a nudge toward healthier habits, like washing your hands and not eating out of the garbage. [READ: Solitary Pumas Turn Out to Be Mountain Lions Who Lunch] The researchers said that the findings warrant further study into the social habits of seemingly antisocial animals, like pumas and bears. While such animals have earned a reputation for being hostile toward one another, perhaps — knowing that familiarity breeds mortality — their isolation could be driven by a desire to preserve the species.\1.068279504776001,-0.12583163380622864,0.03854924067854881,-0.3581908345222473,-0.34663325548171997,0.8028190732002258,0.10496287792921066,0.1375458985567093,-0.48720645904541016,-0.22550831735134125,0.3967511057853699,0.5720718502998352,-0.7090304493904114,-0.008874047547578812,0.3805321753025055,0.390277236700058,-0.4803723096847534,0.15168984234333038,-0.3025128245353699,-0.41939282417297363,-0.3965977728366852,-0.688180148601532,0.12797734141349792,-0.919369637966156,-0.7641280293464661,0.7619520425796509,0.3678240180015564,-0.1312757134437561,0.31757017970085144,0.20749390125274658,-0.27522510290145874,0.25119978189468384,0.19115124642848969,0.048322707414627075,-0.35021916031837463,-1.1007192134857178,-0.9776116609573364,-0.7946112155914307,0.6205009818077087,0.42549848556518555,0.6377643942832947,-1.817446231842041,1.1332632303237915,-0.22724425792694092,-0.8376874923706055,0.6197078824043274,0.6547500491142273,0.3928062617778778,-0.8614071011543274,-0.4100659191608429,0.28709569573402405,0.3398832678794861,-0.6509624123573303,0.5910055637359619,0.6641480922698975,-0.44812697172164917,0.5622349977493286,-0.5249318480491638,0.0025742233265191317,1.3715415000915527,-0.10795215517282486,-0.6139753460884094,0.543300986289978,-0.08443458378314972,-1.0830628871917725,0.13889998197555542,1.283608317375183,1.2462821006774902,-1.1035252809524536,0.2815926671028137,0.7956470251083374,-0.20830081403255463,0.12800543010234833,0.4241091310977936,0.04765390232205391,-0.1171092838048935,0.2920551300048828,1.088385820388794,-1.501769781112671,-1.4037721157073975,-0.439998984336853,-1.2436391115188599,-1.1826289892196655,0.02792600356042385,0.9818846583366394,-0.915697455406189,0.5665016770362854,-0.45796483755111694,-0.2298000007867813,-0.7985443472862244,-1.3083844184875488,1.4257444143295288,-0.35391998291015625,0.5774184465408325,-0.32946979999542236,0.7300700545310974,0.07170021533966064,-0.40441879630088806,-0.27415892481803894,0.510642409324646\NYTIMES\Trilobites: Being Antisocial Leads to a Longer Life.

1606\Science\A fireball from a descending meteor lit up the sky north of Detroit on Tuesday night, creating a brief spectacle that people across the northern United States and parts of Canada reported seeing. The meteor survived the Earth’s atmosphere and plummeted into view at 8:10 p.m. local time, causing the equivalent of a magnitude 2.0 earthquake, according to the United States Geological Survey. Videos showed a bright flash of light, followed by a pop almost like a light bulb burning out. Some people nearby reported hearing a sonic boom. The American Meteor Society said people as far east as Pittsburgh and as far west as Madison, Wis., reported seeing the fireball. Others reported getting a glimpse in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Missouri and Ontario. “This particular one is probably a once-a-year, maybe three-times-a-year type of fireball,” said Mike Hankey, operations manager for the American Meteor Society. The intensity of the light, and the sound it created, suggested that the meteor was larger than most. While more routine meteors tend to be the size of a golf ball or a baseball, this one was most likely about one to three meters wide, Mr. Hankey said. Almost 50 tons of space material pelts our planet each day, but little of it makes it through the atmosphere, according to NASA. NASA considers any meteor brighter than Venus to be a fireball, and it keeps a database and map of their sightings dating back to 1988.\1.067225694656372,0.2372034639120102,-0.1478438675403595,0.4236776530742645,-0.1675180047750473,0.6973072290420532,-0.25495943427085876,-0.0925431177020073,-0.8425135016441345,0.5416703224182129,0.044169336557388306,0.14835944771766663,-0.38504454493522644,0.20127326250076294,-0.47333693504333496,0.1308843344449997,-0.3965087831020355,0.16949807107448578,-0.2384519726037979,-0.38588187098503113,-0.0183232631534338,-0.34267503023147583,0.5709683895111084,-0.28358685970306396,-0.6157584190368652,0.606760561466217,0.7093934416770935,1.038777232170105,-0.07814996689558029,0.34626278281211853,-0.3081829845905304,0.18276116251945496,0.46049433946609497,0.3827384114265442,0.18834295868873596,-1.1151317358016968,0.03447626158595085,-0.36427542567253113,0.05247845500707626,0.6422768831253052,-0.47344452142715454,0.0897725448012352,1.5148738622665405,0.06319034844636917,-0.08648006618022919,-0.020454946905374527,0.573638916015625,-0.15006044507026672,-0.24180522561073303,-0.8501830697059631,1.0861693620681763,0.31330832839012146,-0.30180346965789795,-0.013620225712656975,0.821675181388855,-0.861907422542572,0.4864761233329773,0.9051056504249573,-0.3621756434440613,1.4472897052764893,0.7205411791801453,-0.5855085849761963,0.7183523178100586,-0.3868386149406433,-0.24201229214668274,-0.02524060755968094,0.25883999466896057,0.8147330284118652,-0.23809021711349487,0.11772449314594269,0.5187423229217529,-0.38067761063575745,-0.6664852499961853,0.9763035774230957,0.3367275893688202,0.18582430481910706,0.2910420894622803,0.4090713560581207,-0.15112774074077606,-0.0969817191362381,0.3359493613243103,-0.46398547291755676,0.1620483696460724,0.71913743019104,0.9406354427337646,-0.7089931964874268,0.0012160383630543947,-0.7078257203102112,0.20038734376430511,-0.5914985537528992,-0.2026611566543579,0.41543057560920715,-0.07236748188734055,-0.7708625793457031,-0.0561399944126606,0.07474440336227417,-0.25986945629119873,-0.16115809977054596,-0.3459540903568268,-0.15007956326007843\NYTIMES\Fireball Cuts Through the Sky Over Michigan as Meteor Falls\2018-01-17 18:59:34.0\
1607\Science\With a nearly impenetrable hide covered in spikes, the ankylosaurus was like a dinosaur version of an armored tank. And like any battlefield behemoth, it boasted a fearsome weapon: a bone-crushing clubbed tail. The ankylosaurus was not the only prehistoric beast to have an intimidating backside. Stegosaurus sported spear-like spikes on its tail. Some sauropods flailed fused clumps of bones from their posteriors toward predators. But in living animals today, formidable tail weaponry is nearly absent. Though porcupines have quills and some lizards lash their tails when threatened, neither animal has the bony armaments seen millions of years ago. To help figure out why, a pair of paleontologists has pieced together a series of traits shared among extinct species that had weaponized their fifth extremity. Their study may help explain why tail weaponry has gone missing since dinosaurs and some ice age animals went extinct. In a paper published Wednesday in the journal Proceeding of the Royal Society B, the team has identified three characteristics in land-dwelling mammals, reptiles and nonavian dinosaurs that may be linked with evolving bony tail weapons. They include being large — about the size of a mountain goat or bigger — eating plants and already having an armored body. “That’s a really rare combination no matter what time period you’re looking at,” said Victoria Arbour, a paleontologist at the University of Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum and an author on the study. Dr. Arbour and her colleague Lindsay Zanno, a paleontologist from North Carolina State University, were sure to note that the three traits they identified are correlated with animals that have tail weapons, and do not drive the development of these dangerous appendages. For the study Dr. Arbour and Dr. Zanno compiled a data set of nearly 300 extinct and living species of mammals, reptiles, birds and dinosaurs. They plugged in characteristics associated with each — like “is herbivorous” or “has a prehensile tail” — into a computer program. After sorting through hundreds of characteristics, they identified the handful most closely shared between species that had tail weapons. Included in the anatomical arsenal were tails that evolved to act like flails, spikes, bats and clubs. The flail was common among long-necked sauropods like the Shunosaurus. On the tip of its tail were large fused bones that could be whipped in self-defense. Stegosaurus and its relatives had spiky, conical bones. And the bat and club were iconic features seen in both ankylosaurus and the glyptodons, which were ancient boulder-sized armadillos. The authors hypothesized that developing bony clubs like the ankylosaurus and the glyptodon was a gradual, evolutionary process. “They start with a stiffening of the tail to make it stronger and able to better project force,” said Dr. Zanno. “You’re swinging with essentially bowling balls at the end of the tails, you’re going to rip it off, so it makes sense that it’s going to happen in that order.” These differed from defenses seen in tails of modern animals because they were made of bone. Living animals tend to have tails with weapons that are made of keratin, like the quills of a porcupine or the scales of a pangolin. Also, modern lizards like iguanas and komodos, which can lash their flexible tails, lack spikes. The exception, the authors noted, was a lizard known as Smaug which does have a smaller bony, spiky tail, they said. Andrew Farke, a paleontologist from the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology at The Webb Schools in California, who was not involved in the study, said the study made a good case. “Lots of animals were big and herbivorous, but only a few groups had bony skin in place already.” he said. “I’m intrigued by the fact that once an animal gets skin armor, there are so many evolutionary pathways toward supporting dangerous tail tips.”\1.7939664125442505,-0.22621527314186096,0.18223270773887634,-1.0662052631378174,-0.7252885103225708,0.6481361985206604,1.1727639436721802,-0.8956791758537292,-0.4177328646183014,-0.8146393299102783,-0.33182835578918457,1.7001153230667114,-0.7598528861999512,-1.31194007396698,-0.595155656337738,1.5745574235916138,-1.118817925453186,0.38043728470802307,-0.36249610781669617,0.6770498752593994,-0.26771852374076843,-0.7845790982246399,0.6298241019248962,-0.44384706020355225,-0.9528177380561829,0.24076029658317566,0.5605801939964294,-0.2860417068004608,0.02332298830151558,0.09698081016540527,-0.19156302511692047,0.6521469354629517,0.2596283257007599,-0.19779375195503235,-0.8343788981437683,-0.8969572186470032,-0.7821248173713684,-0.6287442445755005,-0.5757201910018921,-0.7401907444000244,-0.8239119052886963,-0.7611632347106934,0.7046886086463928,-0.043038394302129745,-1.0507134199142456,0.18889226019382477,1.10520601272583,-0.5913119316101074,-2.6835272312164307,-0.27472561597824097,0.6431845426559448,-0.12064489722251892,-0.5653890371322632,0.43075817823410034,-0.08124661445617676,-0.27440324425697327,0.8116718530654907,-0.05428815633058548,-0.17404673993587494,1.121415615081787,-0.6792429089546204,-0.7022225260734558,-0.49213242530822754,-0.06799200177192688,-0.4200047254562378,0.5738927721977234,1.2738510370254517,1.0368387699127197,-1.4118496179580688,1.093691349029541,0.743774950504303,-0.5366925001144409,-0.8037487268447876,0.09896878898143768,0.0767584815621376,0.06585557013750076,0.4094725251197815,2.1843478679656982,-1.3705331087112427,-0.9707322120666504,0.5409631729125977,-0.08412870764732361,-0.1832711547613144,0.5604663491249084,0.47186583280563354,-0.47830015420913696,-0.3036192059516907,0.6775827407836914,0.9416260123252869,-0.0900849774479866,-0.3664887845516205,0.9892390370368958,-1.0644034147262573,1.0214595794677734,-0.22242777049541473,0.008158985525369644,0.18780843913555145,-0.42777079343795776,-1.1180883646011353,-0.017160817980766296\NYTIMES\Trilobites: Where Did Animals With Tail Weapons Go?

1608\Science\While the lives of squid are mysterious in many ways, one gruesome truth is that after mating comes death. First the male dies. Next the female, after making a little pouch of eggs, begins to starve. “She is unable to feed because the egg mass is in front of the mouth,” explains Henk-Jan Hoving, a deep sea biologist at Geomar Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany. “She probably gets energy from the breakdown of her own tissue, either from the liver or the mental tissue. This is how she stays alive, basically.” Then, once the female is dead and the eggs have hatched, her body will often float to the ocean’s surface and get eaten by birds. But for some species, it appears, the bodies sink. In a paper published recently in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Dr. Hoving and colleagues at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, where he was formerly a researcher, described happening upon the remains of 64 squid and squid egg cases during dives with a remotely operated vehicle or ROV in Mexico’s Gulf of California. If squid in other locations are also found to drift to the bottom like this, they may play a previously unidentified part in the ocean’s role as a storage place for carbon, which could have implications for the study of climate change. Dr. Hoving recalls the 2012 trip when the researchers first realized they were seeing something interesting. “When we visited the bottom of one of the dives with the ROVs, we saw a dead squid and then another one,” he says. Video footage from other outings to the area also showed bodies, they later learned, and in 2015 they returned again, finding more squid carcasses scattered across the floor, some nearly 10,000 feet down. While many dives showed no squid, others were thick with them, as well as crustaceans and sea stars contentedly feeding on some of the remains. Could mating, and thus the slow rain of corpses, be seasonal? We don’t know yet, says Dr. Hoving, but he and collaborators plan to conduct a more standardized survey in the future, perhaps using cameras stationed on the ocean bottom. It’s a question that matters not just for our interest in the personal lives of squid, but also for understanding how the oceans, by far the world’s largest storage place of carbon, perform that role. The researchers now estimate that at least in parts of the Gulf of California, squid may add up to about 12 milligrams of carbon per square meter per day on the ocean floor. That is a significant amount, about half of what gets stored by the incessant fall of tiny plankton bodies at shallower, better studied depths. Squid populations are presently exploding, researchers now know, perhaps because of warming oceans or because humans have depleted fish that prey on them. Understanding just how they contribute to the sequestering of carbon in the oceans will add important details to our picture of the planet.\0.7144851088523865,0.23267456889152527,-1.0119248628616333,0.23952235281467438,-0.7446088790893555,0.5650095343589783,0.537285566329956,-0.2715955674648285,-1.2705786228179932,0.02225944958627224,0.2015230804681778,1.0008193254470825,-0.3964989185333252,0.6605530977249146,-0.4310837686061859,0.4295758903026581,0.08623111248016357,0.2782229781150818,-0.050888217985630035,-0.05963538587093353,-0.5477516651153564,0.4870472848415375,0.8486418724060059,-1.26409912109375,-0.7852074503898621,-0.5112239122390747,0.4981953799724579,0.16853588819503784,-0.010847766883671284,-0.523353636264801,-0.37008389830589294,1.344445824623108,-0.5138283967971802,-0.7955410480499268,0.35523292422294617,-0.08222361654043198,-0.2637682855129242,0.40746009349823,-0.14163930714130402,0.0700259655714035,-0.06872491538524628,-0.4968189299106598,0.4390513002872467,0.15686877071857452,-0.1799759566783905,0.7250669598579407,0.03388679027557373,-0.5049163699150085,-0.816013514995575,-1.839375615119934,0.7765865325927734,-0.03738673776388168,-1.798465609550476,-0.035557251423597336,0.915839433670044,-0.6733601093292236,0.7069214582443237,0.5747276544570923,0.3637908101081848,0.6283999085426331,0.5859643220901489,-0.07020805031061172,-0.17107132077217102,-0.31236085295677185,-0.4044179320335388,-0.08703957498073578,0.09935297071933746,0.9323269724845886,-0.33681708574295044,-0.003141348250210285,-0.12334784865379333,0.8271027207374573,-0.007770952302962542,-0.018207378685474396,0.026027943938970566,-0.16046614944934845,-0.2842906415462494,0.13364256918430328,-1.0307615995407104,-0.8450270295143127,0.27611997723579407,-0.2206714153289795,-0.7583005428314209,0.9047216176986694,-0.09490039944648743,-0.6457242369651794,1.2826653718948364,0.21370255947113037,-0.372406542301178,-0.15983936190605164,-1.728545904159546,0.9274027347564697,-0.2043703943490982,-0.7153878808021545,0.2619667649269104,1.2562474012374878,0.49257323145866394,0.1663748323917389,0.19232666492462158,0.6220242381095886\NYTIMES\Trilobites: The Squid That Sink to the Ocean’s Floor When They Die\2018-01-13 10:30:25.0\
1609\Science\The government of Switzerland kicked off a debate this week when it ordered that lobsters and other crustaceans no longer be dropped alive into boiling water. Boiling them causes pain, the government said, and should be replaced by a more rapid method of death — such as stunning. Still, even the scientist who conducted the foundational research for the government’s decision said he’s not 100 percent sure that lobsters can feel pain. But he’s concerned enough that he’s only cooked a live lobster once and doesn’t plan to do it again. “There’s no absolute proof, but you keep running experiments and almost everything I looked at came out consistent with the idea of pain in these animals,” said Robert Elwood, professor emeritus of animal behavior at Queen’s University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. “There should be a more humane approach with lobsters.” Dr. Elwood’s position — and the Swiss government’s — is outside the scientific mainstream, said Joseph Ayers, a professor of marine and environmental sciences at Northeastern University in Boston. “I think the idea of producing such a law is just a bunch of people anthropomorphizing lobsters,” Dr. Ayers said, adding that there were other possible explanations for Dr. Elwood’s findings. “I find it really quite remarkable that people attribute to these animals humanlike responses when they simply don’t have the hardware for it.” Lobsters lack the brain anatomy needed to feel pain, said Dr. Ayers, who builds robots modeled on lobster and sea lamprey neurobiology. Lobsters and other crustaceans are often swallowed whole by predators, he added, so they never needed to evolve the ability to detect pain from say, warming water or an electric shock. Michael Tlusty, a lobster biologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston, takes a middle ground. He agrees that lobsters lack the brain anatomy that we associate with pain sensation. But crustacean brains are so different from ours, he said, that no one can really say for certain what they are feeling. For instance, when a lobster’s claw is being attacked, it will jettison its own arm to escape. “When a human does that, we make a movie about it,” Dr. Tlusty said, referring to the 2010 survival drama “127 Hours.” Lobsters continue to twitch after they’ve had their limbs ripped off, he noted, but it’s unclear whether that’s in response to unpleasant sensations or a programmed reflex — like your leg kicking when a doctor taps your knee in a particular place. Dr. Elwood got the idea for researching lobster pain about a dozen years ago at his local pub. Celebrity chef Rick Stein, known for his seafood dishes, was having a pint, and Dr. Elwood introduced himself. The chef stumped him by asking if lobsters felt pain when cooked. In several studies since, Dr. Elwood has shown that crustaceans guard wounded limbs and avoid areas where they’ve been shocked — even leaving their shells behind if necessary. When he traveled to Singapore, he said he watched as street sellers kept grabbing live crabs as they scuttled off a barbecue grill, keen to get away. He’s now convinced that those responses are the crustacean equivalent of pain. As David Foster Wallace observed in his famous article “Consider the Lobster,” lobsters remain the only animals we still kill in our own kitchens. We have to face the ethics of that decision, he noted, while we more easily ignore such feelings about other animals in our diet. Boiling might take as long as a minute to kill a lobster, long enough for it to suffer, Dr. Elwood said. A skilled chef who slices right into a lobster’s head should be able to kill the animal faster, he said. “That should be a reasonable way of doing it.” He also mentioned a commercial device called a Crustastun that zaps the animal with electricity, promising to kill it instantly. The Swiss government cited electrocution as a preferred method of killing, though the Crustastun, which reportedly costs $3,400, is meant to be used by processors or large restaurants. Dr. Ayers dismissed the method, saying he’s seen animals moving for minutes after being stunned. He said he loves lobsters as much as anyone — he’s devoted his career to studying them, and his son is a lobster fisherman — but he said he doesn’t see a more humane way of killing lobsters than dunking them headfirst into a pot of boiling water. Dr. Tlusty has an alternative strategy: He puts lobsters on ice to slow their nervous system before they meet the pot.\0.18616066873073578,0.41685840487480164,-0.15271860361099243,-0.38250207901000977,-0.14655977487564087,1.1058902740478516,0.9940965175628662,0.5437896847724915,-1.2229477167129517,-1.0501127243041992,0.10409317165613174,1.81500244140625,-0.3245461881160736,1.1069992780685425,-0.8040317296981812,0.874549150466919,-0.972088634967804,-0.013505437411367893,0.26097381114959717,-0.09143773466348648,-0.1568007916212082,-1.1922787427902222,1.8381092548370361,-1.4043527841567993,0.06582710146903992,0.7814911603927612,0.4721048176288605,-0.170750692486763,-0.19632099568843842,-0.1548425257205963,0.26281529664993286,1.482046127319336,1.1904479265213013,-0.40789398550987244,-0.5824061632156372,-0.727197527885437,0.042491089552640915,-0.2820836305618286,-0.3830180764198303,-0.06934724003076553,-0.6620585322380066,-0.3918903172016144,0.6757181882858276,-0.5268747806549072,-0.25288063287734985,-0.17963100969791412,0.37408655881881714,-0.3013346791267395,-1.7286436557769775,0.7871519923210144,1.382772445678711,-0.993593692779541,-1.310200810432434,0.7898984551429749,0.8575728535652161,-0.035491712391376495,1.3450570106506348,0.5080713629722595,-0.7762812972068787,0.9314174056053162,-0.11109267175197601,-0.5357562303543091,-0.15105052292346954,-0.7202802896499634,-0.40176814794540405,-0.011522914282977581,0.3946962356567383,0.9226873517036438,-0.8138364553451538,0.20986329019069672,1.36996591091156,0.01596170663833618,0.43766194581985474,1.1503705978393555,-1.445713996887207,0.4193677306175232,-1.0504204034805298,0.28866735100746155,-1.4766829013824463,-0.8780787587165833,0.11807611584663391,-0.47889578342437744,-1.119857668876648,1.3186701536178589,-0.8779930472373962,-0.24940571188926697,0.9341589212417603,-0.9167389869689941,0.7761861085891724,0.45895859599113464,-0.2587101459503174,1.1074786186218262,-1.8338412046432495,-0.18374191224575043,0.5344650149345398,-0.11023290455341339,-0.07411407679319382,-0.779701292514801,-1.411421298980713,0.5597089529037476\NYTIMES\Trilobites: The Swiss Consider the Lobster.

1610\Science\Humans, chimpanzees, elephants, magpies and bottle-nosed dolphins can recognize themselves in a mirror, according to scientific reports, although as any human past age 50 knows, that first glance in the morning may yield ambiguous results. Not to worry. Scientists are talking about species-wide abilities, not the fact that one’s father or mother makes unpredictable appearances in the looking glass. Mirror self-recognition is often taken as a measure of a kind of intelligence and self-awareness, although not all scientists agree. And researchers have wondered not only about which species display this ability, but about when it emerges during early development. Children start showing signs of self-recognition at about 12 months at the earliest and chimpanzees at two years old. But dolphins, researchers reported Wednesday, start mugging for the mirror as early as seven months, earlier than humans. Diana Reiss a psychologist at Hunter College, and Rachel Morrison, then a graduate student working with Reiss, studied two young dolphins over three years at the National Aquarium in Baltimore. Dr. Reiss first reported self-recognition in dolphins in 2001 with Lori Marino, now the head of The Kimmela Center for Animal Advocacy. She and Dr. Morrison, now an assistant professor in the psychology department at the University of North Carolina Pembroke collaborated on the study and published their findings in the journal PLoS One. Dr. Reiss said the timing of the emergence of self-recognition is significant, because in human children the ability has been tied to other milestones of physical and social development. Since dolphins develop earlier than humans in those areas, the researchers predicted that dolphins should show self-awareness earlier. Seven months was when Bayley, a female, started showing self-directed behavior, like twirling and taking unusual poses. Dr. Reiss said dolphins “may put their eye right up against the mirror and look in silence. They may look at the insides of their mouths and wiggle their tongues.” Foster, the male, was almost 14 months when the study started. He had a particular fondness for turning upside down and blowing bubbles in front of the one-way mirror in the aquarium wall through which the researchers observed and recorded what the dolphins were doing. The animals also passed a test in which the researchers drew a mark on some part of the dolphin’s body it could not see without a mirror. In this so-called mark test, the animal must notice and pay attention to the mark. Animals with hands point at the mark and may touch it. The dolphins passed that test at 24 months, which was the earliest researchers were allowed to draw on the young animals. Rules for animal care prohibited the test at an earlier age because of a desire to have the animals develop unimpeded. During testing, the young animals were always with the group of adults they live with, and only approached a one-way mirror in the aquarium wall when they felt like it. Rules for drawing on human children are apparently less strict, and they pass the mark test at 18-24 months. Frans de Waal, of Emory University, who studies cognition in apes and other animals and is the author of “Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?” , said in an email, “Great study.” Dr. de Waal worked with Dr. Reiss on an earlier study of self-recognition in elephants but was not involved in the dolphin research. He said the study has value because science needs to go beyond asking whether species display mirror self-recognition (MSR) to ask “whether the emergence of MSR correlates, as it does in humans, with other milestones of development.” Connecting the ability to the rest of development can help researchers “begin to answer the question of what MSR means.” A small side note that doesn’t have any apparent scientific significance is that Foster, the male, visited the mirror many more times than Bayley, the female. “He clearly was interested in viewing himself,” Dr. Reiss said.\0.6081128120422363,0.5980448722839355,-0.5907109975814819,0.1483212560415268,0.06465601176023483,0.6903426051139832,0.7184337973594666,-0.5403104424476624,-0.6737862825393677,-1.2623848915100098,-0.01438866276293993,1.4309916496276855,-0.23006536066532135,1.654869794845581,-0.46961313486099243,-0.09775234013795853,-0.8152417540550232,-0.05088495463132858,-0.14967569708824158,1.4129180908203125,0.4149448573589325,0.2213849276304245,0.8062772154808044,-0.030390990898013115,-0.3016290068626404,-0.4294114410877228,0.2740384340286255,-0.27263620495796204,0.2427791804075241,0.8796586990356445,-0.7451094388961792,0.329917848110199,-0.036283113062381744,-0.19634413719177246,-0.41448062658309937,-0.3069981038570404,-0.3173096179962158,-0.6493152379989624,0.19857950508594513,0.14652808010578156,-0.40632912516593933,-2.1735341548919678,1.3357326984405518,0.25573059916496277,-0.6605373024940491,-0.20390474796295166,-0.12897475063800812,-0.5158606171607971,-1.3514821529388428,0.22248955070972443,0.9022342562675476,-0.5900920033454895,-0.9151090383529663,0.6011680960655212,-0.08135836571455002,-1.0247375965118408,1.2002015113830566,0.35186824202537537,-0.3614059090614319,0.3998366892337799,-0.9109150171279907,0.7126055955886841,0.06452542543411255,-0.5932565927505493,-0.6068811416625977,0.7183372378349304,0.38367223739624023,1.1043659448623657,-1.575279712677002,1.7289361953735352,0.4947039484977722,0.10678281635046005,-0.42850419878959656,-0.45864030718803406,0.6781455874443054,0.3476965129375458,-0.10210304707288742,0.08670508116483688,-1.205581784248352,-1.5537549257278442,0.052603673189878464,0.02678835391998291,-0.7649030089378357,0.38473689556121826,0.35109028220176697,-0.41186925768852234,-0.09488202631473541,-0.19908064603805542,0.07576282322406769,-0.4622167944908142,-1.4616090059280396,0.30381059646606445,-0.3806971609592438,0.4166060984134674,-0.601286768913269,0.9789971709251404,-0.0633874237537384,-0.45963144302368164,0.08560141921043396,0.022809244692325592\NYTIMES\ScienceTake: Dolphins Show Self-Recognition Earlier Than Children\2018-01-16 04:21:35.0\
1611\Science\On Dec. 26, 2004, a magnitude 9.1 earthquake ruptured the ocean floor off the west coast of Sumatra. The resulting tsunami killed nearly 230,000 people in 14 countries, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in history. And it occurred during a full moon. The Sumatra earthquake isn’t the only large earthquake to have occurred beneath the moon’s bright glare. Both the earthquake that devastated Chile in 2010 and the Great Alaskan Earthquake in 1964 also happened on a conspicuous lunar date — making it tempting to argue that more large earthquakes occur during the full moon. But a new study published in Seismological Research Letters finds that the connection is nothing but folklore. To analyze the supposed link, Susan Hough, a seismologist at the United States Geological Survey, scrutinized 204 earthquakes of magnitude 8 or greater over the past four centuries. She then matched those earthquakes to the lunar calendar and found that no more occurred during a full or new moon than on any other day of the lunar cycle. “The lore that the big earthquakes happen during the full moon — there’s no support for that in the catalog,” Dr. Hough said. There is some sound science connecting Earth’s temblors and the moon. That’s because during full and new moons, Earth, the sun and the moon fall along a nearly straight line. This celestial alignment tugs at our planet, raising tides in the oceans and in the solid earth. That effect is far too weak to cause an earthquake on its own. But should the moon’s gravitational pull tug at a fault that is dangerously close to rupture, a temblor is not impossible. “It’s not some wild crazy idea,” Dr. Hough said. But the gravitational effect is vanishingly small and only occurs under narrow circumstances, so it would never translate into a pronounced force — certainly not one that can be seen in a calendar or used to make predictions. In 2004, for example, Elizabeth Cochran, a geophysicist with the U.S.G.S. who was not involved in this study, and her colleagues published a study that did show a slight increase in the number of earthquakes during low tides — but only those in deep ocean basins. Two years ago, a study by Satoshi Ide, a seismologist at the University of Tokyo, and his colleagues made headlines when it suggested that the number of high-magnitude earthquakes (like the one that occurred in Sumatra) also increases slightly as tidal stresses rise. But again, this effect is so small that the probability an earthquake will occur during any given full moon remains no different than on any other day of the lunar cycle. Such a minute change doesn’t help scientists predict when large earthquakes might occur, nor does it help regular citizens and emergency responders. There is simply too little power in the lunar tides. In short, Dr. Hough’s study “debunks the prevalent superstition some people have that the moon tells us something about the danger,” said John Vidale, a seismologist at the University of Southern California who directs the Southern California Earthquake Center and was not involved in the new study. Unfortunately, Dr. Hough doesn’t think the superstition will disappear anytime soon. But she hopes that studies like this can slowly chip away at the misconceptions, helping the public eventually realize that, no, the next full moon will not spawn a series of apocalyptic earthquakes.\0.6005784273147583,-0.14548924565315247,-0.48909324407577515,0.24844080209732056,-0.118368960916996,0.6434761881828308,0.7899482250213623,0.3655886948108673,-1.256881833076477,-0.7685959339141846,0.6945083141326904,1.7166858911514282,-1.2961962223052979,0.4539918601512909,-0.9788370132446289,0.007177980616688728,0.042140353471040726,0.4922668933868408,-0.2517555058002472,0.13601277768611908,-0.4219069480895996,0.5833608508110046,-0.4894413948059082,-1.0407620668411255,-0.01862350106239319,0.05173838883638382,1.641540765762329,0.5383579730987549,0.24012775719165802,0.031645726412534714,0.03449367359280586,1.2253003120422363,-0.49414604902267456,1.882397174835205,-0.6483575105667114,0.221791073679924,-0.4717714190483093,-0.09870335459709167,-0.5098459720611572,-0.2589848041534424,-0.3629319369792938,-1.1569246053695679,0.3957459628582001,-0.8284313082695007,-0.43659520149230957,0.4321984648704529,0.945209264755249,-0.1217244565486908,0.3110525608062744,0.5033384561538696,1.6078152656555176,-0.700778067111969,-0.35545992851257324,0.1015191376209259,0.6970927119255066,0.07967419177293777,1.39778470993042,1.1443549394607544,-0.2762860655784607,1.3612451553344727,-0.09518668055534363,-0.17334263026714325,0.6023995876312256,-0.49191999435424805,-0.6833792924880981,0.36420196294784546,0.9394279718399048,1.714858889579773,-0.8368152976036072,1.1563985347747803,1.025010108947754,1.4516980648040771,-0.053265441209077835,-0.762804388999939,-0.4296081066131592,-0.31705141067504883,-0.5447190999984741,-0.2928154468536377,-0.25411462783813477,-1.670936107635498,0.9620198607444763,-0.7971037030220032,-1.3082231283187866,-0.5457854270935059,0.021482469514012337,-0.5157560706138611,1.1314879655838013,-0.36595287919044495,-0.8347678184509277,-0.7103142142295837,-1.1370644569396973,0.8395622968673706,0.3323211371898651,0.3558720648288727,0.2825472950935364,1.642346978187561,-0.051094118505716324,0.19265992939472198,-0.35993555188179016,0.4873088300228119\NYTIMES\Trilobites: Are Earthquakes More Likely During Full Moons?

1612\Science\At the moment, the 2017-2018 flu season is considered “moderately severe.” Large numbers of Americans have fallen ill, and every state except Hawaii has reported widespread flu activity. But some regions have been hit harder than others. More important, the number of people hospitalized or dying from flu nationwide is not unusually high. This season is closely paralleling the 2014-2015 season, which was dominated by the same H3N2 flu strain and was also “moderately severe.” H3N2 is the most dangerous of the four seasonal flu strains, but it is not new nor uniquely lethal. A typical season mixes two Type A strains — H1N1 and H3N2, and two Type B strains — Victoria and Yamagata. (The B strains normally arrive later and are rarer.) As of Jan. 7, about 78 percent of all samples genetically sequenced have been H3N2, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That strain first emerged in Hong Kong in 1968 and killed an estimated 1 million people around the world that year. But it has circulated ever since, constantly undergoing small mutations. Many people have had it, and an H3N2 strain is a component of every season’s flu shot, so partial immunity is widespread. Almost 6 percent of all Americans seeking medical care now have flu symptoms. That is tracked by the C.D.C.’s Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network, to which about 2,000 doctors’ offices and clinics around the country report weekly how many of their patients have fevers of at least 100 degrees plus a cough or sore throat. The 2014-15 and 2012-13 flu seasons also peaked at close to 6 percent. By contrast, the mildest recent season, 2011-2012, barely surpassed 2 percent. In 2009, during the H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic, almost 8 percent of visits were flu-related, but they peaked in October, not in January. That never happens in seasonal flu but is typical of pandemic flus. In some places, including Southern California and central Texas, some hospitals have seen so many flu patients that they had to set up triage tents or turn other patients away. But overall there have not been reports of regional shortages of antiviral medications, patients dying because a city ran out of respirators, or other signs of a major crisis. This year’s outbreak began in Louisiana and Mississippi, then spread across Texas to California and up the West Coast from San Diego to Seattle. It also stretched into the Midwest. Kinsahealth, which makes internet-connected thermometers and builds its database from 25,000 daily fever readings, says the current hot spot is the St. Louis area. The Northeast has been largely spared so far, as have Minnesota, the Dakotas and some Rocky Mountain states. No, although it may appear so right now. The deaths of a few apparently healthy people — notably those of a 21-year-old fitness buff in Latrobe, Pa., a mother of three in San Jose, Calif., and a 10-year-old hockey player in New Canaan, Conn. — have been widely publicized, and some areas, like San Diego, have reported record numbers of deaths. But it is still too early to say how high mortality will be nationally. It can take weeks to confirm all flu-related deaths. As of now, the mortality rate for victims under age 18, a bellwether C.D.C. category, is well below that seen in the 2014-15 season. Even in a mild year, flu kills about 12,000 Americans, the C.D.C. estimates. In a bad year, it kills up to 56,000. Most of those deaths are among the elderly, but flu also kills middle-aged adults with underlying problems like heart or lung disease, diabetes, immune suppression or obesity. It is also dangerous for pregnant women, children under age 5 and children with asthma. And, every season, flu and its complications, including pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis, kill some apparently healthy people. Its H3N2 component is a bad match for the circulating strain. Australia just had a severe flu season with many deaths, and the vaccine there had the same mismatch. Experts estimated that the vaccine prevented infection only 10 percent of the time. The shot’s efficacy here has not yet been calculated because the virus is still spreading, but experts expect it to be about 30 percent. In Australia, vaccination failed partially because it is urged for only the most vulnerable, while in the United States millions of healthy people are vaccinated. Experts say yes, because even when the shot does not prevent you from catching the flu, it may save you from dying of it. And while getting it in October is best, because it takes about two weeks to build immunity, it is still not too late, because the virus persists all winter and into spring. Yes. Of all the samples tested so far by the C.D.C., only 1 percent were resistant to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir, the ingredients in Tamiflu, Relenza and Rapivab. But to be effective, these medicines should be taken as early as possible after symptoms appear. (Rapivab is given intravenously, usually in hospitals.)\1.8566524982452393,-0.48756396770477295,-0.42778193950653076,0.7394933700561523,-1.8444350957870483,0.37287425994873047,-0.6122134327888489,-1.1868737936019897,-0.4174063205718994,0.9071320295333862,1.1040780544281006,1.3124451637268066,-1.8714603185653687,0.9875631928443909,-1.647346019744873,0.3968079686164856,0.17602990567684174,0.6669387817382812,-0.04589714854955673,0.5145257115364075,0.7651204466819763,1.2218432426452637,-0.008917845785617828,-0.3987216353416443,1.132876992225647,0.48354095220565796,1.0282998085021973,-0.31002339720726013,-0.40756282210350037,0.9998142123222351,-0.14235326647758484,0.11460774391889572,-0.4001486301422119,0.6747094988822937,0.24673156440258026,-0.970126748085022,0.985811173915863,0.6732248067855835,-0.24329014122486115,0.331358402967453,0.6690989136695862,-1.5609285831451416,0.49643343687057495,0.8424784541130066,1.2603024244308472,0.3741745054721832,1.3676265478134155,0.855922520160675,-1.6842918395996094,-0.6988318562507629,1.1145009994506836,-0.3221852779388428,-0.6506932973861694,-0.07720533013343811,0.565427303314209,-0.07372310757637024,1.3943455219268799,0.6872357726097107,0.17589855194091797,0.21070413291454315,1.3666120767593384,-0.9823800921440125,0.18955691158771515,-0.1673026829957962,0.04623560979962349,0.2093389928340912,0.7077544927597046,2.2374279499053955,-2.1457197666168213,0.2722308337688446,1.4784512519836426,0.0944533497095108,-1.2616465091705322,0.21570010483264923,0.12327026575803757,-2.099364757537842,0.8228394985198975,0.9222698211669922,-0.5561398267745972,-1.1390081644058228,-0.3498955965042114,-0.7866161465644836,-0.9193689227104187,1.5454494953155518,-0.19530364871025085,-2.086820363998413,0.5610752105712891,1.0609239339828491,0.7200711965560913,0.923466682434082,-1.1284925937652588,0.19305263459682465,-0.769510805606842,-0.2285575419664383,-0.2492254376411438,1.66746187210083,0.12933959066867828,-0.9692392349243164,-1.3604568243026733,1.0544108152389526\NYTIMES\Questions and Answers About This Year’s Flu Season\2018-01-18 15:25:21.0\
1613\Science\For years, hospital executives have expressed frustration when essential drugs like heart medicines have become scarce, or when prices have skyrocketed because investors manipulated the market. Now, some of the country’s largest hospital systems are taking an aggressive step to combat the problem: They plan to go into the drug business themselves, in a move that appears to be the first on this scale. “This is a shot across the bow of the bad guys,” said Dr. Marc Harrison, the chief executive of Intermountain Healthcare, the nonprofit Salt Lake City hospital group that is spearheading the effort. “We are not going to lay down. We are going to go ahead and try and fix it.” While Intermountain executives would not name the drugs they intend to make, hospitals have long experienced shortages of drugs like morphine or encountered sudden price increases for old, off-patent products like the heart medicine Nitropress. Hospitals have also come under criticism for overcharging for their services, including for some drugs. Several major hospital systems, including Ascension, a Catholic system that is the nation’s largest nonprofit hospital group, plan to form a new nonprofit company, that will provide a number of generic drugs to the hospitals. The Department of Veterans Affairs is also expressing interest in participating. In all, about 300 hospitals are now included in the group. Other hospitals are expected to join. Dr. Harrison said they planned to focus only on certain drugs. “There are individual places where there are problems,” he said. “We are not indicting an entire industry.” Dr. Kevin A. Schulman, a professor of medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine who has studied the generic drug market and is advising the effort, said: “If they all agree to buy enough to sustain this effort, you will have a huge threat to people that are trying to manipulate the generic drug market. They will want to think twice.” The idea is to directly challenge the host of industry players who have capitalized on certain markets, buying up monopolies of old, off-patent drugs and then sharply raising prices, stoking public outrage and prompting a series of Congressional hearings and federal investigations. The most notorious example is of Martin Shkreli, the former hedge fund manager who raised the price of a decades-old drug, Daraprim, to $750 a tablet in 2015, from $13.50. Hospitals have also struggled to deal with shortages of hundreds of vital drugs over the past decade, ranging from injectable morphine to sodium bicarbonate (the medical form of baking soda), shortfalls that are exacerbated when only one or two manufacturers make the product. “We’re seeing an acceleration of both shortages and escalation of prices,” said Dr. Richard Gilfillan, the chief executive of Trinity Health, a large Catholic system that operates in nearly two dozen states and is part of the group. “There’s not been any effective push back on either of these.” Intermountain executives would not discuss many details of the project, citing fears that competitors could shut them out of the market by quickly dropping the price of the drugs in question, then raising them again later. They said they would focus on drugs whose prices have risen sharply or that have been in short supply. “We’re going to have to hold that very close to our vest,” Dr. Harrison said. The company will either rely on third-party manufacturers or decide to make the drugs themselves. The new company will initially focus on selling to hospitals, but officials said they may eventually expand to offer the products more broadly. Dr. Carolyn Clancy, the executive in charge of the Veterans Health Administration, said its pharmacy experts have consulted with the other systems about the project and is now working out the details of its possible involvement. “Our strong interest here is minimizing the impact of any shortages of generic drugs,” she said. While she said the agency is able to negotiate good prices for veterans, “we don’t necessarily control supply” and have experienced many of the same shortages, including the recent lack of saline fluids, as the other health groups. “We are constantly scanning the horizon and constantly attentive to interruptions of supply chains of medicines,” she said. In addition to Daraprim, several old, off-patent drugs have seen sharp price increases over the past several years. In 2015, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International became a Wall Street darling after it sold investors on its business model of buying up old drugs, then raising the prices precipitously. That year, it sharply raised the prices of two heart drugs, Nitropress and Isuprel, adding millions to hospitals’ drug bills almost overnight. Valeant’s practices led to a series of investigations and Congressional hearings as well as a shake-up of the company’s leadership. Representatives for the generic drug industry have noted that many of the most high-profile cases have involved old, off-patent drugs for which there has been no generic competition. The trade group for generic manufacturers, the Association for Accessible Medicines, said its members generally welcome competition. “The whole generic industry is premised on competition, and that competition brings dramatic savings for patients,” said Allen Goldberg, a spokesman for the group. But generic drug makers have also come under scrutiny. The hike in the price of doxycycline hyclate, an antibiotic, which increased to $3.65 a pill in 2013 from 5.6 cents in 2012, led to a congressional investigation as well as state and federal price-fixing inquiries into some of the industry’s biggest players. Last fall, a coalition of state attorneys general broadened a lawsuit over price fixing, accusing 18 companies of engaging in illegal practices involving 15 drugs. Anthony R. Tersigni, the chief executive of Ascension, said he and other hospital executives felt they had little choice but to try to solve the problem themselves. “We took the position collectively rather than waiting and hoping for the generic drug companies to address it,” he said. “We have to address it head on.” Intermountain executives said that they would seek approval to manufacture the products from the Food and Drug Administration, which has vowed to give priority to companies that want to make generics in markets for which there is little competition. The project boasts a high-profile list of advisers, ranging from Bob Kerrey, the former Democratic senator of Nebraska, to Dr. Donald Berwick, a former administrator for the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as two former executives with Amgen, the drug manufacturer. Erin Fox, a drug shortage expert at the University of Utah, said the idea of creating a nonprofit drug company is promising. “I think anything that increases the number of suppliers will help,” she said. She added that the trick will be in selecting the right third-party manufacturer to ensure good quality.\0.7584566473960876,0.9685458540916443,-1.1045219898223877,-1.1454137563705444,2.1085548400878906,0.6371453404426575,0.43500155210494995,0.24175482988357544,-0.8529587984085083,0.003535905387252569,0.3669317066669464,0.7228320240974426,-1.138948678970337,-0.5919196605682373,-0.5180417895317078,-0.6107770800590515,-0.790240466594696,-0.5333413481712341,-0.7676439881324768,-0.9542939066886902,-0.35691553354263306,-0.41854745149612427,1.0695443153381348,-0.43395379185676575,0.3804350793361664,0.3837672173976898,-0.6491994857788086,-0.742567241191864,-0.4064561724662781,-0.9566940069198608,-0.5185118317604065,1.1793968677520752,-0.24426352977752686,-1.7360361814498901,-0.7294349670410156,-1.362766146659851,-1.1795217990875244,-1.313931941986084,0.8518306612968445,-0.3029545247554779,-0.348985493183136,-0.6604433059692383,0.11630651354789734,-0.084032341837883,-1.2754899263381958,0.5065283179283142,-1.1260207891464233,-0.5670002102851868,-0.14307890832424164,0.3216168284416199,0.4108238220214844,-0.18535199761390686,0.1841326504945755,0.5711390972137451,-0.23050709068775177,-0.9242333769798279,0.2335742563009262,-0.9684560298919678,-1.394615650177002,0.14133520424365997,-0.17956699430942535,-0.44531604647636414,-1.4417834281921387,-0.6261771321296692,-0.9561029076576233,0.4477536678314209,0.07054799050092697,1.3038220405578613,-0.7894157767295837,-0.24890752136707306,0.5716196894645691,-0.12518014013767242,-1.8783835172653198,-0.8300963640213013,-0.06781704723834991,0.8419076800346375,0.9344120621681213,-0.5307899117469788,-1.8569309711456299,-0.18557462096214294,-0.476144939661026,1.2134878635406494,-1.0907816886901855,1.7052894830703735,0.5458868145942688,0.555622398853302,0.472805380821228,0.6624360084533691,-0.3118487596511841,-0.8314775228500366,-0.6531788110733032,1.5355740785598755,0.5467697978019714,0.9876948595046997,-1.4116666316986084,0.8870744705200195,0.15589167177677155,-0.11563290655612946,-3.0638067722320557,-0.003721974790096283\NYTIMES\Fed Up With Drug Companies, Hospitals Decide to Start Their Own\2018-01-18 06:01:20.0\
1614\Science\Early on Saturday, amid blowing snow and temperatures at minus 13 Fahrenheit, three caribou were blindfolded, earplugged and bundled into a helicopter on an island in Lake Superior. The animals, survivors of a herd that was decimated by wolves in recent years, were among nine animals relocated by the Ontario government last weekend in an attempt to save them from disappearing from around Lake Superior, where they once thrived. A team of pilots, veterinarians, research scientists and animal handlers moved eight cows and one bull from Michipicoten Island to the Slate Islands some 80 miles away, where the government hopes the animals will have a chance to repopulate. After being herded by helicopter to an open area on Michipicoten Island, the caribou were captured with a gun net, restrained and sedated. Loaded on another helicopter, they took an hourlong ride to their new home. The flying conditions were challenging, said Arthur Rodgers, a government research scientist and biology lecturer at Lakehead University who helped lead the relocation. “It was a pretty hairy ride,” he said. “I almost wish I had been sedated for part of it.” But the caribou “transported very well,” Dr. Rodgers said. Michipicoten Island’s caribou population has dropped from the hundreds to fewer than 40 animals since 2013, according to Ontario’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. In the winters from 2013 to 2015, packs of wolves crossed ice bridges from the mainland to the island, where they hunted caribou. Historically, ice bridges would have formed almost every winter, giving both wolves and caribou freedom to move around, said Gordon Eason, a retired biologist who worked with the ministry for three decades. But because of global warming, he said, those bridges now form only occasionally, trapping the caribou on islands, together with their predators. “It’s like being confined in a prison cell with someone who’s trying to murder you,” Mr. Eason said. Caribou-transplant operations are not unheard-of on Lake Superior. In the early 1980s, after a lighthouse keeper noticed the tracks of a lone bull who had crossed an ice bridge to Michipicoten Island, Mr. Eason and his colleagues hauled seven females (and an extra male) to the island to join him, in the hopes of creating a new community. It worked — at least for a few decades. Dr. Rodgers and a colleague, Brent Patterson, a government research scientist and adjunct professor at Trent University in Ontario, said they were optimistic about the fate of Michipicoten Island’s caribou. But other scientists feared they would be killed by wolves in the next few weeks. Serge Couturier, a biologist who has been studying caribou for 34 years, said it was “likely” that wolves would “take the last few caribou before the end of the snow period.” Mr. Eason, who led the original caribou relocation to Michipicoten Island, is among those calling for the ministry to do more to save Lake Superior’s caribou. “We have to become that agent of immigration instead of just natural immigration occurring,” he said. “I guess that’s one of the costs of managing threatened species or endangered species,” he added. “You have to intervene in part of the cycle that isn’t functioning anymore.” The relocation comes after months of complaints from people who live nearby on Lake Superior, who have long voiced concerns about the island’s caribou and at one point even considered culling the wolves themselves. “We wanted to keep the caribou on Michipicoten; it’s an incredible habitat, and they’ve thrived there,” said Leo Lepiano, the lands and resources coordinator for the Michipicoten First Nation, a group representing the native community. Now, some people are calling for the ministry to move the remaining Michipicoten caribou to other islands as “backup” populations. “As it stands now, the survival of the Lake Superior caribou will be entirely dependent on the animals on the Slate Islands,” Mr. Lepiano, Mr. Eason and others wrote in a letter sent to the ministry on Monday. Mr. Lepiano said he was concerned another ice bridge could form from the mainland to the Slate Islands. “It’s possible that wolves could make it over to the Slate Islands, and it would only take them a couple of weeks to eat through the caribou,” he said. “It’s kind of foolish to put all your eggs in one basket.”\1.545488953590393,0.8596845269203186,-0.07358212023973465,0.1619100719690323,-0.11124283075332642,-0.13868053257465363,0.7236000895500183,-0.9730619192123413,-0.8970786333084106,-0.6123642921447754,-0.021921232342720032,1.0017706155776978,0.02256610244512558,-0.6266136169433594,-1.2440632581710815,-0.9979149699211121,-1.1988608837127686,-0.28992989659309387,-0.2303757220506668,0.1802128553390503,0.7663503289222717,-1.1094486713409424,1.039985179901123,-0.8829042911529541,0.6828474998474121,-0.14366590976715088,1.9354255199432373,0.5699319839477539,-0.21660229563713074,0.8873366117477417,-3.226783883292228E-4,0.989112377166748,-0.37272852659225464,-0.884985625743866,-0.15525661408901215,0.12301242351531982,-0.12686695158481598,-0.18429650366306305,-0.48977941274642944,-0.8759090304374695,-0.2770918905735016,-1.216002106666565,1.1197243928909302,-0.9860119223594666,-0.3192862272262573,-0.11786947399377823,-0.1523355394601822,-0.5691884756088257,-1.5460436344146729,6.945855566300452E-4,1.6761456727981567,-0.535953164100647,0.035867054015398026,-0.9013683795928955,0.262317419052124,-0.45205509662628174,2.0638999938964844,0.21033073961734772,0.18112297356128693,-0.48038506507873535,0.17226223647594452,-0.05365189537405968,0.23836350440979004,-0.25947102904319763,-0.7962462306022644,0.07494057714939117,0.07920397073030472,1.1551189422607422,-1.4623143672943115,0.1249157264828682,0.34251734614372253,0.6594488024711609,-1.364139199256897,1.3500514030456543,-0.48790183663368225,-0.43436604738235474,-0.0882374495267868,-0.42588600516319275,-0.43460625410079956,-0.7071529030799866,1.0602896213531494,-1.5188097953796387,-1.7128716707229614,0.42928892374038696,0.062423255294561386,-0.429059237241745,-0.02914518490433693,0.6931877136230469,0.0833827406167984,0.03813407942652702,-0.8172987699508667,0.26342537999153137,-0.945139467716217,-0.054840341210365295,0.20915524661540985,0.13252998888492584,-0.30074936151504517,0.42424482107162476,-0.9678274393081665,0.9610393047332764\NYTIMES\Trapped on an Island With Wolves, the Only Way Out for These Caribou Was Up\2018-01-18 04:02:30.0\
1615\Science\People with severe mental disorders endure abuse around the world, caged, warehoused in institutions, and imprisoned. But those living chained to trees or concrete blocks in parts of Africa are among the most trapped, forgotten people on earth. One way to end or reduce the reliance on this custom, some experts have argued, would be to introduce Western psychiatry — providing the shackled with diagnoses and medication. One religious leader in Ghana decided that the idea, despite concerns about the drugs and intimations of cultural imperialism, was worth testing. He ran a retreat, or prayer camp, where scores of people were chained. Now, in the current issue of the The British Journal of Psychiatry, a team of Ghanaian and American researchers report results of an experiment at the camp, the first controlled trial of drug treatment among shackled people with mental problems in West Africa. The findings were mixed: Drug treatment, mostly for psychosis, blunted day-to-day symptoms of hallucinations and delusional thinking. But it did not reduce the length of time people were held in chains at the camp. “We are not going to medicate our way out of these kinds of human rights abuses,” said Dr. Robert Rosenheck, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University Medical School, who designed the trial and was a co-author of the report. Dr. Angela Ofori-Atta, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Ghana School of Medicine and Dentistry, led the study and arranged access to chained participants at the prayer camp. She said that the treatment produced some dramatic individual improvements — one man, shackled for 10 years, became strikingly lucid for the first time in memory — and that more careful, and longer, follow-up likely would have found that chaining was reduced, at least somewhat. Experts acknowledged the multiple cultural hazards involved — including obtaining informed consent, perhaps the slipperiest issue — but were impressed the trial happened at all. “The implications are clear: symptom control through the solitary use of medications is not a means to reduce chaining,” wrote Dr. Vikram Patel and Dr. Kamaldeep Bhui, professors of global health at Harvard, in an editorial accompanying the study. “This study reaffirms the need for a comprehensive and humane approach for the management of psychosis.” People are chained at prayer camps throughout West Africa that are mostlyy Christian retreats. Some are tiny and hidden, while others are sprawling places, with open-air churches and cafeterias that teem with people on holy days. The pastors who run the camps and their followers believe that prayer and fasting are the best treatment for mental problems. Camp staffers remove the chains when they decide a person is no longer mentally troubled but consistently lucid, calm, reasonable. That can take days, months or even years, depending on the person and the camp. The leader of the Mt. Horeb camp, about an hour’s drive from Accra, the country’s capital, allowed Dr. Ofori-Atta and a team of psychiatric residents to recruit chained attendees for the study. The team obtained consent in the usual way, explaining the trial and its risks to the people and their families in the Twi language native to the region. Obtaining informed consent is an imperfect process even when engaging patients in the United States who live independently, let alone chained, impoverished West Africans, said Dr. Rosenheck. People held in chains are deeply vulnerable, often poor and uninformed about Western medicine; many are apt to agree to almost anything if the staff and religiousleader approve. “You explain everything in detail, and you ask people. Still, it is as ambiguous a process there as it is here,” Dr. Rosenheck said. Yale’s Global Health Leadership Initiative worked with Dr. Ofori-Atta to develop the study. Funding came from the University of Ghana and Ghana’s health ministry. In the study, the researchers monitored the mental well-being of 110 chained people. The vast majority had a psychotic disorder, like schizophrenia. Half got a diagnosis, using Western labels like schizophrenia and depression, and predominantly drug treatment. The other half continued as before, with no changes to treatment. After six weeks, those on drugs showed clear improvements on a standard rating scale that tracks feelings of hostility, emotional withdrawal and hallucinations. The camp residents doing the ratings did not know which people were on medication and which were not. “The improvements were about the same as we see in trials done in Western countries,” Dr. Rosenheck said. Yet the number of days each person spent in chains was identical in both groups: about 12 days on average, after the initial phase of the trial. The reasons that treatment didn’t reduce chaining are not obvious, said Dr. Ofori-Atta, but may include the length of the trial itself. The decision to remove chains was the camp’s to make, and typically staff want to see steady improvement over time. Dr. Ofori-Atta said that another factor was the abuse of recreational drugs. Some people in chains were addicts likely to return to using drugs if freed, so staffers were slow to turn them loose. In that sense, the study is yet another demonstration that people have little chance of becoming fully well until they are reintegrated into a community with the supports they need, regardless of diagnosis or treatments.\1.0918099880218506,-0.5245218873023987,-0.05733205005526543,0.44019758701324463,-0.3277304172515869,0.23854751884937286,1.363209843635559,-1.4154056310653687,-0.7589886784553528,-0.07779847830533981,-0.09101882576942444,1.9774799346923828,-0.9232889413833618,0.5152492523193359,0.22995680570602417,-0.47204306721687317,-0.7917732000350952,0.6254528760910034,0.2972065806388855,0.6424778699874878,-0.0045520891435444355,-1.1660170555114746,0.08235351741313934,-0.8912395238876343,-0.8588998913764954,-0.3293857276439667,0.4002723693847656,0.6022940874099731,1.137018084526062,-0.31577008962631226,-0.8046358227729797,0.7560177445411682,-0.2666480243206024,-1.3781695365905762,0.2579478919506073,-0.7984955310821533,-0.20818835496902466,0.1376701444387436,-0.09329420328140259,-0.052956439554691315,-0.4309128522872925,-1.1853233575820923,0.47851625084877014,0.10268991440534592,-0.026132497936487198,0.3655800223350525,0.788971483707428,0.4468822181224823,-0.9765443205833435,-0.3149934709072113,1.3226492404937744,0.5912597179412842,0.38805291056632996,-0.6423813700675964,1.4098562002182007,-1.626901388168335,1.6271394491195679,-1.1414355039596558,-0.6472839713096619,0.45310479402542114,-0.9172453284263611,-0.5513607859611511,-0.00645073177292943,0.5885199308395386,-0.7557932734489441,-0.26663461327552795,1.3981720209121704,1.4512064456939697,-0.477132111787796,1.5786093473434448,-0.07644575834274292,-0.780408501625061,-0.8081002831459045,-0.006713567767292261,0.29571616649627686,-0.3367829918861389,-0.03160452842712402,0.6718226671218872,-0.8857413530349731,-0.9680665731430054,0.41747134923934937,-0.9926976561546326,-2.356855630874634,-0.15170516073703766,0.5824699401855469,0.4349888563156128,0.8023834824562073,0.4039236009120941,0.5187507271766663,-0.24495992064476013,-1.7484633922576904,0.12620247900485992,-1.3124291896820068,1.1067577600479126,0.14881017804145813,0.17607679963111877,-0.2467944473028183,-1.3954501152038574,-1.3083322048187256,0.13301458954811096\NYTIMES\Mind: Given Medicine, the Patients Got Better.

1616\Science\The California case in which 13 siblings were found imprisoned at home earlier this week is shocking, but not without precedent. Lurid cases have come to light over the years of children locked in closets and basements, held captive by parents who have crumbled under the weight of drugs, extreme religious conviction, personality disorders or their own abusive backgrounds. The good news, trauma experts say, is that recovery is indeed possible. Victims can reclaim their lives. “The clinical data is encouraging,” said John A. Fairbank, co-director of the National Center for Child Traumatic Stress. “There are good treatments available for children seriously abused and traumatized.” In particular, said Dr. Fairbank, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke, good results have been shown with a relatively short-term cognitive behavioral therapy tailored for trauma patients, an approach developed in the early 1990s but widely disseminated in the last 15 years. A significant hurdle to recovery for the California siblings and children in analogous situations, said psychologists, is that their captors were not stranger-kidnappers but their parents. “In doing the healing work, you look at what the patient’s support systems are, “ said Priscilla Dass-Brailsford, a trauma psychologist and an adjunct professor in the department of psychiatry at Georgetown University. “The biggest supports are parents and family. These kids don’t have that. The parents were the aggressors.” Experts interviewed for this article, who underscored that they had no direct knowledge of the California case, said that because the siblings’ primal assurance of unconditional love and safety had been ripped away, they would almost certainly struggle to trust and attach to future supportive figures. “The notion that this was done by parents increases a child’s helplessness and hopelessness,” said Nora J. Baladerian, a Los Angeles psychologist who often treats traumatized individuals. Dr. Dass-Brailsford compared the 13 siblings’ situation to that of prisoners of war, who have been deprived of food, freedom and sufficient nurturing. “One glimmer of hope is that they did not go through this alone,” she said. “Prisoners of war are isolated as part of their torture. These children at least had each other.” Before formal therapy can begin, the siblings must be placed in a safe, nurturing environment where kind treatment will be a positive constant they can rely upon, experts said. They added that keeping as many siblings together as possible would be important, to sustain their bonds. Daniel L. Davis, a forensic psychologist in Columbus, Ohio who has treated victims and perpetrators and evaluates children for juvenile court, said that there is not one behavioral model that adequately describes a typical parent perpetrator. “There are risk factors, certainly,” he said. A list might include a prior history of abuse, domestic violence, and a cluster of personality disorders such as antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. Such people, he said, might be overly emotional, unpredictable, manipulative and exploitative. But like other trauma experts, Dr. Davis emphasized that children can be remarkably resilient. He treated an elementary school-age boy whose parents had kept him locked away for such a long period that the child showed significant developmental delays. “But with intensive treatment and real effort by a support team, his growth was impressive,” said Dr. Davis. “His parents were sent to prison.” Other examples of children locked away from society by parents do occasionally emerge. A documentary “The Wolfpack” tells the story of seven siblings isolated in a Lower East Side apartment by their father. In 2015, three siblings were found locked by their parents in a urine-and-feces infested room in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. That same year, a teenage girl in Murfreesboro, Tenn., was also discovered having been locked in her bedroom for months by her parents, who had allowed her three siblings to travel at will. Dr. Davis said that while poverty is an element in many cases, it is certainly not a signature characteristic; indeed in the California case, the family lived in a middle-class neighborhood and the father, David Allen Turpin, had reportedly once been employed as an engineer. But poverty-afflicted situations may come to light more often, Dr. Davis noted, “because the perpetrators don’t have the resources to keep shielding from public scrutiny.” Formal treatment begins after children are placed in a secure home and assessed for trauma-related symptoms, including post-traumatic stress disorder. They may be unwilling or unable to describe their experience. Nightmares may roil them. The slightest trigger — the rattle of keys, for example — might send them into a hysterical tantrum. They may seem hyper-aroused or vigilant, ever alert and cringing, braced to flee or fight. Younger children may act out the trauma as they play; for others, the emotional pain may be so overwhelming that they seem numb. “But the majority of these children can bounce back, “ said Anthony P. Mannarino, director of the Center for Traumatic Stress in Children and Adolescents at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. “I’m not saying they’ll forget it but they can find a way to go forward.” Dr. Mannarino is a co-developer of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). The typical treatment, he said, is 12 to 16 sessions. First, a therapist works with a child to manage terrifying thoughts and feelings about the experience. Next a therapist helps the child gradually discuss the trauma. “Those memories are really scary,” Dr. Mannarino said. ”Maybe the parents said, ‘You deserve what you’re getting, it’s your fault,’ and the child may have internalized shame. Helping them talk and processing that distortion gives them a chance to understand that they are not to blame.” Finally, TF-CBT involves the child’s new caregivers. “We work with them to understand that the child’s behavior expresses what happened to the child, as opposed to who they really are,” said Dr. Mannarino. Of numerous therapies developed to address traumatized patients, TF-CBT is one of the most studied. In a 2004 randomized, multisite study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 203 children between eight and 14 who had symptoms of PTSD related to sex abuse, and their caretakers, were randomly assigned to TF-CBT or “child-centered” therapy — a talk therapy model often use in rape-crisis or sex-abuse treatment centers. TF-CBT patients showed significantly more improvement in markers such as PTSD, depression and behavior. Dr. Baladerian hoped that not only would the California family receive sufficient services, but that “the attention will also help other victims whose cases might not have been attended to with such alacrity.”\1.8282526731491089,1.339599609375,-0.9819518327713013,-0.04951275885105133,-0.6378924250602722,0.870267391204834,2.132544994354248,0.4849889874458313,-0.9675585031509399,0.18756967782974243,-0.9809309840202332,0.779248833656311,-1.6616533994674683,-1.1065764427185059,0.16274991631507874,0.6746742725372314,-0.6229191422462463,0.8406168222427368,-0.8968378901481628,0.9625181555747986,0.9652005434036255,-0.9359225630760193,0.6414525508880615,-1.0408185720443726,-0.3151845335960388,0.8008103370666504,-0.04653036221861839,-0.4781301021575928,-0.3554457724094391,-0.8156159520149231,1.2394726276397705,0.5212516188621521,-0.4585261940956116,-0.030623730272054672,0.7172828316688538,-0.7814204096794128,-0.10075881332159042,0.08907602727413177,0.6038362979888916,-0.0014222466852515936,0.47770583629608154,-1.4370975494384766,0.20877321064472198,-1.2722952365875244,-0.9282425045967102,-0.3139774203300476,0.3038666844367981,0.4190613031387329,-2.415052890777588,-0.3299538195133209,1.045400619506836,-0.4889037013053894,-0.4270978569984436,0.6693792343139648,0.43052148818969727,0.2870660126209259,1.0386223793029785,0.509979248046875,-0.3494182527065277,0.7905328869819641,-1.3888927698135376,-0.050599053502082825,0.14345526695251465,-0.6676971912384033,-0.7782973051071167,0.3313206732273102,1.6241306066513062,1.5270618200302124,-1.3685153722763062,1.551474928855896,1.5685673952102661,-0.14756593108177185,-0.6760852336883545,0.2581430971622467,-0.1060151606798172,0.5455806255340576,-0.20010846853256226,0.841944694519043,-0.26076018810272217,-1.1008145809173584,0.7161803245544434,0.8693046569824219,-0.9151107668876648,0.1590958684682846,-0.45213988423347473,-1.5782146453857422,0.7546876072883606,0.7626826167106628,0.28482502698898315,-0.7146713733673096,-0.8878700733184814,0.807278573513031,-1.6474013328552246,0.17435890436172485,-0.12542851269245148,1.1996033191680908,0.4785629212856293,-0.5362858772277832,-2.08467960357666,-0.3779938519001007\NYTIMES\Treatment Offers Hope for Imprisoned California Siblings\2018-01-17 20:38:16.0\
1617\Science\LONDON — Since Britain voted to leave the European Union more than a year ago, Europeans have mockingly said that the decision will result in an isolated, lonely island nation. But Britain, in fact, already has a serious problem with loneliness, research has found. More than nine million people in the country often or always feel lonely, according to a 2017 report published by the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness. The issue prompted Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday to appoint a minister for loneliness. “For far too many people, loneliness is the sad reality of modern life,” Mrs. May said in a statement. “I want to confront this challenge for our society and for all of us to take action to address the loneliness endured by the elderly, by carers, by those who have lost loved ones — people who have no one to talk to or share their thoughts and experiences with.” Mark Robinson, the chief officer of Age UK, Britain’s largest charity working with older people, warned that the problem could kill. “It’s proven to be worse for health than smoking 15 cigarettes a day, but it can be overcome and needn’t be a factor in older people’s lives,” he said. A former United States surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, wrote an article for the Harvard Business Review last year arguing that loneliness needed addressing in the workplace. It can be associated, he wrote, “with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, depression and anxiety.” The British report was commissioned by the Red Cross in partnership with the Co-op, a cooperative supermarket chain, and published by the Cox commission in December. The group operates in memory of Ms. Cox, 41, a Labour Party lawmaker who was shot dead by a right-wing extremist in 2016, and who had been a prominent voice in Parliament on the issue, setting up a cross-party commission that aimed to start a national conversation and establish the scale and impact of loneliness in Britain. The prime minister announced on Wednesday that Tracey Crouch, who is the under secretary for sport and civil society in the culture ministry, would lead a governmentwide group to build on Ms. Cox’s legacy and establish policies on the issue. In parallel, the Office for National Statistics would help to establish a method of measuring loneliness, and a fund would be set up to help the government and charities to develop a wider strategy to identify opportunities to tackle the problem. The Cox commission, led by the lawmakers Rachel Reeves and Seema Kennedy, said it welcomed the government’s “prompt response” to its report. Quoting Ms. Cox, the lawmakers said in a joint statement, “Young or old, loneliness doesn’t discriminate.” “Throughout 2017 we have heard from new parents, children, disabled people, carers, refugees and older people about their experience of loneliness,” they added. Government research has found that about 200,000 older people in Britain had not had a conversation with a friend or relative in more than a month. Carol Jenkins, 64, a retired nurse from Berkshire, in southwest England, said she started to feel lonely when her son moved abroad and she downsized to a smaller house in a different county. “It was a financial decision to move, and I didn’t really have it in me to start making new friends,” Ms. Jenkins recalled on Wednesday in a phone interview. “Months would go by without seeing my friends or family, and I felt really depressed and alone.” Ms. Jenkins has since joined a Facebook group for Britons affected by loneliness, which, she says, has helped her to get out of the house more. “It’s not so much about meeting people on the internet and making new friends, but it’s more of a motivational support network that gives you direction on how to cope and fix the problem,” she said, adding that she was surprised by how many young people had joined the group. “There are so many university students who just lock themselves in their rooms for days because they feel rejected or that they don’t fit in,” Ms. Jenkins said. “It’s only a matter of time before loneliness turns into depression. And that’s where it gets dangerous.”\0.6962094306945801,0.25781741738319397,0.3981727361679077,-0.3297981023788452,1.046990990638733,0.9835270643234253,1.4861606359481812,-0.935908317565918,-0.8833895325660706,0.051566947251558304,0.43853914737701416,1.0068104267120361,-0.7918903827667236,1.1882305145263672,-0.9522866606712341,-0.34215229749679565,0.3374332785606384,-1.2869375944137573,0.06428444385528564,0.140396386384964,-0.9245007038116455,-0.558425784111023,-0.2910706698894501,-0.24069416522979736,-0.17119818925857544,0.6929172873497009,1.055397629737854,-0.41566377878189087,0.37003326416015625,-0.5833263397216797,-0.3355879485607147,0.7407819032669067,0.7307579517364502,-0.4232545793056488,-0.30103498697280884,0.20151785016059875,0.08927805721759796,-0.07051584869623184,-0.4340621531009674,-0.2752276659011841,-0.9576903581619263,-0.27029144763946533,1.2834419012069702,-0.07304739952087402,-0.5820242166519165,-0.10859192907810211,1.1318333148956299,0.47240325808525085,-1.034100890159607,0.7003051042556763,0.4805375933647156,-0.4952012896537781,-0.11538004875183105,-0.010732094757258892,1.8839951753616333,-0.11792099475860596,1.6200295686721802,-0.6564486026763916,-0.8555854558944702,-0.023186733946204185,-0.20160892605781555,-0.6535265445709229,0.19038769602775574,0.3013755679130554,-0.6201493740081787,0.6719189882278442,0.9162557125091553,0.9873369932174683,-0.568814218044281,0.7443432807922363,1.0178394317626953,1.0438402891159058,-0.7154549956321716,0.2211320996284485,-0.4107273519039154,-0.9046069383621216,-0.4109017848968506,0.43825724720954895,-1.3968905210494995,-0.3411097824573517,0.4943779706954956,-0.23084335029125214,-1.9865034818649292,1.150719404220581,0.40495121479034424,-0.2004123330116272,0.1963515281677246,0.5783063173294067,0.22212515771389008,-1.0138728618621826,0.18472856283187866,0.1713443547487259,-1.4836195707321167,0.5373597145080566,0.7995731234550476,-0.16858306527137756,-0.2089463323354721,-1.080580711364746,-1.276262879371643,0.8934968113899231\NYTIMES\U.K. Appoints a Minister for Loneliness\2018-01-18 08:44:57.0\

WASHINGTON — The majority of members of the National Parks System Advisory Board, which advises the federal government on management of the country’s national parks, have jointly resigned to protest Trump administration policies that the board members say have ignored science, squelched efforts to address climate change and undermined environmental protections. The advisory board was established in 1935 to advise the secretary of the interior, who oversees management of the country’s national parks and monuments. Since taking office last year, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has come under criticism from environmental advocates for promoting President Trump’s agenda of opening up the nation’s public lands and waters to fossil-fuel exploration, and for reducing the protection of public monuments. This month Mr. Zinke announced a plan to open up the majority of the nation’s coastlines to offshore drilling. And in December, the administration reduced the size of two national monuments in Utah, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, by some two million acres, the largest rollback of federal land protection in the nation’s history. “From all of the events of this past year I have a profound concern that the mission of stewardship, protection, and advancement of our National Parks has been set aside,” wrote Tony Knowles, the head of the advisory board, in a resignation letter dated Monday that was co-signed by eight other members of the 12-member panel. The Washington Post first reported the letter. “We resigned because we were deeply disappointed with the department and we were concerned,” Mr. Knowles said in an interview. Mr. Zinke, he said, “appears to have no interest in continuing the agenda of science, the effect of climate change, pursuing the protection of the ecosystem.” Mr. Knowles said that Mr. Zinke has refused to meet with his board during his tenure. Phil Francis, chairman of the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, an advocacy group of current and former national park employees, said Tuesday evening, “This discourteous and disrespectful treatment of the Board is inexcusable and, unfortunately, consistent with a decidedly anti-park pattern demonstrated by Secretary Zinke’s department.” An Interior Department spokeswoman did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Mr. Zinke has sought to portray himself as a champion of national parks and has compared himself to Theodore Roosevelt, the founder of the national parks system. The resignations come amid growing concern by scientists that their voices are being suppressed by the Trump administration. Last May, the Environmental Protection Agency dismissed several members of its Board of Scientific Counselors in a move that Trump administration officials said was designed to give greater voice to industry interests in the agency.\0.07737515866756439,-0.10695680975914001,-0.0778227373957634,0.8230925798416138,0.3504480719566345,-0.629159688949585,1.4994945526123047,0.8620117902755737,-1.8384662866592407,-0.6419013738632202,0.28070926666259766,0.1097404807806015,0.13370493054389954,0.534744143486023,-1.1626343727111816,-0.6513201594352722,0.3589774966239929,-0.12516991794109344,-0.2860201895236969,-0.9431700110435486,0.4291279911994934,-0.44284629821777344,-0.16531091928482056,0.008467483334243298,-0.5374062657356262,-0.37240076065063477,0.30236491560935974,-0.7589632868766785,-0.5792137980461121,0.1821405589580536,0.5441096425056458,0.2810019850730896,-0.6277115941047668,-0.2807314693927765,0.4240497946739197,0.03871298208832741,-0.4004288911819458,-0.21582534909248352,0.5044124722480774,-1.2702511548995972,-0.5371232628822327,0.17397835850715637,-0.020530402660369873,-0.8740084171295166,-0.0940786823630333,0.12976408004760742,-0.16188080608844757,0.0790756419301033,-0.1450437754392624,-0.40767043828964233,-0.7979881167411804,-0.8283440470695496,0.2242240309715271,-0.048667702823877335,0.1409287005662918,-0.7003031373023987,0.7113826274871826,0.36725038290023804,-0.9024343490600586,0.5326431393623352,-0.5190340280532837,0.4423421621322632,-0.09158244729042053,-0.06403131783008575,-0.7125699520111084,0.488852858543396,0.810774028301239,-0.284906804561615,0.13107137382030487,0.08305821567773819,0.7498854994773865,0.14357136189937592,0.14803409576416016,-0.11924842745065689,0.17423740029335022,0.0040388586930930614,0.2732384204864502,0.933422327041626,-1.0317484140396118,-0.5208867192268372,1.2428854703903198,0.6328583359718323,-0.3918939232826233,0.7281829118728638,0.0986698642373085,1.8179991245269775,-0.6148183941841125,0.8838274478912354,-0.5762783288955688,-0.05655331909656525,-0.8107928037643433,1.2072045803070068,-1.1072090864181519,-0.6375434398651123,-0.09976119548082352,0.6520541310310364,0.051752228289842606,-0.32771626114845276,-1.041758418083191,-0.1856178194284439\NYTIMES\Citing ‘Inexcusable’ Treatment, Advisers Quit National Parks Panel\2018-01-17 05:12:11.0\
1619\Science\Mathilde Krim, who crusaded against the scourge of AIDS with appeals to conscience that raised funds and international awareness of a disease that has killed more than 39 million people worldwide, died on Monday at her home in Kings Point, N.Y. She was 91. Her death was confirmed by Bennah Serfaty, a spokeswoman for amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, of which Dr. Krim was the founding chairwoman. When the nation learned in the early 1980s that the virus that causes AIDS had begun its terrifying attack upon the human immune system, Dr. Krim, a geneticist and virologist with wide experience in cancer research and a passion for causes, plunged into a fight not only against the virus but also for the civil rights of people who had it. Over the next several decades, she became America’s foremost warrior in the battle against superstitions, fears and prejudices that have stigmatized many people with AIDS, subjecting them to rejection and discrimination. There is still no cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which has become pandemic, although antiretroviral medication can slow the disease and may lead to near-normal life expectancy with prompt diagnosis and treatment. In 2016, there were more than 36.7 million people, worldwide, infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or H.I.V., which causes AIDS. That was 300,000 fewer than in 2015, but the cases nevertheless resulted in one million deaths, down from a peak of 1.9 million in 2005. The virus that causes AIDS is spread by many vectors: through sex, needle-sharing among drug users and accidental needle sticks among medical personnel, as well as through blood transfusions and from mother to infant during pregnancy or breast feeding. In Africa, where the disease originated and where it is most widespread, most transmission is through heterosexual sex. In the early days of the American epidemic, AIDS killed large numbers of hemophiliacs, infected by tainted blood-clotting factors, and Haitians, because the virus had apparently reached the Americas there first. But the American public focused on two other high-risk groups, gay men and drug addicts, people long shunned by family-oriented Americans and the mostly heterosexual establishment. “They felt that this was a disease that resulted from a sleazy lifestyle, drugs or kinky sex — that certain people had learned their lesson and it served them right,” Dr. Krim told The New York Times Magazine in 1988. “That was the attitude, even on the part of respectable foundations that are supposed to be concerned about human welfare.” In his book “The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America” (1997), Charles Kaiser wrote: “One scientist outside the government was more important than any other heterosexual in New York City in sounding the alarm about the growing crisis. Her name was Mathilde Krim.” Money for research and literature to educate the public were needed, and Dr. Krim had access to both. Her husband was the entertainment lawyer Arthur B. Krim, a former chairman of United Artists and Orion Pictures and of the Democratic National Finance Committee. He was a confidant of many national leaders, including Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter. Dr. Krim mobilized a galaxy of friends from the worlds of politics, the arts, entertainment, society and Wall Street. She organized art sales, auctions, fashion shows and other fund-raisers, held benefit parties at her Manhattan townhouse, gave television interviews, lobbied government officials and testified before Congress. And she dazzled them with her scientific knowledge, grounded in her doctoral studies at the University of Geneva, and her dignified appeals to conscience, in many languages. The daughter of parents of Swiss, Italian and Austrian heritage and a convert to Judaism who had joined the Zionist underground, Dr. Krim spoke Italian, German, French and Hebrew as well as English. In 1983, she and others created the AIDS Medical Foundation to raise money and support AIDS research. It often acted faster than federal agencies, which could take a year to process grants. In 1985, her group and another in Los Angeles merged to form the American Foundation for AIDS Research, or amfAR. Elizabeth Taylor was its founding international chairwoman, and Barbra Streisand, Woody Allen and Warren Beatty lent their names. The foundation became the nation’s pre-eminent private supporter of AIDS research, prevention, treatment and advocacy. In 2005, when Dr. Krim stepped down as founding chairwoman, it was renamed the Foundation for AIDS Research, or amfAR, reflecting its international scope. The foundation has raised and invested an estimated $517 million for thousands of programs. Using the foundation as her platform, Dr. Krim promoted needle-exchange programs and the use of condoms and other safe-sex practices; castigated religious leaders who denounced homosexuality as immoral; fought mandatory AIDS testing that might be used to persecute gay people; opposed the use of placebos in experimental drug trials, saying patients might be dead before outcomes were proved; and campaigned for laws to bar discrimination against gay people in housing and employment. Her effectiveness derived partly from her credentials. Besides earning her doctorate in biology, she had served on White House commissions and conducted research at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and at the Cornell Medical College and Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. But it also arose from a moral perspective that could supersede science. She argued, for example, that heterosexuals and homosexuals were all one big risk group. American epidemiologists did not concur at the time, because so many victims were gay, but she was partly right: Although gay sex now accounts for most transmission in the United States, about 24 percent is through heterosexual sex, and women bear the brunt of that, often through sex with partners who conceal the fact that they are bisexual or injecting drugs. Dr. Krim sometimes waded into deep political waters. In 1990, Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York asked her advice on naming a city health commissioner. She recommended Indiana’s commissioner, Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr. But gay groups objected when they learned that Indiana, by law, recorded the names of people with AIDS and could even quarantine those who knowingly had unprotected sex. Although recording the names of carriers and tracing their contacts is standard practice in fighting venereal diseases, and though quarantine has been used to control outbreaks of, for example, drug-resistant tuberculosis, the advocates felt such measures would be stigmatizing. Dr. Krim and others on a search committee first stepped back for a reassessment, then re-endorsed Dr. Myers, then withdrew the endorsement. Dr. Myers was appointed anyway, and Dr. Krim found herself at odds with longtime allies. But her admirers tempered their ire with respect. “I think she’s exceptionally naïve politically,” said the playwright Larry Kramer, a prominent advocate for people with AIDS. “We are all very angry with her, so far as one can ever get angry with Mathilde, because we love her so.” She was born Mathilde Galland in Como, Italy, on July 9, 1926, to Eugene Galland, a Swiss-Italian, and the former Elizabeth Krause, an Austrian. Her father was an agronomist. The family moved to Geneva when Mathilde was 6. At the University of Geneva, Mathilde was a brilliant student of biology and genetics. Appalled by newsreels of Nazi concentration camps in 1945, she sought out Jewish activists, joined the Zionist underground Irgun and spent a summer smuggling guns over the French border for resistance fighters against British rule in Palestine. After earning a bachelor’s degree in 1948, she married an Irgun comrade, David Danon, a Bulgarian medical student, and converted to Judaism. The couple had a daughter, Daphna, in 1951, and in 1953, after Mathilde received her doctorate, they emigrated to Israel, where the marriage ended in divorce. In 1954, she joined the research team of the German-born Israeli molecular biologist Leo Sachs at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. She studied cancer-causing viruses and helped write a dozen papers, including one by Dr. Sachs that laid groundwork for the prenatal diagnostic technique of amniocentesis, detecting gender and possible defects in a fetus. She married Mr. Krim, a Weizmann trustee, in 1958 and moved to New York the next year, exchanging pioneer life in a perpetual war zone for the Upper East Side and an illustrious social milieu. Restless for challenges, Dr. Krim resumed research — at Cornell Medical College from 1959 to 1962 and at Sloan Kettering from 1962 to 1985. She thought she glimpsed a cure for cancer in interferons — proteins released by body cells to fight pathogens — but it was not the cure-all she had envisioned. She was later an adjunct professor at Columbia University. Dr. Krim is survived by her daughter, Daphna Krim; two grandchildren; and a sister, Maria Jonzier. Arthur Krim died in 1994. Dr. Krim’s many awards included the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. Awarded by President Bill Clinton in 2000, it recognized her “extraordinary compassion and commitment.” In his book “The Gay Metropolis,” Mr. Kaiser wrote that Dr. Krim had been disturbed by the initial indifference to the AIDS crisis in the 1980s in part because it carried echoes of her past. “The reaction of many of her heterosexual friends,” he wrote, “reminded her of the stories she had heard about Jews during the war, before she knew any herself, that they were dirty and evil and deserved to die. “Dr. Krim was determined to prevent America from using AIDS to stigmatize homosexuals,” he continued, “and with the help of many of her famous Hollywood friends, she would be magnificently successful.”\1.3272857666015625,1.9879775047302246,-1.1198701858520508,1.540089726448059,-0.5636671185493469,0.22547289729118347,0.8866638541221619,-0.3036181926727295,-2.6045401096343994,-1.1032583713531494,-1.2471332550048828,1.77493155002594,-1.5952006578445435,0.26695337891578674,-0.8692572712898254,-0.8380544781684875,0.24921265244483948,0.15772289037704468,-0.8087202310562134,1.0815081596374512,-0.11406674981117249,-0.2331530898809433,0.30337056517601013,0.64156174659729,-0.998986542224884,-0.13682276010513306,2.5080456733703613,0.7851539850234985,-0.2629448175430298,0.15118086338043213,-0.6742886304855347,1.0560873746871948,-1.2197388410568237,-1.3823076486587524,-0.25801944732666016,1.2879709005355835,-0.7831150889396667,1.5637885332107544,-0.07482937723398209,-1.8781286478042603,-0.46250030398368835,-0.04444313049316406,-0.0424371138215065,-0.3817070424556732,0.6962842345237732,-0.9539276957511902,1.5274114608764648,0.4211006164550781,-1.7509266138076782,0.13151222467422485,0.9086008071899414,-0.3637339770793915,0.08004985004663467,0.9197673201560974,1.125205636024475,-1.1984553337097168,2.682267189025879,0.07292623817920685,-0.207978293299675,1.1085783243179321,-0.7292411923408508,-0.15414316952228546,1.674748182296753,-1.495573878288269,-0.7548485994338989,1.2740005254745483,2.4020488262176514,1.7116479873657227,-1.5620310306549072,0.9646230936050415,0.6981979012489319,-0.45967406034469604,-1.2337218523025513,0.6710585951805115,-0.019991932436823845,-0.053408391773700714,0.07807943224906921,0.2727002799510956,-1.3291808366775513,0.0025927620008587837,1.1613187789916992,0.43711015582084656,-1.957468867301941,1.2361819744110107,0.7389808893203735,-0.3939876854419708,1.8497382402420044,0.9344255328178406,0.8111745119094849,-1.3182145357131958,-1.2910188436508179,2.244335889816284,-2.4945693016052246,0.21611809730529785,0.3858491778373718,0.16643477976322174,-0.3122667074203491,-1.160258173942566,-1.9192508459091187,-0.8538793921470642\NYTIMES\Mathilde Krim, Mobilizing Force in an AIDS Crusade, Dies at 91\2018-01-17 00:12:58.0\
1620\Science\Obesity is linked to prostate cancer, scientists know, but it’s not clear why. On Monday, researchers reported a surprising connection. When prostate cancers lose a particular gene, they become tiny fat factories, a team at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston reported in a paper published in Nature Genetics. Then the cancers spread from the prostate, often with deadly effect. Prostate cancers that have not lost that gene also can spread, or metastasize — in mice, at least — but only if they have a ready source of fat from the diet. That finding suggests that dietary fat can substitute for the loss of the gene, fueling prostate cancer. Moreover, the investigators found, an obesity drug that blocks fat production can make metastatic prostate cancers regress in mice and prevent them from spreading. “What this paper suggests is that fat or high-fat diets promote more aggressive prostate cancer,” said Cory Abate-Shen, interim director of the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University, who was not involved with the research. Now the scientists are planning a clinical trial in men with prostate cancer to see if the obesity drug may be an effective treatment for this cancer. “That’s really important,” Dr. Abate-Shen said. “Aggressive prostate cancer is lethal, and there are no curative drugs right now.” The American Cancer Society estimates that prostate cancer will be diagnosed in about 165,000 American men this year, making it the second most common cancer in American men, behind only skin cancer. The tumors often remain in the prostate and do not kill, but when the cancer spreads, it is lethal. About 29,500 men die of prostate cancer each year. Researchers have been struggling to find new ways to help men with metastatic cancer. Geneticists knew prostate cancers often start when a protective gene, PTEN, shuts down. But the tumors in men that lose only PTEN tend to languish, rarely spreading beyond the prostate and rarely becoming lethal. The cancers change, though, if a second gene, called PML, also shuts down. Suddenly, indolent cells become cancers that spread and kill. But why? In the new study, researchers found that when PML was lost, cancerous cells — in petri dishes and in mice — started churning out fat, which may protect the cells from certain toxic molecules. But the fat also may help the cancers spread, the researchers suggested. PML is also lost in human metastatic prostate cancer, but it has never been clear what the consequences might be. “This is all cool molecular genetics,” said Dr. Pier Paolo Pandolfi, director of the Cancer Center and Cancer Research Institute at Beth Israel Deaconess and lead author of the new study. Dr. Pandolfi has long tried to study prostate cancer spread in mice, but the rodents were not much help. Few genetic manipulations made prostate cancers spread in the animals as they do in humans. Then one day, at a meeting with colleagues, Dr. Pandolfi had an idea: “What are the mice eating?” he asked. It was mouse chow, his co-workers said — a low-fat, vegetarian concoction. “Why don’t we try a simple experiment?” Dr. Pandolfi recalled asking. “Why don’t we put our mice on a high-fat Western diet?” It was the missing link. Mice with prostate cancers that had lost PTEN and that were fed a high-fat diet quickly developed tumors that grew rapidly and spread. It was as though fat in the diet had an effect similar to the loss of PML, the protective gene. Then the group asked a bigger question: Could they could protect mice from metastatic cancer by blocking fat production? That led to the experiment with a new obesity drug, fatostatin. It not only halted the cancer’s spread in the animals, but made it regress. The work leaves plenty of questions for future studies, Dr. Abate-Shen said. High-sugar diets also cause obesity. Are the prostate tumors in men who became fat by eating high-sugar diets equally susceptible to metastasis? If they are, what is the mechanism? And, she and others noted, the studies so far involved human cells in petri dishes and cancers in mice. It remains to be seen if the provocative findings hold for humans. Dr. Pandolfi and his colleagues are planning a clinical trial with fatostatin to treat prostate cancer in humans. They also wonder if low-fat diets might help these patients, and what kinds of dietary fat might fuel prostate cancers. “You cannot just say, ‘Don’t eat fat,’” Dr. Pandolfi said.\0.8749542236328125,0.25983569025993347,-0.8065435290336609,-0.46512535214424133,-0.934421718120575,0.8761656284332275,0.4727250039577484,-0.7180390357971191,-0.8284478187561035,0.30780261754989624,0.4630850553512573,1.9006909132003784,-0.2923521101474762,0.3261104226112366,-0.4409070312976837,-0.375827819108963,0.17698559165000916,0.6843896508216858,0.22538112103939056,0.6372346878051758,0.09896022826433182,-0.5597454309463501,0.10041604936122894,0.3558463454246521,-0.3461502492427826,0.44936132431030273,1.0000572204589844,-1.236860990524292,0.009117207489907742,-0.36767706274986267,0.2589966058731079,1.302837610244751,-0.5141955018043518,0.34220045804977417,-0.6266611218452454,-1.9532815217971802,-0.6787962317466736,-0.35159215331077576,0.2893236577510834,-0.00489603029564023,-0.35124534368515015,-0.6657096147537231,1.2234861850738525,-0.36128783226013184,-0.4770180881023407,1.240991473197937,0.6316239833831787,-1.090515375137329,-1.5335829257965088,0.10265450179576874,1.226840615272522,0.588504433631897,-0.9840870499610901,0.4866348206996918,1.4142460823059082,0.25732892751693726,0.9391272664070129,0.6125351786613464,-0.38794416189193726,0.6062034964561462,-0.8628004193305969,0.11342523247003555,0.30772218108177185,-0.8373669981956482,-0.14349710941314697,-0.09860500693321228,1.6156566143035889,1.1232844591140747,-0.975693941116333,1.1930848360061646,0.7435234189033508,0.44787493348121643,-0.2348320335149765,0.6434363126754761,-0.4245551824569702,0.06341030448675156,0.14178326725959778,0.5312744975090027,-0.8133129477500916,-1.4379626512527466,0.02055809646844864,0.45511308312416077,-1.2117172479629517,0.9879883527755737,0.8166133165359497,-0.4412536919116974,0.023858390748500824,0.14943252503871918,0.32167848944664,-0.1569025218486786,-0.9351858496665955,1.0135498046875,-1.0076326131820679,1.0278249979019165,0.23398171365261078,1.3470649719238281,0.2165597528219223,-0.26551973819732666,-0.7415115237236023,1.432430386543274\NYTIMES\High-Fat Diet May Fuel Spread of Prostate Cancer\2018-01-16 19:04:42.0\
1621\Science\Millions of American children have been exposed to a parasite that could interfere with their breathing, liver function, eyesight and even intelligence. Yet few scientists have studied the infection in the United States, and most doctors are unaware of it. The parasites, roundworms of the genus Toxocara, live in the intestines of cats and dogs, especially strays. Microscopic eggs from Toxocara are shed in the animals’ feces, contaminating yards, playgrounds and sandboxes. These infectious particles cling to the hands of children playing outside. Once swallowed, the eggs soon hatch, releasing larvae that wriggle through the body and, evidence suggests, may even reach the brain, compromising learning and cognition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention periodically tracks positive tests for Toxocara through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The latest report, published in September in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, estimated that about 5 percent of the United States population — or about 16 million people — carry Toxocara antibodies in their blood, a sign they have ingested the eggs. But the risk is not evenly shared: Poor and minority populations are more often exposed. The rate among African Americans was almost 7 percent, according to the C.D.C. Among people living below the poverty line, the infection rate was 10 percent. The odds of a positive test rise with age, but it’s unknown whether this reflects recent infections or simply an accumulation of antibodies from past encounters. Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, calls Toxocara both one of the most common parasites in the country and arguably the most neglected. “We know in some cases it is linked to lower intelligence and epilepsy,” he said. “So if you were to look at disadvantaged kids living in poverty who are also doing lower on tests of school performance, what percentage of that can be attributed to this worm?” While much is still unknown, “there’s enough here to warrant doing a major study on a large number of children.” At the moment, research into Toxocara among Americans is so lacking that the National Institutes of Health funding website lists no grants to study it. Even many of the most basic questions are unanswered, including how often ingested eggs progress to full-blown infection. Among the country’s overlooked parasitic infections, “Toxocara is probably the one that affects the broadest range of people,” said Sue Montgomery, lead of the epidemiology team at the parasitic diseases branch of the C.D.C. “Dogs and cats are everywhere. Many of them may carry the parasites.” Studies indicate that owned pets who receive regular veterinary care rarely carry Toxocara. Poorer neighborhoods bear a disproportionate share of strays. In one survey, 8,700 unowned dogs were said to be roaming parts of Dallas. A survey of New York City playgrounds, presented at a medical conference last year, sampled 21 parks across the city. Toxocara eggs were found in nine parks. Three quarters of samples taken in the Bronx contained eggs in the larval stage, which are more infectious. No parks in Manhattan had eggs with larvae. (The researchers declined to name the parks, saying the data were preliminary.) In some cases, larvae from Toxocara enter the eyes and cause blindness. They can also infect the liver and lungs, leading to a potentially damaging inflammatory reaction. Usually, however, signs of infection are more subtle: a slight fever, fatigue, abdominal pain and cough — symptoms that describe any number of illnesses. Few pediatricians think to test for Toxocara. Untreated, the infection may clear on its own after months or even years, “but we don’t know for sure,” Dr. Hotez said. A C.D.C. survey published in October found that 85 percent of pediatricians admitted to only passing familiarity with the infection, called toxocariasis; given a description of symptoms, slightly less than half of the doctors correctly diagnosed it. When infection is recognized, it can be treated with the anti-parasitic drug albendazole, Dr. Hotez said. “Nobody is dying here,” he said, “but it is potentially causing developmental delays that are affecting quality of life, and the economic impact is far greater. It could trap children in poverty.” In 2014, he published his only contribution to a mental health journal, in JAMA Psychiatry, arguing that parasitic infections such as toxocariasis “likely account for a substantial yet hidden burden of mental illness in the United States.” To what extent, no one can say. The scientific literature contains only scattered reports of Toxocara worms discovered in the central nervous system. “We know that larvae go to the brain in humans,” said Celia Holland, a parasitology professor at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland. But beyond that fact, she says, “we know very little.” Dr. Holland has conducted experiments finding that mice with Toxocara larvae in the brain showed reduced learning ability and less inclination to explore. The greater the degree of infection, the greater the impairment. In prolonged research on mice with extreme infections, “we had to terminate the experiments for ethical reasons because their locomotion started to be affected,” she said. One of the few studies to examine whether cognitive achievement correlated with Toxocara infection in people was published in the International Journal for Parasitology by two researchers at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. Using a cross-section of national data, they found that the mean test scores were lower among children who tested positive for exposure to Toxocara, even after accounting for other known influences such as household income and lead levels in blood. Another study by researchers at Brigham Young University, published in 2015, found a similar association in adults. “In an economy where expertise and performance is increasingly valued, increasingly measured and increasingly plays a role in the work force, this could have broad implications,” said Lance Erickson, a sociology professor at Brigham Young University and one of the report’s authors. Nonetheless, the impairment does not appear to be severe, which is likely why Toxocara receives little notice. “What we don’t see is easy to ignore,” Dr. Erickson said. “There isn’t a story to wrap around it to make it emotionally salient for people. That’s what tends to get political attention and financial attention.” Dr. Hotez is more blunt: “If this were a disease of wealthy kids in Brookline, Mass., and Bethesda, Md., and Westchester, N.Y., we’d be all over it.” After unsuccessful attempts to obtain government grants to research Toxocara, Dr. Hotez approached Congress, meeting in December 2016 with Sen. Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey. According to a spokesman, Mr. Booker plans to introduce legislation to further examine the impact of overlooked infections in the United States, Toxocara among them. “It’s hard for people to accept that it could be having the effect that it is,” said Dr. Holland, of Trinity College. “We don’t really know its impact, which is frustrating. These are larvae burrowing through the brain. It’s not something that any mother or father of a child would welcome.”\0.5681635737419128,-0.8268313407897949,-0.730331540107727,1.1692396402359009,-0.976327121257782,0.9779881238937378,0.8469061255455017,-0.525848925113678,-0.9253228306770325,-0.8645947575569153,0.50604647397995,1.1373158693313599,-0.6808062195777893,0.1072770357131958,-1.3713291883468628,1.1600980758666992,-0.14578595757484436,0.9288277626037598,0.22633814811706543,-0.18056665360927582,0.43270108103752136,-0.25663402676582336,0.14820966124534607,-0.22801069915294647,0.010220144875347614,1.5734350681304932,1.068085789680481,-0.01878293603658676,0.709073543548584,-0.12195435911417007,1.1462267637252808,0.21852366626262665,0.48581063747406006,-0.5681055784225464,0.4686625599861145,-0.51706463098526,-0.9714193940162659,-0.20431309938430786,0.8433736562728882,0.14748963713645935,0.06757291406393051,-1.2243839502334595,0.20494811236858368,-0.5671611428260803,0.015298395417630672,0.7143427133560181,1.3113535642623901,-0.24402573704719543,-0.3067375421524048,0.27487877011299133,1.8424077033996582,-0.37701669335365295,-0.3427683115005493,0.969821572303772,0.3818768262863159,-0.04043761268258095,0.44376328587532043,0.1785183697938919,0.3561052680015564,1.4136414527893066,-0.9402061700820923,-0.437380850315094,-0.5313228964805603,-1.0928126573562622,-0.7872522473335266,-0.2144443541765213,0.781341016292572,1.3523743152618408,-0.6725285649299622,1.9004788398742676,0.5698577165603638,0.39187419414520264,-0.3188227117061615,0.8553038835525513,-0.12947013974189758,0.5329650044441223,1.1834903955459595,1.2711857557296753,-1.1607030630111694,-2.542600393295288,-0.1782868355512619,-0.7544142007827759,-1.561598777770996,1.3306827545166016,0.10720565170049667,-0.3465557098388672,1.1818687915802002,0.6631269454956055,0.5307027697563171,-0.7228639125823975,-1.7551428079605103,0.402057021856308,-1.4765379428863525,0.6270308494567871,0.8798593878746033,1.552581548690796,-0.01513346191495657,-1.104034423828125,-0.2616109549999237,-0.35037386417388916\NYTIMES\The Parasite on the Playground\2018-01-17 16:27:53.0\
1622\Science\A company making “smart thermometers” that upload body temperatures to its website claims to be tracking this year’s flu season faster and in greater geographic detail than public health authorities can. This year’s flu season — which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers “moderately severe” — has left Missouri and Iowa the “sickest states in the country,” said Inder Singh, the founder of Kinsahealth.com. California has had its worst outbreak in five years, with nearly 1 percent of the state exhibiting flu symptoms on Jan. 2, he added. By contrast, New York, New England and the Southeast have had relatively mild seasons so far, but cases are rising and should peak in two weeks. Mr. Singh’s data paints a different picture from that of the C.D.C., which held a news conference Friday to announce that flu activity was “widespread” across the continental United States, which is unusual. (Hawaii’s outbreak is smaller, the agency said.) “There’s lots of flu in lots of places,” said Dr. Daniel B. Jernigan, director of the C.D.C.’s flu division. [READ: Questions and Answers About This Year’s Flu Season] Hospitalization and death rates, though climbing, are still lower than was expected, Dr. Jernigan added, even though most of this season’s cases are H3N2, which is typically the most deadly seasonal strain. Although 20 children and teenagers have already died of flu or its consequences, the 2014-2015 season — the one this season most closely resembles — killed 148. (This year’s final death toll will not be known until summer, because the deaths from lingering pneumonia may occur as late as June.) The C.D.C. data comes from hospitals and clinics that report how many cases of “influenza-like illness” they treat. Delays can result if clinic statisticians are busy or if state health departments do not pass on the figures quickly. Kinsa, by contrast, is able almost instantly to spot fever spikes in states — or even in cities and neighborhoods. More than 500,000 households now own its smartphone-connected oral and ear thermometers, Mr. Singh said, and the company gets about 25,000 readings each day. (Of course, the company cannot measure hospitalizations, deaths, or which strains of flu are circulating, or consistently distinguish flu from other febrile illnesses.) Kinsa’s technology was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2014 and gathered data in subsequent flu seasons; the company hopes to soon publish a study by outside experts assessing its accuracy in measuring the seasonal spread. Those experts, Mr. Singh said, found the data to be more accurate than Google’s Flu Trends, which Google shut down three years ago after it missed the peak of the 2013-2014 season. Google tracked internet searches for terms like “flu,” “fever” and so on, but could be misled by, for example, searches triggered by news coverage. Kinsa’s smartphone app uses a bubble game to entice children to take their temperatures. If fever is detected, it asks parents about other symptoms and then offers basic medical advice or urges the user to see a doctor. The makers of cold medications, disinfectants, toothbrushes and even orange juice buy advertising on the app, Mr. Singh said.\1.002784013748169,-0.27806761860847473,0.4996192753314972,-0.8678986430168152,-0.16734743118286133,1.4153398275375366,0.32590267062187195,0.4971648156642914,-0.12847405672073364,-0.1441023051738739,0.13984091579914093,0.33775925636291504,-1.4565149545669556,-0.7130782008171082,-1.1969866752624512,0.1956685483455658,-0.07883410155773163,0.5339927077293396,-0.186834454536438,0.24087655544281006,0.13394446671009064,0.19907577335834503,0.8126509189605713,-0.7037892937660217,-0.30826517939567566,0.7225011587142944,-0.9198318123817444,-0.5719692707061768,-0.05850405618548393,-0.7478755712509155,-0.1525450497865677,0.5045996308326721,0.6198689937591553,-0.2307608723640442,0.07828094810247421,-1.2847846746444702,0.07921159267425537,-0.5932838320732117,-0.8363562822341919,0.5499762892723083,-0.08126512169837952,-0.35047730803489685,1.005641222000122,0.749984622001648,0.7022085189819336,-0.19571582973003387,1.5636000633239746,-0.4885106086730957,-0.2248092144727707,-0.678096354007721,-0.27660930156707764,-0.5362921357154846,0.49285903573036194,-0.1865786910057068,0.28823330998420715,-0.17102274298667908,0.6951031684875488,0.3443620204925537,-1.1799489259719849,0.5148897171020508,1.0949318408966064,0.17488059401512146,0.9404675364494324,0.3689456284046173,-0.07775023579597473,0.35751157999038696,0.4767806828022003,1.6006693840026855,-0.7776693105697632,0.1743502914905548,-0.07335533201694489,0.29797741770744324,-0.7925465106964111,-0.20916451513767242,-0.3868385851383209,-1.0852926969528198,-0.9185997247695923,1.3315068483352661,-0.6543741822242737,-0.16161850094795227,0.06677759438753128,0.6391119360923767,-0.5541158318519592,1.2659871578216553,-0.5379228591918945,0.05827302485704422,0.21845191717147827,-0.25014013051986694,1.1364822387695312,-0.18447904288768768,-0.6820521354675293,-0.10470674932003021,-0.952133059501648,0.7191769480705261,-0.6677918434143066,0.9164249300956726,0.8573616743087769,-1.753624439239502,-0.012276547029614449,0.44039788842201233\NYTIMES\Global Health: ‘Smart Thermometers’ Track Flu Season in Real Time\2018-01-18 16:42:34.0\
1623\Science\HOUSTON — For a small person who had surgery before he was even born, and who’d just spent an hour and a half squeezing through a tight space that clamped down on his head every few minutes, Baby Boy Royer was showing a feisty spirit. He arrived pink and screaming on Friday at 5:35 a.m., two days before his official due date, weighing 8 pounds 8 ounces, and almost 20 inches long. Within moments of his birth at Texas Children’s Hospital, he did what his parents and doctors had eagerly hoped to see: He moved his legs and feet, a sign that the operation may have prevented damage to the spinal nerves needed for walking. Indeed, placed on his belly, he managed to pull a knee underneath himself and push off, as if he intended to crawl away from the nurses who were trying to swaddle him. His parents said they wanted to know him better before choosing his name, though they had narrowed the list to three candidates. On Sept. 27, as a six-month-old fetus, he underwent experimental surgery while still in his mother’s womb to treat a severe form of spina bifida, in which the tissue that should enclose and protect the spinal column does not form properly. The condition leaves the spine open with nerves exposed, and they sustain damage that can leave a child incontinent and unable to walk. The opening leaks spinal fluid, and the base of the brain can sink into the spinal column and be harmed by pressure. Research has shown that for carefully selected fetuses, surgery before birth rather than after gives the child better odds of being able to walk independently and of avoiding the need for an implanted shunt to prevent fluid buildup in the brain. Usually, the prenatal surgery requires cutting open the uterus. But after carefully studying the options and consulting various specialists, Lexi and Joshuwa Royer chose an experimental approach. In that procedure, developed at Texas Children’s Hospital by Dr. Michael Belfort, the obstetrician and gynecologist-in-chief, and Dr. William Whitehead, a pediatric neurosurgeon, doctors make just tiny slits in the uterus to insert a camera and miniature instruments. The camera sends images to a monitor that the surgeons watch so they can see what they are doing. Though more data is needed, the newer approach seems to have two major advantages, which were important to the Royers. It appears less likely to lead to a premature birth, which can cause many complications for the newborn. And it gives the mother a chance to have a vaginal delivery. Women who have the usual fetal surgery have to give birth by cesarean section, which poses risks for subsequent pregnancies. For the Royers, the procedure, described in an Oct. 23 article in The New York Times, lived up to its promises. Mrs. Royer’s pregnancy lasted the full nine months, and she had a happy, uncomplicated vaginal birth with her husband by her side. Dr. Belfort delivered their son. The infant’s back, which previously had the biggest defect the surgeons had ever repaired, now showed barely a hint of it. But incisions on his sides, made during the fetal surgery to loosen enough tissue to cover the hole in his back, had not closed. Those cuts usually heal on their own after birth, but one had a sizable lump of tissue bulging out and needed suturing. Three hours after he was born, Baby Royer was on an operating table with three plastic surgeons stitching up his sides. The job took less than an hour. Dr. Larry Hollier, the surgeon-in-chief and chief of plastic surgery at Texas Children’s Hospital, marveled at how good Baby Royer’s back looked. “I’ve never seen a such a big defect successfully repaired, with the child moving his feet at birth. It’s unbelievable. If this is the cost of getting that closed — just having to do a little skin operation — it’s fantastic.” Later that day, Baby Royer sucked down a bottle of milk and had no trouble latching on to his mother’s breast. A battery of tests lay ahead. Fetal surgery does not cure spina bifida, doctors warn. It only lessens the disability. So, for Baby Royer, time will tell. The Royers, who moved from San Diego to Houston for four months to be treated there, said they had made the right choice, though it had not been an easy decision. “We faced a lot of doom and gloom in San Diego, but we had a lot of hope and optimism,” Mr. Royer said. “We want to get awareness out to other people that there are options. It’s definitely worth doing the research.” “It was so worth it,” Mrs. Royer said, with tears in her eyes. “I’d do it again in a heartbeat. That’s for sure.”\1.8259836435317993,-0.9439250230789185,-1.0364407300949097,0.2827809751033783,-0.004522934556007385,0.6676139235496521,0.42089805006980896,0.9073817729949951,-1.6155954599380493,-1.2780369520187378,0.12119890004396439,1.8445152044296265,0.18960878252983093,0.5756720304489136,0.24142567813396454,0.16435278952121735,-0.3542843461036682,0.12235255539417267,-0.05362560227513313,-0.06593488901853561,0.5618435740470886,-1.0385388135910034,0.5868387222290039,-1.0793571472167969,-0.5102565288543701,0.9620664119720459,1.0121318101882935,0.4767473638057709,-0.1960306614637375,-0.20848339796066284,0.6797459125518799,1.4558759927749634,0.38636884093284607,1.0860817432403564,-1.5905801057815552,0.33990758657455444,-0.4627915620803833,-0.7855156660079956,1.90294349193573,0.09670759737491608,0.254998117685318,-0.020831430330872536,0.8849191069602966,-0.21606598794460297,0.4557400941848755,-0.33975598216056824,0.9693536162376404,-0.581722617149353,-2.447234630584717,-0.7402297854423523,1.9604121446609497,-0.39289551973342896,-2.0273537635803223,0.0562276616692543,0.9679234027862549,-0.5749903917312622,1.3302700519561768,0.4365847110748291,-0.7853267192840576,1.2277195453643799,0.23801733553409576,0.43844377994537354,0.9253914952278137,-0.8218511343002319,-0.061091724783182144,1.0955517292022705,1.6508831977844238,1.9708939790725708,-0.34767305850982666,0.17391352355480194,1.074157476425171,0.5341569185256958,-0.4543454051017761,0.03449573367834091,-1.0617691278457642,0.8838805556297302,-0.5974900722503662,1.3826909065246582,-1.3439550399780273,-1.855163335800171,0.43352216482162476,0.029399001970887184,-0.36762556433677673,0.03631472587585449,1.3243627548217773,0.5625558495521545,0.1840519905090332,0.41162973642349243,0.6405245661735535,0.4515829086303711,0.4008590877056122,0.7392721772193909,-1.887616753578186,0.26385244727134705,-0.09822530299425125,1.2494434118270874,-1.2103335857391357,-0.6492803692817688,-0.9980051517486572,1.9061845541000366\NYTIMES\The Healing Edge: After Surgery in the Womb, a Baby Kicks Up Hope\2018-01-15 18:00:36.0\

MONUMENT VALLEY, Utah — Garry Holiday grew up among the abandoned mines that dot the Navajo Nation’s red landscape, remnants of a time when uranium helped cement America’s status as a nuclear superpower and fueled its nuclear energy program. It left a toxic legacy. All but a few of the 500 abandoned mines still await cleanup. Mining tainted the local groundwater. Mr. Holiday’s father succumbed to respiratory disease after years of hacking the ore from the earth. But now, emboldened by the Trump administration’s embrace of corporate interests, the uranium mining industry is renewing a push into the areas adjacent to Mr. Holiday’s Navajo Nation home: the Grand Canyon watershed to the west, where a new uranium mine is preparing to open, and the Bears Ears National Monument to the north. The Trump administration is set to shrink Bears Ears by 85 percent next month, potentially opening more than a million acres to mining, drilling and other industrial activity. But even as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke declared last month that “there is no mine within Bears Ears,” there were more than 300 uranium mining claims inside the monument, according to data from Utah’s Bureau of Land Management office that was reviewed by The New York Times. The vast majority of those claims fall neatly outside the new boundaries of Bears Ears set by the administration. And an examination of local B.L.M. records, including those not yet entered into the agency’s land and mineral use authorizations database, shows that about a third of the claims are linked to Energy Fuels, a Canadian uranium producer. Energy Fuels also owns the Grand Canyon mine, where groundwater has already flooded the main shaft. Energy Fuels, together with other mining groups, lobbied extensively for a reduction of Bears Ears, preparing maps that marked the areas it wanted removed from the monument and distributing them during a visit to the monument by Mr. Zinke in May. Energy Fuels’ lobbying campaign, elements of which were first reported by The Washington Post, is part of a wider effort by the long-ailing uranium industry to make a comeback. The Uranium Producers of America, an industry group, is pushing the Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw regulations proposed by the Obama administration to strengthen groundwater protections at uranium mines. Mining groups have also waged a six-year legal battle against a moratorium on new uranium mining on more than a million acres of land adjacent to the Grand Canyon. For the Navajo, the drive for new mines is a painful flashback. “Back then, we didn’t know it was dangerous — nobody told us,” Mr. Holiday said, as he pointed to the gashes of discolored rocks that mark where the old uranium mines cut into the region’s mesas. “Now they know. They know.” Supporters of the mining say that a revival of domestic uranium production, which has declined by 90 percent since 1980 amid slumping prices and foreign competition, will make the United States a larger player in the global uranium market. It would expand the country’s energy independence, they say, and give a lift to nuclear power, still a pillar of carbon-free power generation. Canada, Kazakhstan, Australia, Russia and a few other countries now supply most of America’s nuclear fuel. The dwindling domestic market was thrust into the spotlight by the contentious 2010 decision under the Obama administration that allowed Russia’s nuclear agency to buy Uranium One, a company that has amassed production facilities in the United States. The Justice Department is examining allegations that donations to the Clinton Foundation were tied to that decision. “If we consider nuclear a clean energy, if people are serious about that, domestic uranium has to be in the equation,” said Jon J. Indall, a lawyer for Uranium Producers of America. “But the proposed regulations would have had a devastating impact on our industry.” “Countries like Kazakhstan, they’re not under the same environmental standards. We want a level playing field.” The trip was one of the earliest made by Mr. Zinke to the vast lands he oversees as secretary of the interior: a visit to Bears Ears, where he struck a commanding figure, touring the rugged terrain on horseback. A notable presence on Mr. Zinke’s trip was Energy Fuels, the Canadian uranium producer. Company executives openly lobbied for shrinking Bears Ears’ borders, handing out the map that marked the pockets the company wanted removed: areas adjacent to its White Mesa Mill, just to the east of the monument, and its Daneros Mine, which it is developing just to the west. “They wanted to talk to anyone who’d listen,” said Commissioner Phil Lyman of San Juan County, Utah, a Republican who participated in the tour and is sympathetic to Energy Fuels’ position. “They were there representing their business interest.” Mr. Zinke has insisted that mining played no role in the decision to shrink Bears Ears, and a department spokeswoman said he had met with interested parties on all sides. But President Trump has prioritized scrapping environmental regulations to help revitalize domestic energy production. His executive order instructing Mr. Zinke to review Bears Ears said that improper monument designations could “create barriers to achieving energy independence.” In theory, even after President Barack Obama established Bears Ears in 2016, mining companies could have developed any of the claims within it, given proper local approvals. But companies say that expanding the sites, or even building roads to access them, would have required special permits, driving up costs. Energy Fuels said it had sold its Bears Ears claims to a smaller company, Encore Energy, in 2016. But Encore issued shares to Energy Fuels in return, making Energy Fuels Encore’s largest shareholder, with a seat on its board. Curtis Moore, an Energy Fuels spokesman, said the company had played only a small part in the decision to shrink Bears Ears. The company proposed scaling back the monument by just 2.5 percent, he said, and was prepared to support a ban within the rest of the original boundaries. Yet two weeks after Mr. Zinke’s visit, Energy Fuels wrote to the Interior Department arguing there were many other known uranium deposits within Bears Ears “that could provide valuable energy and mineral resources in the future” and urging the department to shrink the monument away from any “existing or future operations.” A bill introduced last month by Representative John Curtis, Republican of Utah, would codify Mr. Trump’s cuts to the monument while banning further drilling or mining within the original boundaries. But environmental groups say the bill has little chance of passing at all, let alone before the monument is scaled back next month. “Come February, anyone can place a mining claim on the land,” said Greg Zimmerman, deputy director at the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group. At the end of a dirt road just six miles from the Grand Canyon’s South Rim, the uranium industry’s renewed ambitions, and challenges, are on display. Three decades after exploratory drilling uncovered uranium deposits, production at Energy Fuels’ Canyon Mine is finally starting up, the wheel above a 1,500-foot shaft slowly turning during a recent visit. The company calls Canyon Mine a “high-grade” project, with the potential to compete with mines overseas. It is already running into trouble. As workers drilled into the formations that make up the region’s distinct rock layers last year, they hit shallow groundwater. The water flooded the mine’s shaft, forcing workers to pump the runoff — by then contaminated with uranium — into open ponds, where they used industrial sprayers to speed evaporation. Those sprayers were present during a recent visit, and water could be seen from outside the compound continuing to pour into a large evaporation pond. Energy Fuels officials said hitting shallow groundwater was to be expected, and rejected concerns that contamination could escape. Still, Fred Tillman, an environmental engineer with the United States Geological Survey, said during a recent visit to the mine that the groundwater flows in the region were too complex to rule out the risk of contamination. “There are these big unknowns about the potential impacts on cultural resources, on biological resources, on water resources,” Dr. Tillman said. Even as troubles persist on the ground, the industry pushback has continued. In court, mining groups led by the National Mining Association have challenged a 20-year moratorium on mining in the Grand Canyon watershed, established in 2012 by the Obama administration. (The Canyon Mine predates the moratorium.) A federal court of appeals upheld the moratorium last month. But the United States Forest Service has recommended rolling back the protections, meaning the Trump administration could soon reverse them on its own. The Arizona Chamber of Commerce, which represents mining interests, also backed an effort to defeat a separate proposal that would have permanently banned mining on 1.7 million acres surrounding the Grand Canyon. An Energy Fuels executive testified in Congress against the ban. And with the help of Republican senators like John Barrasso of Wyoming, the industry has pressed the E.P.A. to withdraw an Obama-era proposal that would strengthen groundwater protections at uranium mines. Senator Barrasso has received more than $350,000 in campaign contributions from mining groups over his career. His office did not respond to requests for comment. The proposal would regulate a mining method called in-situ recovery, which involves injecting a solution into aquifers containing uranium and bringing that solution to the surface for processing — a method criticized by environmentalists as posing wider contamination risks. The rule is unnecessary and will cost jobs, Mr. Indall, the lawyer for Uranium Producers of America, said in a letter to Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator. In July, U.P.A. representatives met with Mr. Pruitt and Energy Secretary Rick Perry to press their case. The E.P.A. said in a statement that it was “reviewing options for next steps.” Last month, Mr. Barrasso again called on the agency to withdraw the rule, calling it “unreasonably burdensome.” The Navajo town of Sanders, Ariz., a dusty outpost with a single stoplight, is a reminder of uranium’s lasting environmental legacy. In Sanders, hundreds of people were exposed to potentially dangerous levels of uranium in their drinking water for years, until testing by a doctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University named Tommy Rock exposed the contamination. “I was shocked,” Mr. Rock said. “I wasn’t expecting that reading at all.” Mr. Rock and other scientists say they suspect a link to the 1979 breach of a wastewater pond at a uranium mill in Church Rock, N.M., now a Superfund site. That accident is considered the single largest release of radioactive material in American history, surpassing the crisis at Three Mile Island. It wasn’t until 2003, however, that testing by state regulators picked up uranium levels in Sanders’s tap water. Still, the community was not told. Erin Jordan, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, said the department had urged the now-defunct local water company for years to address the contamination, but it had been up to that company to notify its customers. Only in 2015, after Mr. Rock raised the alarm, did local regulators issue a public notice. The town’s school district, whose wells were also contaminated with uranium, received little state or federal assistance. It shut off its water fountains and handed out bottled water to its 800 elementary and middle-school students. The schools finally installed filters last May. Parents remain on edge. “I still don’t trust the water,” said Shanon Sangster, who still sends her 10-year-old daughter, Shania, to school with bottled water. “It’s like we are all scarred by it, by the uranium.”\1.293857455253601,0.3997798562049866,-1.949851155281067,0.10059353709220886,0.2622062563896179,-0.18105198442935944,1.1328248977661133,0.03342190757393837,-2.4007785320281982,-1.2094382047653198,-0.7143678665161133,-0.024549618363380432,-0.009596101008355618,0.42639368772506714,-1.8416889905929565,-0.9485419392585754,-0.7218895554542542,0.28419020771980286,0.17354315519332886,-0.35982057452201843,0.2682182192802429,-0.9878473877906799,1.0681110620498657,-1.091064691543579,-0.4184039533138275,0.21599344909191132,2.097553014755249,-1.149364709854126,-2.700850486755371,0.1469079554080963,-1.5480103492736816,2.3378329277038574,-0.6802588105201721,-1.147645115852356,-1.4074163436889648,-1.5474669933319092,-0.45444953441619873,-0.6592759490013123,-0.9394603371620178,-0.8783437013626099,-1.1352348327636719,0.3570912182331085,1.0736585855484009,0.38651469349861145,-1.2542623281478882,1.1409155130386353,0.47582897543907166,0.9756729006767273,-1.177125096321106,-0.36893969774246216,0.6613064408302307,-0.14200976490974426,1.0103389024734497,-1.0770652294158936,0.7792046070098877,-1.1050176620483398,0.8144175410270691,-0.045932576060295105,-0.8498462438583374,0.708959698677063,-1.519752025604248,-0.2576373219490051,-0.3739105463027954,0.4272441565990448,-0.6441855430603027,-1.7120426893234253,0.834703266620636,2.0092275142669678,-0.9018999934196472,1.1975764036178589,0.9373868703842163,0.9411612749099731,-1.1035783290863037,1.2553517818450928,-0.32276666164398193,1.7288413047790527,0.24329987168312073,0.12081728875637054,-0.2681485116481781,0.2615312337875366,1.6215718984603882,-0.5688740015029907,-2.3341751098632812,0.443782240152359,1.531834363937378,-0.41791611909866333,0.4765196442604065,-0.21840089559555054,1.2495691776275635,-0.09284552186727524,-1.8011916875839233,1.927829384803772,0.07268460839986801,-0.2914354205131531,0.33182013034820557,0.18041028082370758,1.1981863975524902,-0.08368033170700073,-1.6885062456130981,-0.5889877676963806\NYTIMES\Uranium Miners Pushed Hard for a Comeback.

1625\Science\The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has decided to postpone its session on nuclear attack preparedness next week. Much attention had been drawn to the timing of the agency’s session, which was publicized just days after President Trump touted the size of his nuclear button compared with North Korea’s. Late Friday afternoon, the C.D.C. announced that it had changed its mind about next Tuesday’s topic, making a last-minute revision to reflect concerns about cases of severe flu. “To date, this influenza season is notable for the sheer volume of flu that most of the United States is seeing at the same time, which can stress health systems,” the agency said. “The vast majority of this activity has been caused by influenza A H3N2, associated with severe illness in young children and people 65 years and older.” Kathy Harben, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the Tuesday session would now address guidance for health professionals on trying to reduce the spread of the flu and to help with shortages of antiviral medicines in some hard-hit areas. [READ: Questions and Answers About This Year’s Flu Season] The C.D.C.’s announcement that it was holding a nuclear preparation workshop drew widespread media coverage and embarrassed the public health agency. It also gave ammunition to administration critics who believe that the president is bringing the country closer to a nuclear Armageddon. The agency did not address whether the publicity influenced its decision to switch topics next week, or whether its decision was discussed with anyone in the Trump administration. “While a nuclear detonation is unlikely,” the C.D.C. wrote on its website, which included a picture of a mushroom cloud, “it would have devastating results and there would be limited time to take critical protection steps. Despite the fear surrounding such an event, planning and preparation can lessen deaths and illness.” The agenda for the disaster session included “Preparing for the Unthinkable,” “Road Map to Radiation Preparedness” and “Using Data and Decision Aids to Drive Response Efforts.” The replacement program, also next Tuesday, features sessions on “Chasing Flu,” “The Problem of H3N2” and “Mitigating Influenza With Vaccines and Antivirals.” The C.D.C. said that the nuclear survival program would be rescheduled.\1.632085919380188,-0.11695753037929535,-0.3340872824192047,-0.3973872661590576,0.6650888919830322,0.2208656370639801,0.6713571548461914,0.6732844114303589,-0.539968729019165,0.1796925812959671,0.19266168773174286,1.1483832597732544,-0.0368693545460701,1.4717243909835815,-0.6512938737869263,0.07501073181629181,-0.42604395747184753,0.393451064825058,-0.340236634016037,0.40945976972579956,-0.5085909962654114,-0.23144832253456116,0.38875842094421387,-0.7574469447135925,-0.3071078062057495,0.5864303112030029,0.15430165827274323,-0.05143497884273529,1.1108965873718262,0.2805549204349518,-0.015966612845659256,0.5457890033721924,-1.0081900358200073,-0.2680438458919525,-0.20311479270458221,-0.18195493519306183,-0.15151824057102203,-0.454143226146698,-0.36370375752449036,-0.42150580883026123,0.39442187547683716,-0.41053783893585205,0.15298369526863098,-0.2514978051185608,0.19753824174404144,0.9984754920005798,0.7853145003318787,0.5736027956008911,-0.683005154132843,0.49285098910331726,0.5400986075401306,0.38166573643684387,0.5970710515975952,1.0376609563827515,0.990278422832489,-0.8127557635307312,0.6415534019470215,-0.7214035987854004,-0.1111069992184639,0.9592077136039734,0.2486390322446823,0.22310996055603027,0.3497892916202545,0.2940932512283325,-0.24827630817890167,0.6189734935760498,0.033924736082553864,1.579053521156311,-0.56996089220047,-0.07322096079587936,-0.0315701924264431,0.6788593530654907,0.24477535486221313,0.3910844326019287,-1.1616073846817017,-0.23598454892635345,-0.1345777064561844,1.0429538488388062,-1.3386555910110474,0.13105487823486328,0.6314986348152161,-0.2954983413219452,-0.49420908093452454,-0.2229500710964203,0.6833072304725647,-0.04008667171001434,0.057375695556402206,0.7574073076248169,0.28856217861175537,-0.5221315026283264,-0.30510973930358887,0.8149961233139038,-0.601948618888855,-0.2617667317390442,-0.5431306958198547,0.060482002794742584,0.08498870581388474,-1.0673004388809204,-0.2472068816423416,0.2892482578754425\NYTIMES\C.D.C.

1626\Science\Dr. Ronald R. Fieve, who was a pioneer in the prescription of lithium to treat mania and other mood disorders — while avowing that some gifted individuals, like Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, might have benefited from being bipolar — died on Jan. 2 at his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 87. The cause was congestive heart failure, his daughter Vanessa Fieve Willett said. Alerted by his adviser, Dr. Lawrence Kolb, to groundbreaking research in Australia, Dr. Fieve (pronounced FEE-vee) began experimenting with lithium to mitigate depression in the 1950s, when he was a resident at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. He and a colleague, Dr. Ralph N. Wharton, went on to identify lithium as the first naturally occurring medication to prevent and control a specific psychiatric disorder and reduce the risk of relapses. In 1966 Dr. Fieve established the first lithium clinic in North America. “During the 1970s, it was apparent that psychiatry was going through a difficult transition and suffering from an identity crisis,” Dr. Fieve wrote in “Bipolar Breakdown” (2009), one of several of his popular books. “While many psychiatrists, psychologists and psychoanalysts held on to Freud’s psychoanalytic explanation of the major mood disorders,” he continued, “there was compelling scientific evidence to the contrary. The medical model, with an emphasis on heredity and brain chemistry, began to replace Freud, and the age of psychopharmacology was born.” In 1970, when he was chief of research in internal medicine at the psychiatric institute and the psychiatric department of what was then called the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center (it is now NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center), Dr. Fieve and several other researchers persuaded the Food and Drug Administration to approve the prescription of lithium salts for acute mania. He cited estimates that as many as one in 15 people experienced a manic episode during their lifetimes, and that bipolar disorder — characterized by swings from elation, hyperactivity and a decreased need for sleep to incapacitating depression — was often misclassified as schizophrenia or other illnesses, or undiagnosed altogether. He cautioned, however, that some highly creative, exuberant and energetic people have derived benefits from the condition because they have what he called “a hypomanic edge.” “I have found that some of the most gifted individuals in our society suffer from this condition — including many outstanding writers, politicians, business executives and scientists — where tremendous amounts of manic energy have enabled them to achieve their heights of success,” Dr. Fieve told a symposium in 1973. But without proper treatment, he said, those individuals afflicted with manic depression “more often than not either go too ‘high’ or suddenly crash into a devastating depression that we only hear about after a successful suicide.” In contrast to antidepressant drugs or electroshock treatments, he said, regular doses of lithium carbonate appeared to stabilize mood swings without cramping creativity, memory or personality. He promoted the use of lithium in the 1970s on radio and television talk shows, where he often appeared with the theatrical and film director Joshua Logan, a former patient. Dr. Fieve’s books included “Moodswing: The Third Revolution in Psychiatry” (1975) and “Prozac: Questions and Answers for Patients, Family and Physicians” (1994). In “Moodswing,” he wrote that the family histories of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Churchill suggested that they may have been manic depressives. Lithium, a powdery chemical element that is extracted from igneous rock and mineral water, is also used in batteries, lubricating grease and rocket fuel. Before it was approved to treat depression, lithium was found in the late 1940s to be potentially unsafe as a salt substitute. But Dr. Fieve pointed out that lithium had been found in natural mineral waters prescribed by Greek and Roman physicians 1,500 years earlier to treat what were then called manic insanity and melancholia. Since then, researchers have found that people with genetic markers for colorblindness and a specific blood type were susceptible to manic depression. Dr. Fieve, who learned decades ago that he had diabetes, told The New York Times in 1975 that “the public should now be educated that depression is a medical illness like many others.” “It’s like diabetes or a thyroid condition,” he added — if you take the prescribed medication, the condition is under control and “you’re not sick anymore.” Ronald Robert Fieve was born on March 5, 1930, in Stevens Point, Wis., about 80 miles west of Green Bay. His parents, Bjarne Ellertson Fieve and the former Evelyn Knudsen, were Scandinavian immigrants. (His father had changed the spelling of his surname from Five because he didn’t want people to pronounce it like the number.) Bjarne Fieve was an engineer, and Ronald studied to become one, too. But he became more interested in medicine when he received his diabetes diagnosis at 19. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin with a bachelor of science degree, he attended Harvard Medical School. He interned in cardiology at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan and was a resident at what is now NewYork-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center and at Columbia University Medical Center, which is affiliated with the New York State Psychiatric Institute, under the aegis of the state Office of Mental Health. In 1963 Dr. Fieve married Katia von Saxe, a novelist who writes under the name Jane Huxley. She and his daughter Vanessa survive him, as do another daughter, Lara Fieve-Portela, and four grandchildren. He had homes in Manhattan and Southampton, N.Y., as well as Palm Beach, Fla. As a clinical psychopharmacologist, Dr. Fieve conducted research and treated private patients in New York. He was a distinguished professor emeritus in psychiatry for NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and founder of the Foundation for Mood Disorders in Manhattan. In 1980, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association, redefined manic-depressive psychosis, in which patients swing alternately between major depression and mania, as bipolar affective disorder, in part as a result of Dr. Fieve’s research. Dr. Fieve, along with Professor Joseph L. Fleiss and Dr. David L. Dunner, was also instrumental in distinguishing a milder version, which the manual classified in 1994 as Bipolar II.\1.2679954767227173,0.8578524589538574,-0.7952041625976562,0.8997477293014526,0.061936333775520325,0.003513777395710349,0.8228640556335449,0.39653363823890686,-2.3893468379974365,-0.9419773817062378,-0.6953976154327393,1.319654107093811,0.05121857300400734,0.7785846590995789,-0.5689785480499268,0.7462582588195801,-0.2972259521484375,-0.15515322983264923,0.7414104342460632,0.11134294420480728,0.15491195023059845,-0.36421042680740356,-0.3476645052433014,0.1670500636100769,-1.3650243282318115,-0.2981856167316437,1.4179502725601196,1.179606318473816,-1.590545415878296,-0.21470272541046143,-0.3654557764530182,0.6202890276908875,-0.5806025266647339,-1.2628445625305176,-0.5017837882041931,-0.49895161390304565,-0.3978838324546814,0.8597588539123535,-0.6492996215820312,-0.355034202337265,0.007460353896021843,0.7212120890617371,1.4418021440505981,0.15742124617099762,0.622791588306427,-1.2826663255691528,0.4777410328388214,0.24971550703048706,-2.9356415271759033,0.5868440866470337,0.9344898462295532,-1.760522484779358,0.3631635904312134,0.7871810793876648,1.9510546922683716,-0.35090842843055725,0.7582737803459167,0.3794856369495392,-0.6632065773010254,1.2160087823867798,-1.9983144998550415,0.2741130292415619,0.6076491475105286,-0.4628893733024597,-0.9892085194587708,-0.06640161573886871,1.5853904485702515,1.2105060815811157,-1.5167419910430908,0.6565978527069092,0.697609007358551,-0.41998377442359924,-1.0597219467163086,0.8847437500953674,0.165525421500206,0.3018600642681122,1.3432731628417969,1.1615300178527832,-0.40571901202201843,-0.8472808599472046,1.188124179840088,0.09998857975006104,-0.6043554544448853,0.4332771599292755,0.3059858977794647,-1.5827702283859253,1.9681891202926636,0.6156454086303711,0.5484012365341187,-0.9942354559898376,-1.1430318355560303,1.0990321636199951,-2.335838794708252,0.2865971028804779,0.460978239774704,0.571567177772522,-0.48252081871032715,-0.9235195517539978,-1.3128985166549683,-0.3335783779621124\NYTIMES\Dr. Ronald Fieve, 87, Dies; Pioneered Lithium to Treat Mood Swings\2018-01-16 18:10:36.0\
1627\Science\WASHINGTON — Kentucky will be the first state to require many of its Medicaid recipients to work or face losing their benefits after the Trump administration approved its plan on Friday. Advocates for the poor threatened lawsuits, while Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, celebrated the approval as “the most transformational entitlement reform that has been seen in a quarter of a century.” The plan calls for most Medicaid recipients who are not disabled and aged 19 to 64 to work at least 20 hours a week, beginning in July. In addition to paid jobs, they could meet the requirement through volunteer work, job training, searching for a job, taking classes or caring for someone elderly or disabled. Pregnant women, full-time students, primary caretakers of dependents and the chronically homeless will be exempt from the work requirement, as will people deemed medically frail. But the Bevin administration still expects about 350,000 people to be subject to the requirement, which will be phased in around the state starting in July. About half of them already meet it, according to the administration. “We are ready to show America how this can and will be done,” Mr. Bevin said at a news conference in Frankfort. “It will soon become the standard and the norm in the United States of America, and America will be better for it.” Roughly 500,000 adults have joined Kentucky’s Medicaid rolls since the state expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act in 2014. Mr. Bevin has consistently attacked the expansion as a waste of money, questioning why “able-bodied” adults should be given free government health care that used to be largely limited to children, the elderly and the disabled. He filed for federal permission to impose work requirements in 2016 — notably, instead of seeking to end the state’s Medicaid expansion altogether. And since then, more than a dozen other states have also sought work requirements or said they plan to. Several sought Medicaid work requirements during the Obama administration but were rebuffed. The approval came just a day after the Trump administration gave states the O.K. to impose work or other “community engagement” requirements as a condition of getting Medicaid. According to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, 60 percent of working-age Medicaid recipients who aren’t disabled already have full- or part-time jobs. Under its plan, Kentucky will also require many adults who aren’t elderly or disabled to pay premiums of $1 to $15 a month, depending on their income. And it will disenroll people from Medicaid for up to six months if they fail to report changes in income or work status. Those who qualified for Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion will also have to “earn” dental and vision benefits, which they have been able to access freely until now, through activities like taking a financial literacy course or getting a GED. The Bevin administration has estimated that the plan will result in 100,000 fewer Medicaid recipients after five years and save $2.4 billion, mostly in federal Medicaid funds. But Mr. Bevin couched the policy change as a moral rather than a fiscal decision, saying he did not care about the savings and saw it as an opportunity for Kentucky’s poor “not to be put into a dead-end entitlement trap but rather to be given a path forward and upward so they can do for themselves.” Advocates for Medicaid beneficiaries said they disagreed with the Trump administration’s assertion, in approving Kentucky’s plan, that work requirements were consistent with the goals of Medicaid because work could improve people’s health. “Considering that it will seriously harm over 100,000 Kentuckians, in violation of numerous provisions of Medicaid law, we are very seriously considering taking legal action — and as we analyze the meager legal rationale in the approval itself, it seems inevitable,” said Leonardo Cuello, director of health policy at the National Health Law Program, an advocacy group for the poor. Emily Beauregard, the executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group, said the state had provided little information about how it would make sure people were complying with work requirements, how exemptions would be determined and other details. “We’re anticipating Kentuckians by and large are going to be extremely confused and worried about what they’re going to face and whether or not they’ll continue to have coverage,” Ms. Beauregard said. “They’ll be looking to advocates and enrollment assisters and their providers for answers, and at this point we don’t have any.” She added, “The idea that we are encouraging work and independence, then taking away the health care that makes people more employable and better able to function — none of this adds up to something that’s going to be good for Kentuckians or our economy.” But Hal Heiner, Kentucky’s Education and Workforce Development secretary, said during Mr. Bevin’s news conference that there was “an abundance of jobs” available to Medicaid recipients, as well as resources to prepare them. “We have the jobs, we have the tuition resources, we have the job coaches in our career centers all across the state,” he said, “and now we’ll be able to connect the dots.” Other state officials said the state was building an IT system to track people’s compliance with the work and premium requirements and participation in activities, like taking the financial literacy course, that would earn them points toward dental and vision care. They did not, however, provide a cost estimate for building and maintaining the administrative infrastructure necessary to monitor compliance with the new requirements. Kentucky’s uninsured population has dropped more than almost any other state’s under the Affordable Care Act, and several studies have found significantly increased access to primary care, preventive screenings and care for chronic conditions there since the Medicaid expansion. But the state’s population remains unhealthy overall, which Mr. Bevin pointed to as proof that the Medicaid expansion was not working. “The idea that we should keep doing what we’re doing is an insult to the people of Kentucky,” he said. Sheila Schuster, a longtime health care advocate in the state, said she saw it differently. “The administration has their chicken-and-egg story completely wrong — they say people need to work to get healthy,” she said. “We all know that health is the foundation from which people go to school, go to work and keep their employment. So I’m afraid the administration is not only going backward, but doing it for completely the wrong reasons.” Such opposing views were evident in comments people posted on Mr. Bevin’s Facebook page during his news conference, which was livestreamed there. “ABOUT TIME to get others to pull their weight!” one viewer in favor of the new requirements wrote. “I feel this is wrong,” another said. “Wouldn’t they not be in Medicaid if they could get a job?”\-0.2526697516441345,-0.9313451647758484,-0.214924156665802,0.7209554314613342,0.32576489448547363,-0.11269628256559372,-0.5216744542121887,0.1334666758775711,-0.7994580864906311,-0.17529445886611938,0.30667322874069214,2.303819417953491,-1.1293264627456665,0.7538189888000488,-0.7533526420593262,-0.5017465353012085,0.4980759024620056,-0.21093301475048065,-0.9425393342971802,-0.9884151220321655,-0.9058797359466553,-0.04612758755683899,0.9208428859710693,0.07525799423456192,1.2007957696914673,1.0408790111541748,-0.3294519782066345,-0.3956333100795746,-0.32614001631736755,-0.4700970947742462,-1.2243297100067139,0.9303314089775085,-0.2460515946149826,-0.7226599454879761,-0.3464495539665222,-0.10100845247507095,-0.48432213068008423,-0.5234394073486328,-0.44404667615890503,-1.271079659461975,-0.14977441728115082,0.1867598593235016,0.8862807154655457,-0.29879263043403625,0.21407662332057953,-0.03387132287025452,1.3032758235931396,-0.09419307112693787,-1.596524715423584,-0.14724864065647125,1.0176467895507812,-2.3044252395629883,-0.61851966381073,-0.7817525863647461,0.3080332279205322,-0.6533037424087524,1.1864229440689087,1.625160574913025,-1.821842908859253,1.5436956882476807,-0.6133822798728943,-0.5779026746749878,0.3803081512451172,0.7829931378364563,-0.339339017868042,-0.9310455322265625,0.603303074836731,1.9124504327774048,-1.2605024576187134,0.5869777202606201,1.9073506593704224,-0.9485089778900146,0.2503647208213806,-1.0067715644836426,-0.5629924535751343,-0.1580032855272293,-0.1500205546617508,0.9127607345581055,-0.4349818825721741,-0.9555451273918152,0.10585635155439377,-0.15201367437839508,-0.9314152598381042,0.6672396063804626,-0.9295562505722046,0.8236536979675293,-0.11802578717470169,0.2625662088394165,0.33693650364875793,-0.8500357866287231,-0.9790304899215698,0.6384449601173401,-1.9751161336898804,1.3886690139770508,-1.3344988822937012,0.555048406124115,1.873354196548462,-0.30489805340766907,-0.9492174386978149,0.10390018671751022\NYTIMES\To Get Medicaid in Kentucky, Many Will Have to Work.

1628\Science\Here’s an interplanetary botany discovery that took college students and not NASA scientists to find: Hops — the flowers used to add a pleasant bitterness to beer — grow well in Martian soil. “I don’t know if it’s a practical plant, but it’s doing fairly well,” said Edward F. Guinan, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Villanova University. Last semester, 25 students took Dr. Guinan’s class on astrobiology, about the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe. For the laboratory part of the course, the students became farmers, experimenting to see which crops might grow in Martian soil and feed future travelers there. “I was trying to come with a project for the students to do, a catchy project that would be fairly easy,” Dr. Guinan said. “I kept telling them, ‘You’re on Mars, there’s a colony there, and it’s your job to feed them. They’re all depending on you.’” Dr. Guinan presented the findings on Friday at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C. But let’s back up: soil from Mars? Of course, no one has yet brought back anything from the red planet, but spacecraft like NASA’s Phoenix Mars lander have analyzed Martian soil in great detail. Based on those measurements, scientists have come up with a reasonably good reproduction on Earth — crushed basalt from an ancient volcano in the Mojave Desert. It’s available for purchase, and Dr. Guinan bought 100 pounds. Martian soil is very dense and dries out quickly — perhaps better for making bricks than growing plants, which have trouble pushing their roots through. That includes potatoes, the savior food for the fictional Mark Watney in “The Martian,” the book by Andy Weir and later a movie starring Matt Damon about a NASA astronaut stranded on Mars. For the most part, the students chose practical, nutritious plants like soy beans and kale in addition to potatoes. Some added herbs like basil and mint so that astronauts could enjoy more flavorful food on thesolar system’s fourth world. And one group chose hops. “Because they’re students,” Dr. Guinan said. “Martian beer.” (He vetoed marijuana.) For the experiments, the students had a small patch of a greenhouse, with a mesh screen reducing the sunlight to mimic Mars’ greater distance from the sun. What did "fabulous” in pure Martian soil was mesclun, a mix of small salad greens, even without fertilizer, Dr. Guinan said. When vermiculite, a mineral often mixed in with heavy and sticky Earth soils, was added to the Martian stuff, almost all of the plants thrived. Because astronauts would likely not be hauling vermiculite from Earth but might have cardboard boxes, Dr. Guinan also tried mixing cutup cardboard into the Martian soil. That worked too. One group of students hypothesized that coffee grinds could similarly be used as a filler to loosen up the soil. They figured the astronauts would be drinking coffee anyway, and coffee would also be a natural fertilizer. “Also, it may help acidify Martian soil,” said Elizabeth Johnson, a Villanova senior who took the class. Mars soil is alkaline, with a pH of 8 to 9, she said, compared to 6 to 7 on Earth. “We think the coffee has a lot of potential,” Ms. Johnson said. Her team’s carrots, spinach and scallions sprouted quickly in the mix of coffee grounds and Martian soil, initially growing faster than even plants in a control planter full of Earth potting mix. Dr. Guinan is not the first to try growing plants in Martian soil. Five years ago, Wieger Wamelink, a scientist at Wageningen University and Research in the Netherlands had the same idea, a way to combine his work — ecology research — with his interest in science fiction. The first round of experiments grew 14 types of plants including rye, tomatoes and carrots in Martian soil, simulated lunar soil and Earth soil. Almost all of the plants germinated, Dr. Wamelink and his colleagues reported. Like Dr. Guinan, Dr. Wamelink found that mixing organic material into Martian soil greatly improved plant growth. They verified that crops grown in Martian soil were equally nutritious and safe to eat. In 2016, the researchers hosted meals cooked from their research crops for more than 50 people who had supported the work with crowdfunding donations. Last year, they showed earthworms could live, even reproduce, in Martian soil. Future experiments might grow bamboo, which could also be useful on Mars. “Not because we want panda bears over there,” Dr. Wamelink said. The shoots are edible, and “It’s also a good building material,” he said. One aspect that Dr. Guinan and Dr. Wamelink have not tackled yet is the presence on Mars of perchlorates, a poisonous chemical that causes thyroid problems in people. (For safety, the simulated Mars soil leaves that out.) It might be possible to rinse out the perchlorates, which are soluble in water. Bacteria that eat perchlorates might also be used to cleanse the soil. This semester, two Villanova astronomy students will perform follow-up experiments. That includes attempting to grow barley, the other essential ingredient for future Martian beer.\1.506877064704895,-0.17304031550884247,-0.4893696904182434,-0.38805168867111206,-1.1868430376052856,-0.12058515846729279,0.9162716865539551,1.64107084274292,-0.8281202912330627,-0.7797221541404724,0.26131537556648254,0.9546253085136414,-1.560002088546753,0.22334304451942444,-0.7285052537918091,-0.955610990524292,-0.7514864206314087,0.8151820302009583,-0.3272097110748291,0.5207327604293823,0.6788178086280823,-0.6635795831680298,0.41263651847839355,-0.7928135395050049,-0.20619434118270874,0.15391170978546143,0.8907356262207031,0.07104682177305222,1.3074984550476074,-0.19006159901618958,-0.10019562393426895,0.13173675537109375,0.031699761748313904,-0.2722088396549225,-1.4484455585479736,0.13774031400680542,-0.6173267960548401,-0.07687505334615707,0.8591113686561584,-0.2511831521987915,-0.15079721808433533,-1.8164345026016235,1.300886869430542,-0.6985098123550415,0.6119804978370667,1.2554727792739868,-0.17045092582702637,-0.25318101048469543,-1.453700065612793,-1.3245474100112915,1.191393494606018,0.6975606083869934,-1.422105073928833,-0.7159122228622437,0.22663497924804688,-0.12260368466377258,0.5863730311393738,1.563205361366272,-0.04206141084432602,0.5054150819778442,-0.789740264415741,-0.9808989763259888,0.410683810710907,-0.8448807001113892,-0.4553419351577759,-0.6013768911361694,0.9185049533843994,1.9323642253875732,-2.1356308460235596,0.6959983110427856,0.6662646532058716,-0.7696007490158081,0.3399856686592102,1.0832960605621338,-0.32695627212524414,0.16240660846233368,-0.4853641390800476,0.7157614231109619,-1.131001591682434,-1.2267837524414062,-0.6374682784080505,-0.021087802946567535,0.03514030575752258,0.7992776036262512,0.07559528201818466,-1.2783136367797852,1.6011561155319214,0.5727891325950623,1.0829017162322998,0.1432032287120819,-0.4641987681388855,1.526764988899231,-0.9953402876853943,0.7310423851013184,-0.3427126109600067,0.4534686505794525,-0.03201718628406525,-0.968535304069519,-0.8974542617797852,0.7408959865570068\NYTIMES\Trilobites: If We Ever Get to Mars, the Beer Might Not Be Bad\2018-01-12 21:15:19.0\
1629\Science\Q. Instead of sending space probes to distant planets, is it possible to land a powerful camera or another instrument on a comet or asteroid — and have it send back information as it travels through space? A. “It is certainly possible to land a camera with other instruments on a comet or asteroid to take images of that object and its surroundings,” said Lindley N. Johnson, planetary defense officer at NASA headquarters in Washington. In fact, this has already been done. “However, space is a very big place,” Mr. Johnson continued. “And even within our solar system, the comet or asteroid would almost never come close enough to a planet or another comet or asteroid to collect any images of any scientific value.” While very small asteroids do come close to Earth every week, he said, the closest that any comet or asteroid larger than one mile in size has come to Earth in the last century was still more than a million miles away, roughly four times the distance from the Earth to the Moon. The European Space Agency’s Rosetta mission landed a probe, Philae, on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2015. The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous — Shoemaker mission landed on the asteroid Eros back in 2001, he added. Other missions have briefly touched down on asteroids to collect samples from them, Mr. Johnson said, including the Japanese space agency’s Hayabusa 1 and 2 missions. NASA’s Osiris-Rex mission is to arrive at the asteroid Bennu later this year.\0.43296557664871216,0.8486243486404419,0.03184394910931587,-0.3255613148212433,0.4281981885433197,0.15485581755638123,0.43662676215171814,-0.4842621684074402,-0.4197329878807068,0.33011725544929504,-0.07940616458654404,0.9127123355865479,0.17122547328472137,-0.17869597673416138,-0.22297149896621704,0.5085089206695557,-0.07520546019077301,0.14714622497558594,0.06437725573778152,0.2197243571281433,-0.3167598247528076,-0.06716889142990112,0.9284589886665344,-0.537531852722168,-0.16089239716529846,-0.0761696919798851,1.2152342796325684,0.563831090927124,-0.032685864716768265,0.04985777288675308,0.21968580782413483,0.05433233454823494,-0.17650315165519714,-0.14054910838603973,-0.4689961075782776,0.02068253606557846,-0.0861114040017128,-0.29767343401908875,-0.19279146194458008,0.6013391017913818,-0.5384224057197571,-0.795602023601532,0.6732940077781677,0.3293834328651428,-0.1144493892788887,-0.20419816672801971,0.6139752268791199,0.45557358860969543,-0.710270345211029,0.2247805893421173,1.011672019958496,-0.4275466203689575,0.3360913395881653,-0.07443607598543167,0.5797181129455566,-0.09697141498327255,0.7358686327934265,0.12765994668006897,-0.5218001008033752,0.12256430834531784,0.30040237307548523,-0.09481515735387802,-0.028921371325850487,0.1192946806550026,-1.3898111581802368,0.4647601246833801,0.8497634530067444,0.6362349390983582,-0.9431453943252563,0.29872065782546997,-0.12813115119934082,0.10456782579421997,-0.44872456789016724,0.4816197454929352,-0.47738465666770935,0.06943827122449875,0.28581690788269043,0.18266655504703522,-0.2980973720550537,-0.15692980587482452,-0.010110176168382168,-0.24714981019496918,-0.6159515380859375,0.0724821463227272,0.21109001338481903,-0.17576219141483307,0.10293549299240112,-0.28990960121154785,-0.6033471822738647,0.06176188960671425,-0.8678247332572937,0.46406012773513794,-0.6053107976913452,0.20740316808223724,-0.40245380997657776,0.27395254373550415,-0.002676726086065173,-0.3202848434448242,-0.8878635764122009,0.3817613124847412\NYTIMES\Q&A: Eyes in the Skies\2018-01-16 17:41:35.0\
1630\Science\In 1996, when war broke out in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, just 31 northern white rhinos remained in Garamba National Park, the last stronghold of this endangered species. Armed militias reached the park less than a year later, and half of the park’s elephants, two-thirds of its buffalos and three-quarters of its hippos disappeared in three short months. Poaching of northern white rhinos also resumed, despite conservationists’ best efforts. Today, after a succession of armed clashes, only three northern white rhinos survive — all transplants from a zoo in the Czech Republic, and all confined to a single Kenyan conservancy. That the rhinos’ habitat included a part of Africa plagued by human conflict was “desperately unfortunate,” said Kes Hillman-Smith, a Nairobi-based conservationist and author of “Garamba: Conservation in Peace and War.” “The endless wars there have taken their toll on all the wildlife in the region.” Many case studies have demonstrated that war can affect the survival of local populations, sometimes threatening entire species. But the research is mixed: In some cases, conflict actually seems to aid animals. Now researchers have published a quantitative study of war’s consequences for African animals — the first multi-decade, continentwide analysis. The findings, published in Nature, are both surprising and encouraging. Compared to all other measured factors, conflict is the most consistent predictor of species declines. Yet the northern white rhino is the exception. War rarely leads to extinction, a finding that underscores the importance of post-conflict restoration efforts. “We show that war is bad, but not as bad as you might assume,” said Robert Pringle, an ecologist at Princeton University and an author of the new study. “There are really two alternative hypotheses you can imagine,” he added. “One is that war is just a disaster for everything, including environments. And the other is that pretty much anything that causes people to clear out from an area can be beneficial for wildlife.” Indeed, Dr. Pringle noted, the Demilitarized Zone between North Korea and South Korea offers respite for rare species such as red-crowned cranes and Asiatic black bears. Teaming up with Dr. Pringle, Joshua Daskin, a conservation ecologist at Yale University, undertook a laborious search of 500 scientific studies, government white papers, nonprofit reports and park management documents. He sought out comparable wildlife counts, irrespective of the presence of conflict, from 1946 to 2010. The researchers then calculated various animal population trajectories over time and compared them with known conflicts. Their final list encompassed 253 populations of 36 species of herbivorous mammals — including elephants, giraffes, zebras, hippos and wildebeests — in 126 protected areas throughout Africa. The scientists found that it takes relatively little conflict — just one event every two to five decades — to push animal populations to lower levels. “Even with the onset of what could be a fairly minor conflict from a human perspective, we see the average wildlife population declining,” Dr. Daskin said. Conflict frequency, in fact, was the most significant variable predicting wildlife trends among 10 other factors the researchers analyzed, including drought, the number of people living near a protected area and the degree of corruption found in a country. The more frequent the conflict, the greater the impact. “This continentwide assessment confirms what many case studies have hinted at — war is a major driver of wildlife population declines across Africa,” said Kaitlyn Gaynor, a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied armed conflict’s influence on wildlife. The losses are likely the result of a combination of factors, said Dr. Hillman-Smith, who spent 22 years in Garamba conserving the park and its northern white rhinos. In times of war, poached bushmeat may feed troops, local people and refugees, while valuable assets like ivory and rhino horn may be used to fund the struggle. Arms and ammunition also tend to become more widely available, Dr. Hillman-Smith said, and a general breakdown of law and order makes poaching easier. Conservation organizations, she added, also tend to pull out when the shooting starts. “The greatest losses in Garamba happened in the absence of international support and when active patrolling was stopped,” she said. “While warfare needs to be taken into account as a conservation factor, it should not be seen as a reason not to invest or to pull out too soon.” Yet all is not lost during war, even when conservationists are forced to flee. Animals sometimes become scarcer and more difficult for hunters to find, Dr. Daskin said, and the populations persist at lower levels. That conflict is detrimental to wildlife but rarely causes extinctions is the most important message of the paper, according to Edd Hammill, an ecologist at Utah State University, who was not involved in the research. The finding suggests that rapid intervention by conservationists can be critical for ensuring the survival and recovery of remnant populations, he said. Indeed, in the 1980s post-conflict conservation in Garamba doubled both the northern white rhino and elephant populations in just eight years. Renewed fighting, politics and other factors ultimately prevented the northern white rhino’s recovery in the wild. But Dr. Daskin points to Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park as a hopeful alternative. Following 15 years of devastating civil war, Gorongosa lost more than 90 percent of its animals. The elephant population declined to 200 from 2,000, while wildebeest and zebras numbered fewer than 50 each, down from several thousand. As herbivores disappeared, trees encroached into the park’s formerly open grasslands, and predators became virtually nonexistent. After peace was declared, the Mozambique government partnered with the Carr Foundation to restore the park. Rangers — including people who were previously pitted against one another in the civil war — were recruited and trained to reduce poaching and look after the animals. Those living around the park received assistance for farming, education and health care. Several hundred also found jobs in the park. Gorongosa now bills itself as “Africa’s greatest wildlife restoration story,” with more than 500 elephants, 60 lions and tens of thousands of antelopes. The lesson? “Within a decadal time scale, it is possible to rehabilitate even a severely degraded ecosystem into something that is once again a natural wonder of the world,” Dr. Pringle said.\0.8969446420669556,0.231237530708313,-1.07852041721344,0.9103859663009644,-1.3136652708053589,0.5426812767982483,0.407617449760437,-2.0295205116271973,-0.7333964705467224,-0.20893503725528717,0.20501244068145752,1.409252405166626,-0.12826618552207947,0.4620233476161957,-0.5331614017486572,-0.0061079515144228935,0.6980993151664734,-0.31576454639434814,-0.24565823376178741,-0.26654958724975586,0.13446493446826935,-0.12762029469013214,0.4996650516986847,-0.29525986313819885,-1.1331145763397217,0.8031120300292969,0.6646945476531982,0.25374919176101685,0.14471730589866638,0.21870273351669312,-1.1975139379501343,0.44184088706970215,-0.5760510563850403,0.8733325600624084,-0.6703713536262512,-1.0307042598724365,0.43315139412879944,0.7711911797523499,0.8016561269760132,-0.22782452404499054,-0.09996190667152405,-2.4662883281707764,0.5303923487663269,-0.6704250574111938,-0.14926442503929138,1.8302202224731445,0.2790561020374298,-0.05539917200803757,-0.845999002456665,-0.7501776218414307,1.330814242362976,0.09121338278055191,-0.008302373811602592,-0.05952036380767822,-0.310508131980896,-0.9488932490348816,1.601680040359497,0.49446871876716614,-0.6421365737915039,0.7975088357925415,0.6329901218414307,-0.5050479769706726,0.8303291201591492,0.334877073764801,0.7165983319282532,0.20798705518245697,1.1978704929351807,1.791008472442627,-0.8113207817077637,0.27509790658950806,1.8325741291046143,-0.046897001564502716,0.11329270899295807,0.38505882024765015,-0.1277054250240326,0.33096882700920105,-0.14393842220306396,-0.6553259491920471,-0.6254675984382629,-0.3068760633468628,-0.9831805229187012,-0.25374916195869446,-0.656123697757721,0.4358636736869812,-0.016009585931897163,0.4677935540676117,1.2487108707427979,0.345441609621048,0.6932046413421631,-0.06665529310703278,-0.30589956045150757,0.8920215368270874,-0.23254616558551788,1.1594685316085815,0.09215928614139557,1.6913014650344849,0.6385217905044556,-0.6859923601150513,-0.9621888399124146,0.5006682872772217\NYTIMES\War’s Other Victims: Animals\2018-01-13 16:06:30.0\
1631\Science\Some creepy facts: A cockroach can live about a month with its head cut off. In its 300 million or so years on this planet, its relatives have survived an asteroid that wiped out dinosaurs, an ice age and an atom bomb. These vile pests the color of excrement reproduce all year and know where to find warm places to hide. So that “bomb cyclone” of a cold spell that froze much of the United States? It’s like nothing for the roaches — or most other creepy-crawly pests. Yes, it’s been cold, really cold — but you survived. Don’t think your worst nightmares didn’t. “I don’t expect this cold spell to affect bedbug populations in the coming months,” said Jeff White, an entomologist at BedBug Central, a company that provides training and information on bedbugs and pest control. “Although it’s cold outside, it’s not cold inside.” According to Mr. White, you’d have to leave a book in your freezer for up to two weeks to make sure the cold fully penetrated it to kill bedbugs. But the cold we just experienced didn’t last that long and many things bedbugs might use as shelter are bigger than books. “Cold is widely thought of as a fairly ineffective way to deal with bed bugs,” said Mr. White. Even a prolonged polar-vortex-bomb-cyclone death trap probably wouldn’t be enough. Mr. White said he once received an email from someone who tried to freeze bedbugs out of a sofa on a snowbank in a super cold Canadian city. Three months later, they were still alive. If the cold snap persisted, you might be surprised to learn that you’ll see more of certain home invaders in the spring, said Richard Cooper, another entomologist at BedBug Central. That’s the case for crickets, ants, wasps, ladybugs or stink bugs that generally live outside and creep in only on occasion. That’s because many adult insects sleep off winter in dormancy. A warm winter or a winter with a lot of ups and downs can break that dormancy and trick these pests into coming out too soon, much like flowers that bloom too early during a winter warm spell. Those insects then have a greater chance of dying before ever seeing spring. Can’t we at least tell you that the “bomb cyclone” killed off some ticks? Probably not, said Thomas Mather, “The Tick Guy,” an entomologist at the University of Rhode Island who directs their TickEncounter Resource Center. Put a deer tick — the kind that carries the bacteria that causes Lyme disease — in a freezer overnight, and that sucker will die. But give it a night outside in well below freezing temperatures under some snow, and in the morning its writhing, living body will greet you. Dr. Mather demonstrated this during the recent cold snap. In the Northeast, adult deer tick populations start peaking after the first frost: “Right away they’re sort of showing, ‘I’m not afraid of the cold,’” said Dr. Mather. That’s because they have survival tricks. A tick dies moving from a warm room to a freezer because water in its cells freezes, crystallizes and breaks its cell membranes. But ticks acclimate outside where temperature changes more gradually. With time, they move water out of their cells before it ruptures them. Other outdoor critters can produce antifreeze proteins. Ticks also escape cold temperatures by insulating themselves beneath a blanket of leaf litter and snow. Polar vortex, bomb cyclone, cold snap — whatever you call it — it hasn’t affected spring tick populations before, and it probably won’t now, according to Dr. Mather. “These bugs have been around longer than people, and they probably have gone through cold temperatures before,” Dr. Mather said. If they hadn’t survived, “we would have called them extinct.”\1.017397165298462,0.18251363933086395,-1.4446378946304321,1.0138108730316162,-0.7490081191062927,0.9318934082984924,1.2434301376342773,0.10929501801729202,-0.7830991744995117,-0.2980422079563141,-0.20422963798046112,0.751335620880127,-0.5571709275245667,0.6008148193359375,-0.6919974088668823,-0.319004088640213,-0.5605751872062683,1.2034478187561035,0.5438739657402039,-0.11866821348667145,-0.6765882968902588,-0.15674366056919098,0.8700506091117859,-0.9497454762458801,-0.6239538788795471,0.672529399394989,1.3856183290481567,1.3197194337844849,-0.25486841797828674,0.6668297052383423,0.02888588048517704,1.966881275177002,0.4221676290035248,-0.14382028579711914,0.5425894856452942,-1.1879408359527588,-1.052958607673645,-0.5230491757392883,-1.275825023651123,0.5929703712463379,0.28012344241142273,-2.5887598991394043,1.409505009651184,0.5339456796646118,-0.9141044020652771,-0.07152056694030762,1.2600666284561157,-1.6300404071807861,-0.9761400818824768,-0.015877505764365196,0.5531224012374878,-0.48874542117118835,-0.5781201124191284,-0.8526546359062195,-0.1818126142024994,-0.06147666648030281,2.4287867546081543,0.7091124653816223,0.08055360615253448,1.180503249168396,0.14543113112449646,-0.6560930609703064,0.4430285096168518,-0.4875728189945221,-0.5443198084831238,-0.17832176387310028,-0.021290911361575127,1.1016169786453247,-2.2801430225372314,0.02481825277209282,1.0851099491119385,1.6520531177520752,-1.0442336797714233,-0.20600606501102448,0.25376054644584656,-0.573741614818573,0.19127845764160156,0.9121178984642029,-0.9639725685119629,-0.6222524046897888,0.31790661811828613,-0.02317022904753685,-1.037552833557129,0.40887123346328735,-0.22707100212574005,-0.2274060696363449,0.8507710099220276,0.8248270153999329,0.7026249170303345,0.014560500159859657,-1.5469393730163574,0.47889384627342224,-0.667433500289917,0.3598237931728363,0.013340135104954243,1.178122639656067,0.45658862590789795,0.12095271050930023,-1.4839887619018555,1.6897999048233032\NYTIMES\Trilobites: You Won’t Like This News About Bedbugs, Ticks and the ‘Bomb Cyclone’\2018-01-17 16:25:01.0\

Climate change has made severe cold spells like the one that recently gripped the Northeast far less common than they used to be, a team of researchers has found. The reason is straightforward: The Arctic has warmed so much — twice as fast in recent decades than other parts of the world — that when polar air descends to lower latitudes, the cold snaps are warmer on average. So a spell of extremely cold weather like the recent one is rare, about 15 times rarer than a century ago, the scientists said. “Although this cold spell would not have been unusual before global warming, it is now a relatively rare event in any one region,” the study’s authors, from a loose-knit international group called World Weather Attribution, wrote. Put another way, the most intense cold waves are on average about 4 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) warmer now than previously, they said. “The trend in general for these cold waves is that they’re warming,” said Claudia Tebaldi, a research fellow with Climate Central, a news organization that focuses on climate science and coordinated the study. But Dr. Tebaldi, a statistician who lives in Colorado, where she works at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, acknowledged that the study might provide little comfort to Northeasterners who experienced the bone-chilling cold during the last week of December and the first week of January. While Arctic air is milder because of climate change, the question of whether global warming is actually leading to more cold spells has been much debated. Some recent studies have suggested that the loss of Arctic sea ice because of warming could be a factor, by influencing air circulation patterns, weakening the jet stream and allowing more polar air to shift southward, at least in some regions. But Dr. Tebaldi said her group’s study found no connection to sea-ice loss. World Weather Attribution is one of a number of scientific teams that in recent years has begun to analyze weather events for signs of the influence of climate change. The group, with members from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, Princeton University and other institutions as well as Climate Central, has found that global warming increased the likelihood of Hurricane Harvey’s torrential rains, a heat wave in Australia and other events. But some analyses have found little or no effect of climate change, including one of a Somali drought in 2016-17. The idea behind such rapid studies is to get scientific analysis to the public as soon as possible after an event. In this case, Dr. Tebaldi said, the analysis was even more rapid than usual — published just three days after the cold spell ended — because the researchers used methodologies that had already been developed, and because the study relied only on observations, not on computer models that can take time to run.\1.4770179986953735,0.6301791071891785,-0.45055365562438965,0.09027571976184845,-0.7088788747787476,1.4429818391799927,1.3502495288848877,-0.3889221251010895,-1.3579901456832886,-0.717981219291687,0.1461382359266281,0.8827598094940186,-1.4157423973083496,0.629169225692749,-1.1133623123168945,0.12492471188306808,0.4892553687095642,0.7117043733596802,0.6295488476753235,-0.11809083074331284,0.05332912504673004,0.8982382416725159,-0.24785378575325012,-0.824907660484314,-0.8892178535461426,0.4075542986392975,1.0840083360671997,-0.10097122937440872,-0.37586715817451477,-0.15292896330356598,0.31833818554878235,1.369918942451477,-1.0145773887634277,-0.274067223072052,0.028196724131703377,0.0993180200457573,-0.37390100955963135,0.6664054989814758,0.13476718962192535,-0.1423284262418747,-0.430392324924469,-2.2304489612579346,0.5961368680000305,-1.0019617080688477,0.5819499492645264,0.045341286808252335,0.5139369368553162,-0.10396530479192734,-0.6719123125076294,-0.26538175344467163,1.2127655744552612,0.18358325958251953,0.8212859034538269,0.6842222213745117,0.11562658101320267,-0.6475206017494202,0.45969241857528687,1.5495026111602783,-0.2523014545440674,-0.14077207446098328,0.733652651309967,-0.24202221632003784,0.48088306188583374,-7.487201946787536E-4,-0.28557315468788147,-0.24272236227989197,0.25812312960624695,1.0373759269714355,0.40510520339012146,0.8318486213684082,0.7958106398582458,0.7594894170761108,-0.3012590706348419,0.25954964756965637,0.4968906044960022,-1.290145754814148,0.4352382719516754,1.1730097532272339,-1.0178247690200806,-0.7126321792602539,-0.08999578654766083,-0.5746157169342041,-0.5777968168258667,1.7467056512832642,0.5902866721153259,-0.9234976768493652,1.0986984968185425,1.0044301748275757,0.5849109888076782,-0.7231760621070862,-0.9935080409049988,-0.1851416975259781,-0.4698420763015747,0.8010453581809998,-0.12675942480564117,0.5253975987434387,0.4384493827819824,-0.869081974029541,-0.13184627890586853,-0.3115851879119873\NYTIMES\That Recent Brutally Cold Weather?

1633\Science\Say hello to Riley. He is a good boy. Riley, a 12-week-old Weimaraner, is hardly the first pup to have job responsibilities far beyond “fetch” and “sit” and “get off the couch.” But he appears to be the first to be trained specifically to detect moths and other pests that could damage high-value artwork in a museum. “It’s really a trial, pilot project. We don’t know if he’s going to be good at it,” said Katie Getchell, the deputy director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. “But it seems like a great idea to try.” No technology is as powerful at detecting scents as the nostrils of dogs, which have long been trained to use their superior schnozzes to sniff out explosives, cadavers, bed bugs, ants and cancer, among other things. An employee at the museum, Nicki Luongo, has trained police dogs on her own time, and got Riley as a family pet, Ms. Getchell said. They wondered: Could Ms. Luongo train Riley to detect insects that tend to eat through textiles and wood when given the chance? If so, it would be another layer of defense against critters that can pose a long-term threat to the artwork. As is, the museum has a variety of pest-control tactics, including quarantining new artwork before it’s placed in galleries. But no amount of prevention tactics can change the fact that the museum has more than 1 million people passing through each year. Moths and other bugs might occasionally hitch a ride on a visitor’s coat, or be attracted to the food-preparation areas. According to Pepe Peruyero, who runs a dog-training company called Pepedogs, the museum’s plan is entirely plausible. “Every insect we’ve been able to work with, we’ve been able to train dogs to accurately and consistently detect them,” he said. Generally, dogs are trained to recognize scents much the same way you might train your dog to sit: By offering a reward. When dogs associate a scent with getting a reward, they become adept at seeking the scent out. The challenge then becomes getting the dogs to alert humans once they’ve discovered the scent. In the museum’s case, Riley will be trained to learn specific bugs’ scents, then sit in front of artwork when he catches a whiff. Humans could then follow up and check on pieces where bugs might be hiding. While Mr. Peruyero wasn’t aware of any museums that have used dogs for pest control, he said there was a wide variety of ways humans had harnessed canine honkers. His company has trained dogs to discover sea turtle eggs buried under three feet of sand and identify scat from bears. They’ve used dogs to find larvae on golf courses more than six months before they’d hatch and destroy the turf. And utility companies have trained dogs to detect the signature odors of natural gas to detect pipeline leaks. If Riley is successful, museum officials would attempt to share what they learn with other museums and organizations that need to protect textiles, Ms. Getchell said. But visitors shouldn’t expect to see Riley wandering the exhibits. Ms. Getchell said he’ll do his work behind the scenes, exploring public areas only during off-hours. That said, museum employees have been overwhelmed by the positive response after Riley was introduced to local media. They don’t want to distract from the museum experience and create a carnival atmosphere, but they’re already wondering if they can find ways to please Riley’s fans. Meet-and-greets? An Instagram account? “The staff are overwhelmed by the excitement to see and meet him,” Ms. Getchell said. “We don’t want to deprive the public of that.”\0.7146316170692444,0.4656679332256317,-1.1946443319320679,-1.3796331882476807,-0.5490975379943848,0.5433404445648193,1.01047682762146,-0.03444288671016693,-0.993301510810852,0.2962910830974579,-0.1745130866765976,0.629210889339447,0.05578937381505966,0.8828915357589722,-0.03674021735787392,0.19748733937740326,-1.3953967094421387,0.5592373013496399,-0.36724814772605896,0.5271632671356201,0.3392513692378998,-0.2474338859319687,0.46853598952293396,-0.5098967552185059,-0.3572268486022949,0.4748183786869049,0.010880861431360245,0.552573025226593,0.17762574553489685,0.23879337310791016,0.11668508499860764,1.008571743965149,0.36123892664909363,0.12238401919603348,-0.4312201142311096,-1.4625800848007202,0.22496064007282257,-0.5367900133132935,0.7268803119659424,-0.6603350043296814,0.44218194484710693,-0.9093877077102661,1.0401244163513184,0.06403075158596039,-0.025678055360913277,0.7525595426559448,0.8525493741035461,-0.23631717264652252,-1.0863703489303589,-1.0034658908843994,1.6501319408416748,-0.7055817246437073,-0.9159992337226868,-0.15406616032123566,1.0689018964767456,-0.7304441928863525,0.6971003413200378,-0.18453538417816162,-0.3561929762363434,1.4603664875030518,-0.30704718828201294,-0.2960045039653778,-0.06646494567394257,-0.043776705861091614,-0.5690546631813049,-0.16882503032684326,-0.016732022166252136,1.4299285411834717,-1.6018718481063843,0.4257490932941437,0.3983335793018341,0.10334724932909012,-0.822063148021698,0.17037218809127808,-0.6110758185386658,0.6977638602256775,-0.5194666385650635,0.8064548969268799,-0.4398233890533447,-0.7829412817955017,-0.13308532536029816,-0.21374104917049408,-1.5974637269973755,1.8908594846725464,0.6264467835426331,0.8395395874977112,0.4168110489845276,0.3084321618080139,0.48130151629447937,-0.28532689809799194,-0.4046154022216797,0.19244089722633362,-0.7444952130317688,0.6958805918693542,-1.3751914501190186,-0.014934863895177841,0.18153920769691467,-0.07014750689268112,-1.7590768337249756,0.8162699937820435\NYTIMES\Boston Museum Tries New System for Protecting Artwork: A Dog’s Nose\2018-01-11 18:24:13.0\
1634\Science\To scientists who study lakes and rivers, it seems humans have embarked on a huge unplanned experiment. By burning fossil fuels, we have already raised the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by 40 percent, and we’re on track to increase it by much more. Some of that gas may mix into the world’s inland waters, and recent studies hint that this may have profound effects on the species that live in them. “We’re monkeying with the very chemical foundation of these ecosystems,” said Emily H. Stanley, a limnologist (freshwater ecologist) at the University of Wisconsin — Madison. “But right now we don’t know enough yet to know where we’re going. To me, scientifically that’s really interesting, and as a human a little bit frightening.” Scientists began taking continuous measurements of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the 1950s, and today they have more than six decades of consistent readings. In the 1980s, oceanographers followed suit, developing carbon dioxide sensors and deploying them across the planet. Over the past three decades, they’ve chronicled a steady rise of carbon dioxide in seawater. The increasing concentration can harm marine life in many ways. It lowers the pH of seawater, for one thing, making it more acidic and interfering with the chemistry that coral, for instance, use to build their calcium skeletons. Ocean acidification also thins the shells of oysters and other animals. Many marine organisms rely on chemical changes in water to find food and avoid danger. “Many fish are not able to detect their predators anymore,” said Linda C. Weiss, an aquatic ecologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. “They can even get more bold.” Dr. Weiss first came to appreciate the impact of ocean acidification in 2010, when she spent time at a marine research station in Australia. The experience left her wondering if lakes and rivers might face a similar threat. Her first step was to look for historical data about carbon dioxide levels in fresh water. But a literature search brought her to a surprising conclusion. “I discovered there was no information,” she said. Traditionally, scientists who have studied inland waters have focused on different questions. They’ve been more concerned, for example, with sulfuric acid and other pollutants in acid rain, along with the impacts of runoff from farms and yards. Now that researchers have grown concerned about carbon dioxide levels, they’ve been developing ways to reconstruct their history. The level of carbon dioxide in a lake depends on such variables as its temperature and how much organic carbon it contains. If those factors have been tracked in the past, scientists can use them to get an estimate of a lake’s carbon dioxide level, too. Dr. Weiss and her colleagues used this method to figure out the carbon dioxide levels in four reservoirs in Germany from 1981 to 2015. They reported Thursday in the journal Current Biology that the amounts tripled in that time. “We didn’t really know what to expect,” said Dr. Weiss. “But the speed of acidification we find is quite fast.” The researchers wondered what effects this fast rise in carbon dioxide might have on freshwater life in decades to come. So they ran experiments on the humble water flea. These tiny, shrimplike creatures filter algae and microbes from water. They are devoured in turn by small fish, which are eaten by bigger fish. If rising carbon dioxide were to affect water fleas, Dr. Weiss reasoned, it could influence the entire lake ecosystem. Water fleas use a bizarre but sophisticated defense to escape predators. They can sense chemicals given off by fish in their vicinity, and in response they make themselves harder to eat. Some species grow a massive crest on their head, while others sprout spikes. Dr. Weiss and her colleagues found that high levels of carbon dioxide caused water fleas to make smaller crests and shorter spikes. Rather than the acidity of the water, carbon dioxide itself seems to be affecting the water fleas. When the researchers lowered the pH with hydrochloric acid, the water fleas responded normally to predators. Dr. Weiss hypothesized that carbon dioxide interferes with the nervous system of the water fleas, blunting their ability to look out for predators. Caleb T. Hasler, a biologist at the University of Winnipeg, said that the new research addressed an unanswered question: the amounts of carbon dioxide that might harm freshwater life. “This paper is really important because it starts to show where those levels might be,” he said. Dr. Hasler’s own recent research hints that water fleas may not be the only freshwater animals to be altered by carbon dioxide. He and his colleagues studied minnows swimming in water rich with carbon dioxide and found that the fish don’t respond as quickly to alarm signals released by other minnows. In another study, the team studied two species of mussels. One species relaxed its muscles in water high in carbon dioxide, so that its shell gaped open. The other species clamped its shell shut, so that it could no longer filter food. These sorts of changes may send ripples out across entire freshwater ecosystems. Mussels are vital for filtering food and keeping water clear, for example. If water fleas do a worse job of escaping predators, their population may decline, leaving less food in the long run for fish. But it’s not certain that inland waters around the world are building up carbon dioxide at the rate that Dr. Weiss and her colleagues observed in the German reservoirs. In November, Dr. Stanley and her colleagues published a study of carbon dioxide levels in lakes in Wisconsin. Between 1986 and 2011, they detected no significant change at all. The mismatch points to the complex chemistry varying from one lake to the next. While lakes and rivers all absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, some also draw in the gas from surrounding soils. The chemistry of some inland waters causes a lot of carbon dioxide to be converted into other compounds. Some lakes and streams may support a lot of underwater plants that take up the gas, for instance, while others may have microbes can release more of it. Making matters even more complicated, the carbon dioxide levels in any particular body of freshwater can change drastically over time with swings in temperature and other conditions. “You can have lakes where the carbon dioxide increases tenfold at night,” said Dr. Hasler. In decades to come, as carbon dioxide levels continue to climb in the atmosphere, Dr. Stanley speculated, the picture will only get more nuanced. “I honestly don’t know where we’re going,” said Dr. Stanley. “I’ll probably put my money on increased variability from lake to lake. They’re just going to be more extreme.” Dr. Weiss agreed that it wasn’t possible to draw big lessons from the preliminary data. “I think this study we’re publishing is like a door-opener,” she said. “I hope there will be other scientists who will follow.”\0.17927852272987366,0.5669485926628113,-1.4300966262817383,0.4356738030910492,-1.7163877487182617,1.7644493579864502,1.6841961145401,-1.0087848901748657,-0.9578068256378174,-0.08381341397762299,0.2357150763273239,1.4031646251678467,-0.4023171663284302,-0.10370256751775742,-0.5297943353652954,0.05167214199900627,0.07751139253377914,-0.09901618212461472,-1.1188234090805054,-0.2845059037208557,-0.4200308918952942,0.047027379274368286,0.3431929051876068,-1.3423724174499512,0.05792435258626938,0.03221582993865013,1.5612295866012573,-0.4121217131614685,0.08398155868053436,0.21727348864078522,-0.6521123051643372,0.09944256395101547,-0.562657356262207,-0.2387230545282364,-0.18053844571113586,-1.664186716079712,-0.31710660457611084,-0.6444181203842163,0.5322341918945312,0.9389060139656067,-0.6460283994674683,-1.3587361574172974,0.2860262095928192,-0.4948984384536743,-0.2447023242712021,0.5514429807662964,0.2051607072353363,-0.37340879440307617,-0.8603305816650391,-0.8963178992271423,-0.02033417671918869,0.5823317170143127,-1.1311843395233154,0.41625720262527466,-0.6664044857025146,-0.5757364630699158,0.9430949687957764,1.6081392765045166,-0.026076415553689003,1.6927913427352905,-0.9769684672355652,0.1768006831407547,-0.17005795240402222,-1.2490402460098267,0.7086979746818542,-0.896992564201355,1.2791821956634521,2.0330114364624023,-0.4740309715270996,1.1910103559494019,0.33887770771980286,1.354135513305664,0.4422079622745514,0.7261518836021423,0.7392495274543762,1.1448562145233154,-1.23216712474823,1.663232684135437,-1.5014517307281494,-1.1168279647827148,-0.5387818217277527,-0.941458523273468,-1.6855841875076294,0.6612507700920105,0.4830993711948395,-1.4059596061706543,0.6911888718605042,-0.9276923537254333,0.505005419254303,-0.950249433517456,-1.3273539543151855,2.2492880821228027,-0.48682913184165955,1.645550012588501,0.3768818974494934,0.9662473201751709,0.1803874969482422,0.04401148855686188,-1.3369051218032837,1.4742355346679688\NYTIMES\Matter: Climate Change Is Altering Lakes and Streams, Study Suggests\2018-01-11 18:00:16.0\
1635\Politics\Washington (CNN)Politicians -- good ones, at least -- make their bones by knowing which way the wind is blowing. And right now, it's a gale force gust right in the faces of Republicans. Facing such perilous conditions, lots and lots of Republicans are steering toward calmer shores. In the House, senior Republicans -- including eight committee chairs -- are choosing to retire rather than running for re-election in November's midterm elections. In Senate battleground states, the top GOP prospects -- most recently former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty -- are declining pleas from President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to take on vulnerable Democratic incumbents. Taken together, the developments on both sides of Capitol Hill suggest that Republicans view the coming midterm election as a sort of stay-away endeavor at best. The combination of historical trends for a president's party in his first midterm (not good), the relative apathy of the GOP base (even worse) and Trump's approval rating (historically low) has created an environment in which sitting on the sidelines looks much more appealing to ambitious Republicans than running and losing. The signs of trouble for Republicans are coming directly from Trump country. Democrat Patty Schactner won a western Wisconsin state Senate special election on Tuesday in a district where Trump bested Hillary Clinton in 2016 by 16 percentage points. "You cannot be openly and intentionally mean and not expect a little pushback," said Schachtner of the political environment. "We all know when enough is enough." Even Republicans acknowledged the obvious. Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who won three contentious elections there, including a labor union-fueled recall, went on a tweetstorm Wednesday, calling the result a "wake up call."  It's not just Wisconsin. In Virginia, Democrats flipped 15 Republican seats in the November 2017 election. A 16th seat ended tied but Republicans retained control after their candidate won a drawing of lots. In Oklahoma -- not exactly a Democrat-friendly state -- Democrats nonetheless picked up three GOP-held state legislative seats last year. In New Hampshire, two GOP seats flipped in September. The trend exists statewide as well. In Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, won by a larger-than-expected margin thanks to sky-high Democratic turnout last November. In Alabama, Doug Jones became the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in the state since 1992 -- buoyed by massive African-American turnout. Trump making it difficult for the GOP GOP operatives involved in 2018 races say that as Trump's self-made controversies siphon attention away from the economy, they are increasingly concerned they won't be able to sell their own message in a way that convinces voters to see the midterm election as anything but a referendum on Trump. Though 2018 is shaping up as a referendum on Trump, the President's own ability to form the 2018 battleground map has proven limited despite the fact that Democrats are defending 26 Senate seats -- including 10 in states Trump won in 2016. Republicans involved in midterm races said that early in Trump's presidency -- a key period for 2018 recruiting -- the White House political operation was a disaster, missing important opportunities to court candidates and reassure those skeptical about the political environment. The operation, those Republicans said, has improved in the last three months or so -- but it's been too little, too late. In recent weeks, Trump courted Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, urging the 84-year-old to run for another term. Instead, Hatch opted for retirement, opening the door for a Senate run by one of Trump's fiercest intra-party critics, Mitt Romney. Romney is expected to run and would begin the race as a heavy favorite to come to Washington. Trump also met with Rep. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota in a bid to woo him into a race against Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. Days later, Cramer declined. A senior House Republican acknowledged the obvious -- that things are difficult -- but said the picture isn't as dire as Democrats would hope for the GOP. "The challenging political environment undoubtedly makes recruitment and retention a tough chore for Republicans in 2018," the lawmaker said. "However it can be overstated. The vast majority of Republican retirements are in safe seats and many are due to members running for higher office or being termed out of their committee chairmanships. Retirements are a bigger problem if you lose the majority than they are while you retain it." Trump states where Republicans are having problems In addition to North Dakota, Republicans have faced less-than-ideal circumstances in seven of the nine Trump-won states where Democrats are up for re-election: -- Montana: Rep. Greg Gianforte's political future was clouded by his bodyslam of a journalist. Gianforte was expected to run for governor in 2020 -- but with him seemingly out of the picture, other Republicans who might have run for the Senate in 2018, particularly Attorney General Tim Fox, changed their calculations. -- Ohio: Rep. Pat Tiberi passed on a Senate run not once but twice -- the second time after state Treasurer Josh Mandel bowed out suddenly this month, leaving Republicans scrambling for a candidate. Retiring Rep. Jim Renacci eventually stepped into the void, switching from the governor's race to the Senate contest. -- Wisconsin: Rep. Sean Duffy passed, as did several other higher-profile potential GOP recruits, leading to a big primary field of lesser-known candidates. -- Missouri: Rep. Ann Wagner declined what had long been expected would be a matchup with Sen. Claire McCaskill. The GOP is high on Attorney General Josh Hawley -- many operatives believe he's a better candidate than Wagner would have been -- but he was just elected to statewide office for the first time in 2016. -- Pennsylvania: Rep. Pat Meehan passed on the Senate race, leaving Republicans with Rep. Lou Barletta, a Trump ally in a year where that's a politically damaging label. -- Michigan: Statewide elected officials like Lt. Gov. Brian Calley and Attorney General Bill Schuette are angling for the governor's office, and Rep. Fred Upton passed on a Senate run. -- Indiana: Rep. Susan Brooks passed on a Senate run, though the GOP isn't really hurting there with Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer in. West Virginia, where Rep. Evan Jenkins and Attorney General Patrick Morissey are running, is the only state where Republicans haven't struggled to recruit their first choice. But they will have a very costly -- and likely nasty -- primary fight. The next state to watch is Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott remains undecided on whether he'll challenge Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. If Scott says "no" -- and there is some muttering he might be less gung ho on the race than he was a few months ago -- it would be a massive blow to Republicans' hopes of expanding their Senate majority. \-0.8776957392692566,-0.051834385842084885,-1.7974214553833008,-0.25638383626937866,0.33474329113960266,-0.2180299460887909,2.2673659324645996,1.6442569494247437,-1.4324800968170166,0.9560461044311523,0.6093369722366333,0.7029207944869995,-0.4275992810726166,1.2490267753601074,-0.4278760254383087,0.6385054588317871,-0.02601216919720173,-0.15464098751544952,-2.048150062561035,-0.35930895805358887,0.7293538451194763,-1.0434505939483643,-0.4145629405975342,-0.007892625406384468,-0.5580704212188721,0.04404144734144211,0.716740071773529,0.3060332238674164,-1.0350006818771362,-0.07951466739177704,0.5274819135665894,0.23125028610229492,-0.056393928825855255,-0.14652930200099945,0.1758599728345871,0.592583954334259,-0.626672625541687,-0.2393246293067932,1.0029107332229614,-1.7700483798980713,-0.4555318057537079,-1.6387385129928589,0.15559904277324677,-0.5508299469947815,-0.04608381912112236,1.3853927850723267,1.0428645610809326,0.05433840677142143,-0.6634712815284729,-0.90256667137146,1.268133282661438,0.7952762842178345,0.2346784770488739,-0.4934684634208679,0.9498931765556335,-2.1370959281921387,0.8961892127990723,-0.24584807455539703,-1.6320066452026367,0.18984507024288177,-1.0437768697738647,-0.14786368608474731,1.896286964416504,-0.7920171022415161,-2.5061967372894287,-0.37307265400886536,1.3862519264221191,1.7022587060928345,-1.2124985456466675,2.254451274871826,2.4308552742004395,-0.21059472858905792,-0.8346331715583801,1.8094934225082397,-0.606788158416748,0.5561392903327942,-0.1281462013721466,-0.2705306112766266,0.014495784416794777,0.402133047580719,-0.7154800891876221,-1.1424853801727295,-2.338487148284912,0.32439592480659485,0.05853089690208435,-1.2316440343856812,1.9789355993270874,1.659079670906067,-0.8421759605407715,-0.5192294716835022,-1.2589625120162964,0.7156216502189636,-2.5585684776306152,0.1524704545736313,0.45398345589637756,0.7553640007972717,-1.0868757963180542,-1.630979299545288,-2.061528205871582,-0.962344765663147\CNN\Fearing Trump blowback, Republicans say 'no thanks' to 2018\2018-01-18 15:34:06.0\
1636\Politics\(CNN)House Republican leaders are moving toward a vote Thursday to avoid a shutdown, but it's unclear if there are enough GOP votes or if President Donald Trump's tweets could derail their efforts. House Speaker Paul Ryan and his lieutenants were up against the clock and their own ranks as they scrambled to lock down votes, and that was before Trump tweeted that a key sweetener for Senate Democrats -- a six-year reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program -- shouldn't be included in a short-term measure. If Congress doesn't send a bill to the President approving more money by midnight on Friday, most federal agencies will be forced to stop operations. GOP leaders in the House can't count on Democrats who have said they will not support a short-term spending bill that funds the government into mid-February if it does not include a fix for DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that expires in March. That left Ryan looking to pass the spending bill with just Republican votes. A White House official told CNN that the President will put pressure on Democrats over funding the government, highlighting the impact on the military of failing to fund the government during his visit to the Pentagon later Thursday. "We do feel good" about the the prospects for the short-term funding bill the House will take up Thursday, the official said. But this person noted that they recognize that it is a "tough vote" for Republicans. These comments came before Trump's CHIP tweet. Republicans, including those inside the Trump administration, had planned to use funding for children's health care program to woo Democratic votes for the short-term spending bill. Asked whether Trump should be held responsible for a shutdown if one occurs, the White House official noted that Trump has been advocating for funding the government, and especially the military, for weeks. "Should he be held responsible for a shutdown? I don't think so," the official said. How will conservative House members vote? For House Republicans, some of their own conservative members are still a major question mark. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, is one of a small group of conservatives opposed to the short-term funding bill and told reporters Wednesday he didn't believe GOP leaders had the votes to pass it because of the internal divisions. He didn't rule out supporting it, saying he spoke to President Donald Trump and met with the chief deputy whip, Rep. Patrick McHenry, a fellow GOP North Carolinian. Asked about Meadows' saying he's a no and others in the Freedom caucus planning to oppose the bill, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California tweaked his GOP colleagues, saying "they want a shutdown? I don't think they'd want to shut down." 'What other choice do have this week' While reluctant to pass yet another short-term continuing resolution or "CR" -- the fourth in just months -- many rank-and-file members seemed mostly resigned Wednesday to the fact that it was the only option, even if they were not happy about it. "What other choice do have this week," asked New Jersey Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur. "I'm certainly not going to vote to shut the government down. That's irresponsible." During a closed-door meeting Wednesday morning, GOP leaders made the pitch that the stopgap bill was the only path to keeping talks going on a broader budget deal and a separate effort to come up with a bipartisan compromise on DACA. Without a unified Republican conference heading into that vote, leaders would be forced to give concessions to Democrats in order to get their support and avoid any shutdown. "There seemed to be a consensus with the cards that we have that this is the best way to play it," North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Walker said after the meeting. He called the latest short term bill "a proverbial crap sandwich," but said at this juncture he supported it. As the afternoon wore on and leaders surveyed GOP lawmakers, one member of the Republican Whip team told CNN that things were going in the right direction. Republicans added sweeteners to the bill, hoping to make it tough for Democrats to oppose it. They tacked on a six-year extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program, a popular program that some states say is close to running out of money. They also delayed some taxes from the Affordable Care Act -- one on medical devices and another on high-cost, so-called "Cadillac" insurance plans, items they believe it would be tough for those Democrats in swing districts to vote against. Ryan also emphasized that the standoff over immigration is preventing a longer-term funding deal for the Pentagon. "Funding for modernizing the Army has been cut in half in just the past eight years. Navy sailors are putting in 100-hour work weeks, and less than half of their aircraft are capable of flying. The number of fatal accidents or those resulting in the loss of aircraft for the Marines has doubled over the last decade," Ryan said, adding, "it's baffling to me that Democrats would be willing to block funding for a military over unrelated issues." House Democratic leaders are urging their members to oppose the measure because it fails to address DACA, according to Democratic sources. House Republicans aren't unified But Ryan still had work to do with the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Ohio GOP Rep. Warren Davidson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, told reporters he's undecided on how he'll vote. But he blasted Democrats for their position, saying, "they're picking 800,000 people who brought them here illegally versus our troops and that is very frustrating so we have wanted to have this money to our troops since October 1, meanwhile our troops aren't getting this money." GOP leaders have consistently argued House Democrats would be responsible for a shutdown if the measure fails on the House floor, and Meadows conceded that it would be easier to blame Democrats for a shutdown if the House clears the bill but it fails in the Senate (Democrats are quick to point out that Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the Executive Branch). Pressed what he and other conservatives are asking leaders for, Meadows said they are pressing for more details on the big picture plan going forward. "At what point are we going to have a plan on where we land or are we just going to hope that February 16 is better than January 19 because it's in a different month?" In the Senate In the Senate, it was still unclear exactly how Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would manage to get the votes. McConnell, unlike, Ryan needs Democrats. And many Democrats were keeping their powder dry as to how they would vote, waiting on the House to lay their cards on the table and prove they had the GOP votes on their own to pass the continuing resolution. Senate Democrats are also caught in a tough spot. A handful are running for re-election in states where Trump handily won in 2016. Red state Democrats don't want to run the risk of being labeled as responsible for a shutdown. "I want to keep the government open. I'm just going to work and work and work to keep the government open," West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said. But others are under pressure from their liberal base who mobilized when lawmakers voted for a short-term spending bill last time around. Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, said he had doubts about voting for another short-term CR while Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, remained vague about what his plans were. "I would hope we'd have something everybody has agreed to," Leahy said. "I would hope the President and Republican leaders wouldn't want to humiliate themselves by not going forward with what we agreed to." Others are just tired of the whole exercise: Congress using short-term spending bills to kick the can down the road only to return to do it again a month later. "I'm just tired of voting for CRs," said Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine. This story has updated with additional developments and will continue to update throughout Thursday.

1637\Politics\Washington (CNN)House Republican leaders think they can get the votes for the short-term spending bill, but don't have them yet. Senate Republican leaders think they can pick off enough Democrats to pass a short-term spending bill, but don't have them yet. Democrats, meanwhile, find themselves digging in even further in opposition to not just the lack of resolution for the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but the overall short-term Republican funding strategy. Bottom line: there are less than 48 hours until the government shuts down and, well, any one of a number of potential missteps can collapse this process. And that was before President Donald Trump tweeted that an extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program shouldn't be included in the funding bill, a key sweetener that GOP leaders had hoped would gain enough Democratic votes in the Senate. "CHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension!" Trump tweeted Thursday morning. Despite all the other distractions, there are only two questions that matter: Can House Republicans get the votes they need to pass a funding bill without Democrats? Can Senate Republicans pick off enough Democrats to pass a funding bill? If the answer to those questions is yes, there won't be a government shutdown. If the answer to one or both is no, don't make plans Saturday. That Trump tweet on CHIP Trump's tweet on CHIP threw a wrench into negotiations, though its exact effects weren't immediately clear in the moments after its delivery. A proposal to fund the government until mid-February unveiled by House GOP leaders earlier this week included a six-year reauthorization of CHIP, aimed at winning over key Democratic votes in the Senate (though the extension also had its fans among Republicans in both chambers). Senate GOP leaders will need possibly more than a dozen Democrats to sign on to measure to fund the government based on Senate rules requiring 60 votes to break a filibuster and advance (more on that below). Trump's own administration on Wednesday said it supported the legislation for a continuing resolution that included CHIP funding. Not only was the six-year extension of CHIP meant to win Democratic votes, the program is in need of more certainty. Funding for the program expired at the end of September, and while Congress has cobbled together funding mechanisms to try and keep states covered, the money is hardly the kind of long-lasting solution that many states say they need to keep the program running and provide assurances to low-income families that their children will have health insurance. The program covers roughly 9 million children. The issues in the House House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows and Rep. Jim Jordan met Wednesday night with Rep. Patrick McHenry, the chief deputy whip, to try and figure out a path forward for the restive conservative bloc. While Meadows said things were progressing, it's an open question what leadership is actually willing to give them -- or if they'll even give them anything at all. Among the issues at play: Specific boosts in defense funding, Commitment to a vote, and support, for the conservative DACA proposal introduced last week Important note: Meadows is a very close ally of Trump's and noted he'd been speaking to him Wednesday. The White House very clearly supports the short-term spending bill. Key House indicators House Republicans leaders were whipping the vote throughout the day Wednesday, so they have a good idea of where they stand and what they need. Keep an eye on House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, at his midday news conference -- he's got a pretty good poker face on these things, but if he thinks he's in a good place, it'll be pretty apparent. If House Republicans start scheduling emergency conference meetings, or delay the vote, or start working on any new piece of short-term funding legislation, that's when things are officially going off the rails. Again, senior GOP aides do not expect this to happen. But they also openly acknowledge there's work to be done. House Democrats Democrats are whipping "no" on the bill. This is up to Republicans -- at least until they reach a majority, then expect some Democrats to come over and join them. One note: The current House Republican whip team is very good. It doesn't mean they'll always get the votes (think health care in March), but they are rarely, if ever, off with their count. And in the last few months they've managed to secure GOP majorities on a series of tough to pass bills, including a short-term funding bill in December. The safety valve: House Republicans adopted a rule Wednesday night that allows them to bring any bill to the floor, at any time, through January 20. You don't adopt that rule if you think things are on a glide path. Better to be safe than sorry with the high level of uncertainty across the Capitol right now, multiple aides acknowledged. Over in the Senate, a red flag from inside the room: Senate Democrats, according to multiple sources in the room, reached a new level of anger and frustration during the closed-door lunch Wednesday. It went beyond the lack of DACA resolution, with several senators standing in the meeting to rip how Republicans are handling the short-term spending process in general. The point from several: we have to put a stop to this. Again, threatening to withhold the votes and actually doing it are two different thing, but according to these sources, Wednesday was a day where withholding the votes really seemed possible. Where Democrats really stand Senate Democratic leadership hasn't whipped the short-term funding bill vote yet -- and likely won't until it's clear House Republicans have the votes to pass the measure. Aides say several subgroups of senators have been in contact to try and game out next steps, but nothing has been locked in yet. As we've noted several times, they are in react mode, and given the fickleness of House Republicans, there is little urgency for Democrats to come out with a position until the ballgame is officially in their chamber. Where Senate Republicans stand Top Senate GOP aides expect Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to keep his conference together, but the final number is far from a sure thing. Sen. Lindsey Graham has already said he's opposed. Leadership doesn't expect Sen. John McCain back this week. Sens. Rand Paul and Mike Lee often vote against short-term spending bills. Other Republicans are frustrated in general. So, while McConnell has a 51-49 majority, he's going to need more than just nine Democrats to get him to the 60 vote threshold he needs to pass any spending bill. Aides are predicting he'll need between 12 and 14. That only makes the job more difficult. Key indicators in the Senate There are two smart places to look if you want to see the Democrats who may be in play for McConnell: Those who have tough 2018 races in states won by Trump in 2016, and the 16 who voted "yes" on the short-term spending bill in December. That said, not every red state Democrat feels the same pressure on this and Democratic aides expect at least three, possibly more, of the 10 Trump-state Democrats up for re-election to vote against a short-term spending bill. As to the list of those who supported the short-term bill in December? Two -- New Mexico Sens. Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich -- came out in opposition to a short term funding bill Wednesday. When will it be clear how Democrats will position themselves? Nothing will move until the House moves forward on their bill. But conversations will be happening throughout the day today, aides say. This still isn't fully sketched out, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, knows better than anyone there are members who will have to vote "yes" on what McConnell puts up - and he's given them plenty of space to do just that. The question is what the position -- and Schumer's ask -- will be of the rest of his caucus.

1638\Politics\Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump insisted Thursday that he has remained consistent in his plans for a border wall, a day after his chief of staff, John Kelly, told Fox News he has "changed his attitude" on it. Trump was fuming after Kelly's Fox News interview, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, adding that the President "hated" the comments. "The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it. Parts will be, of necessity, see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water," the President tweeted. "The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. The $20 billion dollar Wall is "peanuts" compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke!" Appearing on Fox News Wednesday evening, Kelly pointed to the border wall as an example of how the President has adjusted his views after being briefed by experts. "He has evolved in the way he's looked at things," Kelly said, adding, "Campaign to governing are two different things, and this President has been very, very flexible in terms of what is within the realm of the possible." He added, "He's changed his attitude towards the DACA issue and even the wall." Asked whether Mexico would pay for the wall, Kelly suggested the payment would be indirect. "We have some ideas on how things like visa fees, renegotiation on NAFTA on what that would mean to our economy. So in one way or another, it's possible that we could get the revenue from Mexico but not directly from their government," he told Fox. Sources also told CNN that Kelly told Democratic lawmakers that some of Trump's positions on the border wall were "uninformed." Trump's tweets Thursday mark the latest example of him contradicting his own administration officials or White House policy. He publicly suggested last fall that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was "wasting his time" trying to negotiate with North Korea, and last week complicated a closely coordinated effort between his administration and congressional Republican leadership on a six-year extension of a section of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. From December 2016 through November 2017, the United States ran a trade deficit of $70.1 billion with Mexico, according to the Commerce Department. That figure represents goods only -- things like cars, oil and food. Including services, the trade deficit with Mexico was $68.3 billion from October 2016 through September 2017, the most recent figures available. This includes things like tickets on US airlines, US banking services and US media services.

1639\Politics\(CNN)Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday that despite months of intense debate over immigration legislation, President Donald Trump has not made clear what he wants in a final bill, one that he would sign into law. "I'm looking for something that President Trump supports. And he's not yet indicated what measure he's willing to sign," McConnell said at a Capitol Hill news conference. "As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I would be convinced that we were not just spinning our wheels going to this issue on the floor, but actually dealing with a bill that has a chance to become law and therefore solve the problem." McConnell's blunt answer came in response to questions about where the immigration debate goes now that a bipartisan Senate proposal from the so-called "gang of six" was rejected by Trump and GOP leaders. In recent days, the President's views on the thorny immigration negotiations have swung widely. A week ago Tuesday, he was animated at a televised meeting on immigration and seemed open to the bipartisan proposal, which would allow a large group of young people affected by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to stay in the US in return for more funding for border security and other immigration reforms. But by Thursday he had changed his tune, siding with conservative immigration hawks and rejecting the proposal during a contentious Oval Office meeting. McConnell's deputy in the Senate leadership is John Cornyn of Texas. He is spearheading fresh talks on the issue with the other second-ranking Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate. Asked whether the White House was being clear about what it wanted, Cornyn noted that the group had met earlier in the day with White House chief of staff John Kelly and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and "had an extensive discussion about the elements they are interested in, particularly in regard to border security and dealing with some of the gaps in our current laws." But Cornyn also said the White House is giving broad latitude for lawmakers to come up with a deal. "The White House is waiting for us to come with an agreement. They are not really dictating it, necessarily," he said. "I think we all have a pretty good idea of what we have to do. We just have to do it." \0.2877320945262909,0.08598151803016663,-0.01295160036534071,-0.3436504006385803,0.6777583360671997,0.10123929381370544,0.7261118292808533,0.5011130571365356,-0.7559646368026733,-0.9955095052719116,0.20861589908599854,1.932456612586975,-0.5741719603538513,-0.5879433155059814,0.18211838603019714,-0.3878675103187561,0.14163975417613983,0.3390306830406189,0.3123636245727539,-0.9210422039031982,0.11797483265399933,0.04559055343270302,0.18910661339759827,-0.43390321731567383,-1.056758165359497,0.5071168541908264,0.2655796408653259,0.5437067151069641,-0.1768830418586731,-0.12350675463676453,-0.33844760060310364,-0.08724111318588257,0.5191826224327087,-0.005831808317452669,0.27657604217529297,-0.39839664101600647,0.18441182374954224,-0.22854503989219666,0.31787410378456116,-0.7071032524108887,-0.353234201669693,-0.14579136669635773,-0.10692498087882996,-0.9089161157608032,-0.2854962646961212,0.2722514271736145,0.4444580376148224,0.21975600719451904,-0.23793251812458038,0.15298520028591156,0.6202625632286072,-0.857692301273346,0.10627681761980057,0.3245418667793274,0.554802417755127,-1.1922706365585327,0.6954850554466248,-0.04074249044060707,-1.1417021751403809,0.6077899932861328,-0.4322390556335449,0.1715482771396637,-1.024256706237793,-0.5587139129638672,-1.0399212837219238,0.24645297229290009,-0.09608631581068039,0.8400431871414185,-0.625167191028595,0.23150098323822021,0.5108059048652649,-0.47205203771591187,-0.65193110704422,-0.6347313523292542,-1.1384048461914062,-0.9194758534431458,0.5327951312065125,0.4536176323890686,-0.9799511432647705,-0.4071500897407532,0.1002974733710289,-0.10675244778394699,-0.9055365324020386,0.1468280404806137,0.358410120010376,0.3329092860221863,-0.21444028615951538,0.16991014778614044,-0.24051421880722046,-0.14049507677555084,0.1261843591928482,0.11038277298212051,-1.2875562906265259,-0.35011014342308044,-0.32295525074005127,0.550389289855957,0.48938342928886414,-0.2147122174501419,0.057896602898836136,0.025521202012896538\CNN\McConnell:  Trump hasn't said what he wants in immigration bill \2018-01-18 00:29:49.0\1521, 1557, 1639, 1659
1640\Politics\Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump contradicted his own administration on Thursday when he tweeted that funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program should not be included in a short-term plan to fund the government. "CHIP should be part of a long-term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension," Trump tweeted. That is the opposite to what his administration said on Wednesday. "The Administration supports the bill's multiyear funding extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)," the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement. "If H.J. Res. 125 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law." Trump's tweet -- which confounded even Trump's aides inside the West Wing -- threw negotiations over how to fund the government into chaos as a Friday deadline looms. Republicans, including those inside the Trump administration, had planned to use funding for children's health care program to woo Democratic votes for the short-term spending bill. Multiple White House officials did not respond when asked whether Trump would veto a bill that included CHIP funding or why the administration's position changed. A proposal to fund the government until mid-February unveiled by House GOP leaders earlier this week included a six-year reauthorization of the children's health insurance program, aimed at winning over key Democratic votes in the Senate. The inclusion of the funding, aides said, was strategic and backed by the White House. Republican aides hope including the popular children's health care program would make it difficult for Democrats, particularly in the Senate, to oppose on both policy and political grounds. And for those that did, that vote would become a potent political issue for Republicans to attack on in the weeks and months ahead. "I feel that it makes no sense for Democrats to try and bring us to a shutdown, to try and cut off CHIP funding for states that are running out of money like Minnesota, and Washington, and Kentucky, and other states," House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday. Senate GOP leaders will need roughly 10 Democrats to sign on to the measure to fund the government based on Senate rules requiring 60 votes to break a filibuster and advance. Thursday is not the first time the President seemed to tweet a position contradicting a top administration official or previously announced White House policy. Trump publicly suggested last fall that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was "wasting his time" trying to negotiate with North Korea, and last week complicated a closely coordinated effort between his administration and congressional Republican leadership on a six-year extension of a section of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. CHIP was first authored by late Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts and Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah. But it garnered significant support from then-first lady Hillary Clinton, who has recently slammed Republicans who failing to reauthorize the program. Despite the delay, though, both Republicans and Democrats have said they support funding the program. "I think everybody across party lines wants to see our military funded. They want to see the CHIP program funded," Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said on CNN a few minutes before Trump's tweet.

1641\Politics\(CNN)It was as unanticipated as it was detailed. On Wednesday in Stanford, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spelled out, in rare and lengthy granular form, exactly what America's endgame in Syria looks like. Over six years into a war that -- after outside powers ensured the near defeat of ISIS, and of the Syrian rebellion itself -- is slowly and bloodily coming to an end, the Trump administration is finding itself doing precisely what its predecessor resisted, and settling in for the longer term. Tillerson was very specific about what needs to happen for the US to stop "remaining engaged" in Syria -- a set of conditions which, if shared as an opinion by the White House and Pentagon, potentially amount to a long presence indeed. Firstly, he said ISIS and al Qaeda must "suffer an enduring defeat." ISIS are massively diminished, but questions remain about where possibly hundreds of stragglers may be -- including the foreign fighters and leaders who fled the final stand in Raqqa. Some are trying to get to Turkey, others are mingled with refugees in the desert. They'll be hard to track and likely will return as a ragtag insurgency. The addition of al Qaeda to this mix raises a point many Western officials have kept out of sight as the ISIS war wound up: there are hundreds of foreign al Qaeda members in northwest Syria's Idlib area. They are currently facing a regime onslaught, but they have no love for the West. Ensuring their "enduring defeat" is a long-term project that hasn't really gotten underway yet. Tillerson's second condition is that the "underlying conflict between the Syrian people and the Assad regime is resolved through a UN-led political process prescribed in UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and a stable, unified, independent Syria, under post-Assad leadership, is functioning as a state." That's a lot. It does appear to stick to the Obama administration's demand that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad leave -- yet it also adds in UNSC resolution 2254, passed in late 2015, which called for elections by the middle of last year. In short, this point possibly ties the US to being in Syria until Assad is gone. Iranian influence Thirdly, according to Tillerson, Iranian influence in Syria must be "diminished". This is no easy task. Iran is a key backer of the Assad regime, and its militias assisted in much of the fighting. The Iranians have deep roots in Lebanon, via the Shia militant group Hezbollah, and they are equally well-served by allied militias in neighboring Iraq. A US military presence in northern Syria can monitor or maybe get in the way of Iran's influence there, particularly on the long route towards Lebanon and its neighbor Israel, but it can't stop it outright. Tillerson's fourth desired outcome is for conditions on the ground to improve to the point where "refugees and IDPs can begin to safely and voluntarily return to Syria." Currently the regime advances around rebel-held Idlib are creating a displacement crisis, rather than reversing it. But if Turkey has its way and offers enough assistance, parts of the north can be made habitable enough for the millions of Syrians in southern Turkey to contemplate going home. Fifth, and finally, Tillerson added that Syria must be "free of weapons of mass destruction." This harks back to the use of Sarin gas in 2013, of which Damascus was accused, which led to Russia persuading the Assad regime to let in inspectors to remove their chemical weapons program. 'Stabilization' One Western official CNN spoke to just after that process was announced as complete said he thought about 99% of the weapons had been collected, and that there was just an issue over the items used in the 2013 Sarin attack itself. If the regime had handed those over, the official said, it would have been an implicit admission of guilt in the original attack. Tillerson's final point was almost added as a kicker, just in case the previous four could be magically resolved overnight. He was clear that the many "stabilization" operations underway with American assistance -- mine-clearing, local governance -- did not amount to "nation building". But he added that a total US military withdrawal "would restore Assad and continue his brutal treatment against his own people", and also create potential "ungoverned spaces" in which ISIS might flourish again, citing the 2011 departure of US forces in Iraq that gave ISIS room to grow there. Read: Syrian army vows to eject US troops It is an extraordinarily detailed, point by point approach from the Trump administration that inserts US forces into a geopolitical minefield they once sought to avoid -- and one that they arguably now risk worsening if they suddenly pull out overnight. And while this wish list is so extensive it may never be fully satisfied, it will perhaps reassure America's allies concerned that four years of Trump would mean four years of US isolationism and withdrawal. \0.7366594672203064,0.42281362414360046,-0.5985968112945557,1.0088523626327515,-0.16787807643413544,0.052480097860097885,1.1956474781036377,-1.0879323482513428,-0.5494672656059265,-0.30486878752708435,0.04874364286661148,1.0371923446655273,0.16021029651165009,0.9139319658279419,-1.1380705833435059,-0.5095465779304504,0.9837514162063599,0.3497055768966675,-0.5814740061759949,0.028843726962804794,0.7228348255157471,-0.8255332708358765,0.22453263401985168,-0.41054004430770874,-0.3649805784225464,0.25108057260513306,1.2618099451065063,0.608858048915863,-1.218002200126648,0.1865808069705963,-1.1495361328125,0.794164776802063,0.547825813293457,0.33585551381111145,0.15119701623916626,-0.3057592213153839,-0.03579169511795044,-0.02911079302430153,0.9201534986495972,-0.04707211256027222,-0.11990880966186523,-1.2372757196426392,0.33000442385673523,-0.08232101798057556,0.2719774842262268,1.2865386009216309,0.19298863410949707,0.1699688732624054,-1.6451114416122437,-0.6103025078773499,1.3107967376708984,-0.6371526122093201,0.40950730443000793,0.8785174489021301,0.7499110102653503,-0.36274445056915283,1.6065372228622437,0.12467598915100098,-2.720006227493286,-0.3511233329772949,1.1439257860183716,0.3279429078102112,-0.4551706612110138,-0.3280099332332611,-1.3605314493179321,0.01544164214283228,0.4969082474708557,1.1762181520462036,-0.05249882489442825,0.9733645915985107,0.9198188781738281,-0.6787670850753784,-1.2642940282821655,0.1786588579416275,-1.5391366481781006,-0.4567274749279022,0.17007488012313843,-0.22731338441371918,-1.4116616249084473,-2.5328009128570557,-0.5752007365226746,-0.09446921944618225,-1.7675877809524536,0.10179761797189713,0.0431918203830719,0.24231423437595367,-0.538797914981842,0.19090309739112854,0.6821919679641724,0.17879292368888855,-1.2023835182189941,0.11230017989873886,-0.045420631766319275,1.17281973361969,0.5500481128692627,-0.3037031292915344,0.2921209931373596,-0.1794523447751999,-1.0220290422439575,1.08711576461792\CNN\Tillerson's Syria wish list means US is in it for the longer haul \2018-01-18 14:21:16.0\1597, 1641
1642\Politics\Washington (CNN)Some Senate Democrats are calling for hearings to evaluate sexual assault and harassment in the workplace, as the #MeToo movement brings the discussion to the national forefront. In a letter sent by Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and signed by all Democrats on the US Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the lawmakers call for the committee "to play a leadership role in tackling the problem of workplace sexual harassment and assault." The committee has oversight jurisdiction over the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is tasked with enforcing federal laws written to prevent discrimination and harassment in the workplace. In the letter, the senators asked for the hearings to evaluate whether the EEOC has adequate resources to address the scale of the problem. "As members of the committee, it is our duty to ensure that workers are protected from sexual assault and harassment in their jobs," the senators wrote. "The deluge of workers who have come forward to report incidents of workplace sexual harassment and assault in recent months has rightly caused Congress to reexamine existing anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policies and has forced us to question the efficacy of existing worker protections." In recent months, Congress has been re-evaluating its system for reporting sexual harassment and assault on the Hill as dozens of lawmakers, staff, interns and political veterans have reported harassment, assault or cite knowledge of others who have been harassed or assaulted. The senators say the problem extends well beyond the Capitol. "A recent report by the EEOC found that 'anywhere from 25% to 85%" of women have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace,'" the letter reads. "Women are more likely to experience sexual harassment than men; meanwhile, low-income women and women of color often face unique barriers to sexual harassment reporting and prevention. But despite the pervasiveness of harassment, the committee has yet to hold a hearing on workplace sexual harassment." In a statement, the committee's top Democrat Patty Murray said: "With more and more women coming forward and sharing stories of sexual assault and harassment in workplaces across the country, it is absolutely our committee's responsibility not only to lift up the voices of these brave survivors, but to do everything we can to make sure that women -- and all workers -- can do their jobs free from sexual assault and all kinds of harassment. I'm glad so many members of our committee agree, and I have made clear to Chairman (Lamar) Alexander that I hope we can schedule committee hearings on these issues as quickly as possible." \0.7298479080200195,-0.09626630693674088,-0.6860408186912537,-0.6174333691596985,1.1691811084747314,0.7946555614471436,1.3171839714050293,-0.0762401595711708,-1.0262478590011597,-0.4825632572174072,0.924446165561676,1.2276606559753418,0.2835371494293213,0.15783534944057465,-0.47174522280693054,0.35694387555122375,0.5847130417823792,0.2389162927865982,-0.2952836751937866,-0.15357983112335205,0.10462550818920135,-0.3075408339500427,0.42308464646339417,-0.07749810814857483,-0.2906377911567688,-0.01937534101307392,0.16725072264671326,-1.0310066938400269,-0.3457208275794983,-0.678710401058197,0.07072586566209793,-0.8793122172355652,-0.6215690970420837,-0.3490762412548065,0.6916335821151733,0.5687811374664307,-0.1338910013437271,-0.4419804513454437,-0.30175304412841797,0.659966230392456,-0.4465410113334656,-0.1988985687494278,0.07725922763347626,-0.46390536427497864,-0.5904206037521362,0.6434928178787231,0.4832328259944916,0.006743178702890873,-0.1795656681060791,-0.24307426810264587,0.3838389813899994,-0.509497344493866,0.9559592008590698,0.2083456963300705,1.202498435974121,-0.20499391853809357,0.7800166010856628,-1.4163554906845093,-0.5800574421882629,0.8794910311698914,-0.4752296209335327,0.43241599202156067,0.1293162852525711,0.13634653389453888,-0.5879325866699219,0.47412100434303284,0.3719125986099243,0.7175068259239197,-0.37956318259239197,0.1486159712076187,0.5573071241378784,0.137040913105011,-0.618576169013977,0.0516759417951107,-1.328719973564148,-0.03354669362306595,0.36130619049072266,0.762558102607727,0.03190796449780464,-0.4170323312282562,0.06957598775625229,0.13431209325790405,-0.6796009540557861,-0.02464502863585949,0.6493349075317383,0.7969613671302795,-0.10414686799049377,0.3188524544239044,0.1648305356502533,0.15714171528816223,-0.7172549366950989,-0.14169670641422272,-1.4090235233306885,0.2187659591436386,-0.8900130391120911,0.8369978666305542,0.16688664257526398,-1.2019761800765991,-1.1982676982879639,-0.44806617498397827\CNN\Senate Democrats call for hearings on workplace sexual misconduct\2018-01-18 12:09:02.0\
1643\Politics\(CNN)Former Senator Bob Dole can no longer walk, but he came to his feet as the National Anthem played during a ceremony in his honor. The 94-year-old World War II vet was presented with the Congressional Gold Medal on Wednesday. The Gold Medal is the highest civilian honor bestowed by Congress. Before the ceremony in which leaders from both parties praised Dole's years of civic and military service, the former Kansas senator and presidential candidate struggled to stand as the colors were presented. After motioning for an aide, Dole managed to stand upright with support as the anthem played. During the ceremony, President Trump praised Dole, calling him a "great American." "In hearing (Dole's) story they will truly learn what it means to be a great American. Bob, that is the legacy that you have left our nation and it will outlive us all. You are a friend, you are a patriot, a hero, a leader and today you have become a recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal," Trump said. \0.5787044167518616,0.4583333432674408,-0.15103958547115326,0.3115772306919098,0.3939211368560791,-0.31390833854675293,0.9430204629898071,-0.2913886308670044,0.34408801794052124,0.08529308438301086,0.4851081669330597,0.8238072991371155,-0.14164569973945618,-0.26279571652412415,-1.01343834400177,-0.15554039180278778,0.33979594707489014,-0.3486754298210144,0.2384794056415558,0.13158784806728363,-0.34867382049560547,-0.8652155995368958,0.721992552280426,-0.44538649916648865,-0.9512246251106262,0.5924661755561829,-0.11393361538648605,0.3174546957015991,-0.5122603178024292,-0.1773557811975479,0.3655868172645569,0.11196652054786682,-0.5493090748786926,0.38278716802597046,-0.10457684099674225,-0.1382577121257782,-0.40270450711250305,0.3214268684387207,-0.10502380132675171,-0.1963825672864914,-0.15897849202156067,-1.0184129476547241,0.2046898454427719,-0.1806797981262207,0.13233982026576996,0.6035981774330139,0.4149427115917206,0.02481425739824772,-0.50667804479599,-0.4687444567680359,0.11881944537162781,-0.35447758436203003,-0.7083557844161987,0.4924660921096802,0.22034938633441925,-0.4059111177921295,0.35303255915641785,0.21880604326725006,-0.5464039444923401,0.6292296648025513,0.044741224497556686,-0.7116266489028931,-0.008554468862712383,-0.3383546769618988,-0.4050913453102112,0.2273166924715042,-0.10470857471227646,0.2698391079902649,-0.32608866691589355,0.6341571807861328,0.8850874900817871,-0.7041443586349487,-0.4477539360523224,0.8576611280441284,-0.5867148041725159,0.20239827036857605,0.15483210980892181,0.9700140357017517,0.3302997350692749,0.06456848233938217,0.5443717837333679,-0.6065208315849304,-0.36541229486465454,-0.7998793125152588,0.19374492764472961,0.12378494441509247,-0.041685301810503006,-0.09007783234119415,-0.5148462057113647,-0.07789208739995956,-0.4081677794456482,0.04873952642083168,-0.41126748919487,-0.2874833941459656,0.7392265200614929,0.01669776812195778,-0.3380374312400818,-0.22211800515651703,-0.346861869096756,-0.41127148270606995\CNN\Bob Dole rise to his feet from wheelchair for National Anthem\2018-01-18 15:54:38.0\
1644\Politics\Washington (CNN)The Department of Homeland Security will stop allowing Haitians to get temporary agricultural and seasonal visas -- a move that comes amid concerns about the Trump administration's feelings toward immigrants of that country and broader restrictions on legal immigration. The announcement, which was published in the Federal Register on Thursday, removes Haiti from a list of countries that are eligible for the visas, called the H-2A agricultural and the H-2B non-agricultural temporary permits. Roughly 80 countries are eligible for the temporary worker programs, and the list is published every year. While it's unusual, countries are removed from the list at times. Haiti is being removed along with Belize and Samoa. The decision to exclude Haiti may raise questions because it comes in the wake of the administration's decision to end Temporary Protected Status for nearly 60,000 Haitians who have been living and working legally in the US since the country's devastating earthquake in 2010. And it comes after President Donald Trump's disparaging remarks last week regarding immigrants of African nations and Haiti became public. In its notice, DHS justifies the decision for each country. Belize is being excluded because it is included by the US on the list of countries that do not meet standards on human trafficking and are not making efforts to do so, the notice said. Samoa was removed because it does not take back its deported nationals from the US, an issue referred to as recalcitrant countries. Haiti's justification, though, cites "extremely high rates of refusal," "high levels of fraud and abuse and a high rate of overstaying" their visas when they end. It did not provide any statistics or further evidence. "Haiti has shown no improvement in these areas, and the Secretary of Homeland Security has determined, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, that Haiti's inclusion on the 2018 H-2A and H-2B lists is no longer in the U.S. interest," the notice says. Haiti does have a high rate of visa overstays, when immigrants continue to live in the US illegally beyond their work authorization, according to the most recent Entry/Exit Overstay Report from DHS. The country's nationals had a suspected overstay rate of just over 39% out of roughly 1,500 immigrants in 2016 in the temporary worker category. Only a few hundred Haitians work specifically under the H-2 category in the US each year. That rate is higher than other countries on the list of acceptable H-2 countries, though others have high rates as well, including Guatemala at over 28%, the Philippines at nearly 29%, Ethiopia at nearly 20% and Papua New Guinea at 20%. Other countries with higher rates were already not on the list. Michael Clemens, a senior fellow who studies the economics of migration at the Center for Global Development, which advocates policies to reduce global poverty, said the H-2 visas were virtually the only legal way for Haitians to work in the US besides Temporary Protected Status, and taking them away could drive illegal migration. Clemens also said that based on his research on the profit for businesses on products and services the Haitian temporary workers produce, he estimates each worker contributes $4,000 to the US economy per month, and $3,000 to the Haitian economy per month. Clemens added that while he has no evidence that Trump's remarks and the visa move are linked, the timing is troubling. "The administration has made it clear that it sees no benefit from Haitian immigrants in the US, and that's incorrect. There has been a tremendous benefit from Haitian migrants to the US, including on this particular visa," Clemens said. "No doubt that it's a pile-on." \0.2672800123691559,-0.02344050630927086,-1.7070386409759521,0.9373521208763123,0.770453691482544,0.22781263291835785,0.9231073260307312,0.556750476360321,0.13944730162620544,-0.015876855701208115,0.9420479536056519,0.30526256561279297,-0.7384029030799866,0.2759450376033783,-0.5751825571060181,-0.23486927151679993,-0.5341471433639526,0.5729737281799316,0.3003428876399994,-0.02677956596016884,0.4985537528991699,0.0349603034555912,0.42831629514694214,0.34465938806533813,-0.23716716468334198,-0.9840124249458313,1.1174652576446533,0.13501229882240295,-0.8301352262496948,-0.07725812494754791,-0.4818224310874939,0.2667245864868164,0.021741565316915512,0.0955832451581955,0.195125013589859,-0.18306951224803925,0.37024012207984924,-2.1407012939453125,-0.994576096534729,-0.7166486382484436,-0.1644538938999176,0.09439216554164886,-0.5403825640678406,0.6014798283576965,-0.788070023059845,0.29780468344688416,0.47613006830215454,0.6749615669250488,-0.5296605229377747,0.1613033562898636,2.058666706085205,0.10367000102996826,0.040798548609018326,0.11195599287748337,0.3627869188785553,0.563088059425354,1.1377910375595093,0.3645003139972687,-0.3880598247051239,0.7735236883163452,-0.7701446413993835,0.11513572186231613,0.5956918597221375,0.5620508790016174,-0.46455374360084534,0.6206839680671692,0.2945573329925537,0.2853791117668152,-0.8660821318626404,0.6173176169395447,-0.5112236142158508,0.03227665647864342,-0.11275256425142288,0.08590825647115707,-0.7944352626800537,-0.6773079037666321,0.6443618535995483,0.013011209666728973,0.01907631754875183,-0.762145459651947,1.1234437227249146,0.5476956963539124,-0.5824841856956482,0.22916747629642487,0.3626527786254883,0.30491968989372253,-0.39195716381073,0.09374700486660004,0.13276603817939758,0.3973202705383301,0.2598814070224762,-0.07094067335128784,-0.8621608018875122,0.42990392446517944,0.3897036612033844,-0.29212090373039246,-0.17334657907485962,-1.7894309759140015,-0.285881906747818,0.7971940636634827\CNN\DHS to block Haitians from temporary visas\2018-01-18 15:49:57.0\
1645\Politics\(CNN)Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen released a blistering statement Wednesday after being criticized over her recollection of the meeting last week where President Donald Trump reportedly called African nations "shithole" countries. In her statement Wednesday, Nielsen said she is "thoroughly disappointed" that attention keeps being given to the meeting, when "we have serious and urgent border and immigration issues to address." "I decline to spend any more of my time responding other than to say the obvious -- I did not and will not lie under oath and say I heard something I didn't," Nielsen said in the statement. During an oversight hearing Tuesday, Nielsen testified that she did not hear that specific word come from the President during the meeting. The White House did not initially deny that Trump had made the remark, but in subsequent days conflicting accounts emerged from participants in the meeting, and Trump tweeted that he had not used that word, but did use "tough" language. "I did not hear that word used, no sir," Nielsen testified at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, when asked if the President had used that word or similar language to disparage African countries in the meeting with lawmakers on immigration policy. "The conversation was very impassioned. I don't dispute that the President was using tough language; others in the room were also using tough language," Nielsen said. Booker slams DHS secretary's 'amnesia' on Trump's reported 'shithole' comment Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Dick Durbin of Illinois grilled Nielsen over her testimony. "The commander in chief in an Oval Office meeting referring to people from African countries and Haitians with the most vile and vulgar language, that language festers. When ignorance and bigotry is allied with power it is a dangerous force in our country. Your silence and your amnesia is complicity," Booker said. Nielsen also noted at one point that Sen. Lindsey Graham had used strong language -- prompting Durbin to speak on Graham's behalf. The South Carolina Republican had not yet arrived at the hearing. "I will just say for the record, Senator Graham spoke up in a way that I respect very much, countering what the President had said about countries in Africa," Durbin said. "Reminding the President that his family did not come to America with great skills or wealth, but they came here as most families do. Looking for a chance to prove themselves and make this a better nation. And in a defense of Senator Graham, his strong words repeated exactly the words used by the President, which you cannot remember."

1646\Politics\Washington (CNN)The Department of Interior is rebutting concerns cited by members of the National Park System Advisory Board who quit on Tuesday. "It is patently false to say the Department had not engaged the board when as recently as January 8 we were working with the board to renew their charter, schedule a meeting, and fill vacancies," a statement issued by the department on Wednesday read. Nine former board members sent a letter Tuesday to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and cited concerns with the Trump administration's priorities regarding the national parks, according to the letter obtained by CNN. The board can have up to 12 members. The author of the letter, former Alaska Democratic Gov. Tony Knowles, said the board is supposed to meet twice a year. However, he said, he's been told things were "suspended." The Interior Department statement said they "welcome" the resignations and accused the departing members of turning a blind eye to reports of "ethics and management failures, all while taking credit for the extensive work of private companies during the NPS centennial celebration." "The Department is happy to report that we have a number of individuals who have expressed interest in joining the board and we will now fast-track filling these new vacancies with people who are actually dedicated to working with the Department to better our national parks. We expect to have a full board meeting soon," the statement said. Former Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes shared his thoughts on the department's statement in a tweet. "Wow. What a mean-spirited, bullshit response from @Interior's politicals. Breathtaking arrogance," Hayes wrote in response to a Washington Post reporter's tweet about the statement. Eight of the nine who were part of the letter had terms expiring in May, and suspected Interior was running out the clock. "For the last year we have stood by waiting for the chance to meet and continue the partnership between the NPSAB and the DOI as prescribed by law," the letter read. "We understand the complexity of transition but our requests to engage have been ignored and the matters on which we wanted to brief the new department team are clearly not part of its agenda." \0.4747083783149719,0.2372482270002365,0.4909782111644745,-0.1174401193857193,0.11526583135128021,-0.3062279522418976,0.5299816131591797,0.3247741758823395,-0.7662076950073242,-0.4912843406200409,0.0930907353758812,0.4724392592906952,-0.6940999627113342,0.8597637414932251,-0.7293800115585327,-0.11570456624031067,0.6820088624954224,-0.13562703132629395,-0.192335307598114,-1.1689764261245728,-0.10606301575899124,-0.10993294417858124,-0.16132362186908722,-0.38603517413139343,-0.11002206057310104,-0.19048920273780823,0.3232118785381317,-0.789175808429718,-0.0014241400640457869,1.098106861114502,0.6451402306556702,0.5281658172607422,-0.03457776457071304,0.11502684652805328,1.076557993888855,0.5968642234802246,0.432564377784729,0.7614182233810425,-0.624573290348053,-0.44708120822906494,-0.49053260684013367,0.47724637389183044,0.1586807370185852,-0.08610191196203232,-0.4725121259689331,0.34846821427345276,0.556780219078064,0.15082453191280365,-0.8521652817726135,0.04732014238834381,-0.5253491997718811,-0.1357467919588089,-0.3974052965641022,-0.5408468842506409,0.4498480558395386,0.09033660590648651,0.11220291256904602,0.41144806146621704,-0.1509777158498764,0.6381730437278748,0.5889098644256592,0.34197455644607544,0.4997981786727905,0.06543171405792236,-0.32739701867103577,0.5760331749916077,0.44246143102645874,0.44507133960723877,-0.40058037638664246,0.7875850796699524,0.5320342183113098,0.3438742458820343,-0.22358156740665436,-0.2990688979625702,-0.6425642371177673,-0.6168191432952881,1.1921182870864868,1.127426266670227,-0.3380187451839447,-0.6907393336296082,1.2474265098571777,0.3295360803604126,-0.2113696038722992,-0.10510463267564774,0.24694408476352692,1.1681180000305176,0.26487472653388977,1.0023821592330933,-0.6387223601341248,0.27221593260765076,-0.5789113640785217,0.1305304765701294,-1.3199408054351807,-0.2652563452720642,-0.63377845287323,1.161728024482727,0.33757483959198,-0.04982181265950203,-1.3613653182983398,0.5276570320129395\CNN\Interior Department rebuts claims in National Park System board members' resignation letter \2018-01-18 03:16:50.0\
1647\Politics\Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump, after years of slamming former President Barack Obama for golfing, comes to the end of a year in office having spent close to 100 days at a golf club that bears his name. The President's favorite haunts are International Golf Club in Palm Beach County, Florida, Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, and Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey -- spending 95 days in his first year as President at one of his signature golf clubs. In total, Trump has also spent 120 days while in office -- nearly one-third of the time -- at a property he owns, including Trump Tower in New York and his hotel blocks from the White House. All presidents take vacations and almost all over the last century golfed during their time in office. What makes Trump unique, however, is the fact that as a private citizen he regularly slammed Obama for hitting the links while president. "Can you believe that, with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf," Trump tweeted in 2014. "Worse than Carter."  Trump also used golf as a way to attack Obama during his 2016 campaign. "I'm going to be working for you. I'm not going to have time to go play golf," Trump said in August 2016 on the campaign trail. To date, though, Trump is on track to surpass Obama's golf total. According to CBS News' Mark Knoller, who covered Obama and tracked his golf habits, the 44th president played 333 rounds of golf as president. It's not golf - it's work? Though it isn't clear how many rounds Trump has played -- his staff rarely confirms whether the commander in chief is golfing and some have gone to great lengths to obscure the President's golf game -- it is possible Trump could surpass that total in his first term as President. Trump also criticized Obama for not using the golf course as a way to build relationships with lawmakers in Washington, including Republicans. "I don't mind that @BarackObama plays a lot of golf," Trump tweeted in 2012. "I just wish he used it productively to make deals with Congress!" Though Trump has used his golf game to foster relationships with other lawmakers, the majority of his outings have been more personal the professional. Of the 95 times Trump has visited a golf course that bears his name, he has golfed at least 7 times with a member of the United States Senate: twice with Sen. Rand Paul, thrice with Sen. Lindsey Graham, once with Sen. Bob Corker and once with Sen. David Perdue. All are Republicans. It doesn't appear that Trump golfed with a Democratic lawmaker during his first year in office. The White House has declined to provide reporters with a readout of people Trump has golfed with. It is also unclear how much Trump's frequent visits to the golf courses cost, especially visits to Mar-a-Lago and Trump International Golf Club in Florida. A group of Democratic senators asked the Government Accountability Office to review security and site-related travel expenses to Trump's visits earlier this year. The organization, according to spokesman Charles Young, plans to release that information this spring. Favorite spots Trump is again expected to travel this weekend to Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he regularly visits his nearby golf club. Trump has spent 49 days as President at his private Florida club, where friends and advisers say the businessman-turned-politician feels most comfortable and at home. When the weather in South Florida turned hot and muggy over the summer, Trump ventured north to the familiar confines of his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump spent a total of 40 days at the club, including a number of work-filled days in August when he held meetings with cabinet officials and called world leaders. Closer to the White House, Trump has visited Trump National Golf Club in Northern Virginia 23 times and has made frequent trips to Trump International Hotel, his recently opened property just blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. Critics have slammed Trump's frequent visits to his properties, arguing they allow the businessman to boost the bottom line at The Trump Organization and give his properties a presidential stamp of approval. Though Trump transferred his businesses holdings to a trust run by his sons before taking office in 2017, he stopped short of selling off his holdings and still could benefit from money flowing into his properties. "The President's incessant exploitation of his office to promote his properties is unprecedented in American history," said Norm Eisen, the chair of the left-leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and a CNN contributor. CREW and other organizations have sued Trump on a host of issues pertaining to his visits to properties that bear his name. \0.0027270845603197813,0.21364206075668335,-0.9544764161109924,1.1573532819747925,0.6661146879196167,-1.487316370010376,1.278127908706665,1.2760655879974365,-2.3217175006866455,0.03042491339147091,0.12241267412900925,-0.7005116939544678,-0.8699162602424622,0.5617852807044983,-0.09927678853273392,0.4792391359806061,-0.373497873544693,0.3067198097705841,0.7260689735412598,-2.3176522254943848,0.7438563108444214,-0.007919365540146828,0.6940793991088867,-1.1950925588607788,-1.9862990379333496,1.9666773080825806,0.9686807990074158,1.3484609127044678,-0.6511228680610657,-0.8624605536460876,1.2322686910629272,1.0258548259735107,-0.21471256017684937,-0.8173142671585083,-0.5702787041664124,-0.5731570720672607,0.0823129341006279,-0.09660802781581879,-0.10830040276050568,-1.3805229663848877,0.6881377696990967,0.887700080871582,1.7801803350448608,-1.0603262186050415,-0.05620413273572922,-0.7772374749183655,0.8345638513565063,1.0777620077133179,-2.1385083198547363,-0.24767780303955078,0.381479948759079,-0.895300567150116,-0.5938462018966675,-0.20145352184772491,1.1083767414093018,-0.24154715240001678,0.9605933427810669,0.026271438226103783,-1.5355585813522339,2.4678022861480713,0.3839157819747925,-1.1719591617584229,-0.8921213150024414,-0.18600425124168396,-0.7053785920143127,0.3659765422344208,0.07809682935476303,-0.1075507402420044,-0.5683042407035828,0.9704792499542236,0.06274611502885818,-1.2504161596298218,-0.9187631011009216,1.448318362236023,-1.946964979171753,-0.43592366576194763,1.4946500062942505,-0.9411529302597046,0.13623476028442383,-0.6508004665374756,0.3524310886859894,-0.5044509768486023,-2.0941109657287598,-0.15355812013149261,1.1546716690063477,-0.5816943049430847,0.37589365243911743,0.49240612983703613,1.3135180473327637,0.4827548861503601,-0.8135793805122375,-1.4087588787078857,-2.524624824523926,0.6356776356697083,-0.1721983253955841,0.802486002445221,-1.3342761993408203,-0.28195586800575256,0.18387006223201752,-2.168268918991089\CNN\Trump hasn't let the presidency get in the way of his golf game\2018-01-18 12:28:18.0\
1648\Politics\Washington (CNN)A year since they last met, President Donald Trump and his predecessor Barack Obama haven't spoken, the first time in decades two successive presidents have avoided communicating in the 12 months after handing off power. Ties between presidents -- if not always friendly -- are usually at least existent. That Trump and Obama have avoided each other speaks to the unprecedented nature of the current White House, and the lingering animosity between two men who openly sparred during 2016's presidential campaign. Trump hasn't shied away from blasting decisions Obama made during his tenure, and has steadily chipped away at key pieces of Obama's legacy like the Paris climate accord and the Affordable Care Act. He's also launched personal attacks, falsely claiming that Obama ordered the phones tapped at Trump Tower or that Obama failed to call family members of slain US servicemen. Obama, meanwhile, has reserved his criticism of Trump for policy matters. On the rare occasions he's spoken publicly over the past year, he's made only veiled references to the current Oval Office occupant. The last time they spoke, Trump and Obama were standing on the East Front of the US Capitol as an idling military helicopter stood nearby. Moments after Trump was inaugurated, Obama appeared loose and smiling, his post-presidency life about to begin. Behind at the White House, tucked into a drawer in the Oval Office, was the traditional note left by a president to his successor. "Congratulations on a remarkable run," Obama wrote. "Millions have placed their hopes in you, and all of us, regardless of party, should hope for expanded prosperity and security during your tenure." Trump was touched by the note, and tried to arrange a phone call with Obama, people familiar with the situation have said. But Obama was flying cross-country to Palm Springs and Trump couldn't get through. When one of Obama's aides reached back out to the White House to return the call, the new President's staffers said Trump just wanted to say thank you for the note -- and wanted Obama to get the message. The men never connected directly. Since then, there have been no conversations or meetings between the two men -- breaking a long line of first-year chats or sit-downs between incoming and outgoing presidents. Usually presidents rely on their predecessors for advice and counsel, even if their relationships are fraught with political differences or lingering electoral animosity. Sometimes they rely on them to carry out diplomatic functions in their stead. Obama spoke on the phone with George W. Bush on February 27, 2009, to discuss his decision to withdraw some troops from Iraq. Bush encountered Bill Clinton on June 1, 2001, at a funeral in Boston. Clinton spoke with George H.W. Bush on September 15, 1993, at a White House ceremony for NAFTA. Bush Sr. spoke with Ronald Reagan -- under whom he served as vice president -- on April 26, 1989, during a meeting in Los Angeles. Reagan spoke with Jimmy Carter on October 8, 1981, at the White House to discuss attending the funeral of slain Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat. Carter spoke with Gerald Ford on September 7, 1977, during a meeting at the White House. Ford spoke with Richard Nixon on November 1, 1974, at a hospital in Long Beach, California. And Nixon spoke with Lyndon B. Johnson at least twice before June 19, 1969, when Nixon said as much during a news conference. \-0.10499128699302673,0.4343200623989105,-0.2205268293619156,0.3122507929801941,0.9430264830589294,0.489950954914093,1.431207537651062,0.18828164041042328,-1.4612246751785278,-0.9704216122627258,-0.09605202823877335,0.01817527785897255,0.10526806116104126,0.5214093327522278,0.26497578620910645,0.24791733920574188,-0.27408021688461304,1.3597458600997925,-1.4384655952453613,-0.26414188742637634,0.08061563223600388,0.40677517652511597,-0.48910772800445557,-0.26380306482315063,-1.6898938417434692,0.7720308303833008,1.3346257209777832,0.5507077574729919,-1.3781558275222778,-0.6822081804275513,0.17821793258190155,0.5812318325042725,0.7953153848648071,0.018320713192224503,1.1038295030593872,0.7202878594398499,0.49140405654907227,-0.28027188777923584,-0.7432517409324646,-1.2512109279632568,0.2407645881175995,-0.06836209446191788,0.7586556673049927,0.9029757976531982,-0.9027445316314697,-0.34397101402282715,0.9269217252731323,1.6819908618927002,-1.836558222770691,0.48804745078086853,-0.3084424138069153,-0.417250394821167,-0.610207200050354,-1.017032504081726,1.0905427932739258,-0.07790736854076385,0.6662409901618958,-0.5962660312652588,-0.7080930471420288,0.2644817531108856,-0.07528591901063919,-1.4069207827560604E-4,0.6509702205657959,0.8394573926925659,-1.1184897422790527,0.9831099510192871,0.9133898615837097,0.09682247042655945,-1.503832459449768,1.1612486839294434,0.6938067078590393,-0.17252029478549957,-1.8554080724716187,0.0808364674448967,-0.7070370316505432,-0.27607864141464233,0.5839415192604065,-0.1314595490694046,-0.16495977342128754,0.12067516148090363,0.6970487833023071,0.08778442442417145,-1.4703389406204224,0.11196084320545197,0.9277839660644531,-0.1727854311466217,1.1603938341140747,0.9175771474838257,0.38119181990623474,-0.21541623771190643,-0.6605814695358276,-0.3186168372631073,-0.8467531204223633,0.10057412087917328,-0.3512461483478546,0.0843629464507103,-0.9704028964042664,-0.5718837976455688,-0.7535433173179626,0.029184885323047638\CNN\Obama welcomed Trump to Washington a year ago.

1649\Politics\Washington (CNN)Fresh off a White House doctor declaring his health excellent, President Donald Trump swiped at his predecessors on North Korea, while saying he "scored the highest on tests." Discussing the issue of North Korea's nuclear ambitions in an interview Wednesday with Reuters, Trump took a swing at his predecessors, former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, for their approaches to the rogue nation. "I guess they all realized they're going to have to leave it to a president that scored the highest on tests. What can I tell you?" Trump said. White House physician Ronny Jackson told reporters on Tuesday that he had screened Trump for neurological impairments at the President's asking during a yearly medical exam last week, and that Trump had scored 30 out of 30 on the cognitive test. Jackson said he "found no reason whatsoever to think the President has any issues whatsoever with his thought processes." Jackson declined during his question and answer session to compare Trump's health to that of other presidents, and he described Trump as in good health outside of needing to lose weight and to exercise. Trump said in the Reuters interview that he already gets exercise. "I mean I walk, I this, I that," Trump said. "I run over to a building next door. I get more exercise than people think." CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta said Jackson's information indicated that the President, like most men of his age, has a common form of heart disease. Trump has bragged in the past about his health and energy as well as his IQ score, which he said in 2013 is "one of the highest." Since becoming President, Trump has continued making similar claims, offering that he could score higher on an IQ test than Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and claiming earlier this month that he is a "genius." \0.238584503531456,-0.5570270419120789,-0.6925411224365234,1.0250059366226196,0.8716556429862976,0.608501136302948,0.9326888918876648,0.7161329984664917,-1.3440152406692505,-0.833965539932251,0.7198660373687744,0.8697171807289124,-0.0193115696310997,-0.4380946457386017,0.005544648505747318,-0.29555508494377136,-0.3989211320877075,0.5537064075469971,0.4064967930316925,-0.9124830961227417,0.06532224267721176,-0.5044114589691162,0.1755535751581192,-0.7154138684272766,-0.8071693778038025,0.26141810417175293,0.9889667630195618,0.5729997754096985,-0.12495964020490646,-0.7368795275688171,-0.13162431120872498,0.25393903255462646,0.5780465006828308,0.27965742349624634,-0.2896864712238312,0.5628954768180847,0.29288947582244873,-0.4516988694667816,0.5720070600509644,-0.34007084369659424,0.09389082342386246,-0.414501816034317,0.5476804971694946,-0.7220620512962341,-0.1523629128932953,-0.2171359807252884,0.14856426417827606,0.28202906250953674,-0.826586127281189,-0.24183128774166107,0.011884265579283237,-0.6451950073242188,-0.5245417952537537,-0.283537894487381,0.8672780990600586,-0.3602527379989624,0.48006582260131836,0.31825438141822815,-0.7375409007072449,1.47331702709198,-0.4185442626476288,-1.1550371646881104,-1.0843464136123657,-0.2897791564464569,-0.8291563391685486,0.5049501061439514,0.19791391491889954,-0.7036915421485901,-0.6056093573570251,0.6507336497306824,-0.6496593356132507,-0.36133575439453125,-0.26669955253601074,0.7309436798095703,-1.1888986825942993,-0.2142389565706253,0.49001479148864746,-0.19479353725910187,-0.7732293605804443,-0.1651415228843689,0.0761629268527031,0.747499406337738,-1.1498442888259888,-0.04937420040369034,-0.12129593640565872,-0.73786461353302,0.2646540701389313,0.11330355703830719,0.24198780953884125,-0.11597411334514618,-0.03960423544049263,-0.2038467675447464,-0.5797216892242432,0.10526658594608307,0.149213507771492,-0.2353101670742035,-0.24216578900814056,-0.14155930280685425,-0.912104070186615,-0.03705750033259392\CNN\Trump: Predecessors left North Korea to a president 'that scored the highest on tests'\2018-01-18 14:49:33.0\
1650\Politics\Washington (CNN)Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon refused to tell the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday about his time at the White House, with the exception of one major "slip-up," the website Axios reported. The Axios report, based on four sources with direct knowledge of the Tuesday interview, said Bannon told congressional investigators he had spoken with other senior White House staffers about a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting that Donald Trump Jr., then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner had with a Russian lawyer offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. Axios characterized the moment as a "slip-up" that stood out from the rest of Bannon's testimony, because he otherwise had declined to answer questions related to his time at the White House and during the transition. Bannon's Hill appearance reveals White House effort to restrict testimony The report said Bannon's lawyer Bill Burck said at the start of the session that Bannon would decline to speak about his time at the White House or during the transition but that Bannon made his remark about the Trump Tower discussion within the first 90 minutes of a hearing that ran more than 10 hours. GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California used Bannon's "slip-up" to try to press him into answering other questions about his time at the White House, the report said. GOP Rep. Mike Conaway of Texas, who is leading the committee's Russia investigation, said Tuesday that the committee issued a subpoena to Bannon, and Schiff accused the White House of preventing Bannon from speaking. News broke during the House Intelligence Committee interview that special counsel Robert Mueller had earlier subpoenaed Bannon to speak before a grand jury, and on Wednesday, CNN reported Bannon had reached an agreement to speak with Mueller's team instead of a grand jury. \-0.054482996463775635,-0.0711035430431366,0.17571744322776794,-0.37625283002853394,0.2853808104991913,0.45727208256721497,0.6293507814407349,0.783428430557251,-1.1438900232315063,-0.8997469544410706,0.3901636302471161,0.3143712878227234,-1.1884286403656006,0.26752424240112305,-0.1831563115119934,-0.5124016404151917,0.4131131172180176,0.1474417895078659,-0.09955616295337677,-1.5199460983276367,0.07749300450086594,-0.08558530360460281,-0.22988392412662506,-0.5992879867553711,-1.0933268070220947,-0.3983253538608551,0.6047831773757935,0.5561967492103577,-0.04893786460161209,0.20236288011074066,0.39463600516319275,0.2701166272163391,0.323346346616745,0.11388858407735825,0.6914321184158325,0.6558679342269897,0.28806155920028687,-0.5806078314781189,-0.29768481850624084,0.07736743241548538,-0.014960751868784428,-0.7660251259803772,0.6315449476242065,-0.7641322612762451,0.6503787040710449,0.20870713889598846,0.4971081614494324,0.1787136197090149,-0.3251645565032959,-0.33607810735702515,0.20178507268428802,-0.6055390238761902,-0.17154698073863983,-0.22059935331344604,1.5453262329101562,-0.389074444770813,0.4768728017807007,-0.5341585874557495,-0.7844187021255493,1.3685548305511475,0.40960124135017395,0.09201246500015259,0.05182085931301117,0.2122856229543686,-0.7193015813827515,0.21837960183620453,0.30704668164253235,1.0675420761108398,-0.43223246932029724,-0.3785988688468933,1.8312371969223022,-0.3524335026741028,-0.9310352802276611,0.4307684004306793,-0.6436225771903992,-0.46374887228012085,0.45817139744758606,0.3693014979362488,-0.3767790198326111,0.1774236410856247,0.11420655250549316,-0.16654406487941742,-0.7064655423164368,-0.39603301882743835,1.3278905153274536,-0.016756586730480194,0.12377724051475525,0.0593688040971756,0.4497204124927521,-0.6314967274665833,1.0001226663589478,0.8545503616333008,-1.0974996089935303,-0.8697858452796936,-0.38569891452789307,0.40239855647087097,-1.0471864938735962,-1.2299845218658447,-0.8015257716178894,0.7531000971794128\CNN\Axios: Bannon had a 'slip-up' in House Intelligence answer\2018-01-18 02:27:30.0\1516, 1561, 1760, 1650, 1652, 1774
1651\Politics\Washington (CNN)A bipartisan group of senators on Wednesday formally unveiled their immigration proposal with new supporters -- even as the White House continued to call the deal dead on arrival. Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, introduced their bill Wednesday afternoon with Sens. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, Michael Bennet, D-Colorado, Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, Cory Gardner, R-Colorado, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, putting the bill close to having enough votes to pass the Senate, assuming unanimous Democratic support, but not quite to the 60-vote threshold needed to advance legislation. The bill appeared to be the same that was presented to President Donald Trump last week, when the President, using vulgar terms, rejected the pitch, according to sources familiar with that meeting. If passed, the bill would appropriate $2.705 billion in border security improvements, eliminate the visa lottery, make permanent the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program -- offering a pathway to citizenship to those who qualify -- and limit "chain migration," or family-based migration, of the individuals eligible for the program. "We'd be crazy to want them to leave. If you met any of these Dream Act kids, the last thing you'd want is for them to leave," Graham said on the Senate floor Wednesday evening. "At the end of the day there's a deal to be had; it just needs to be done. The reason this bipartisan group that I'm part of came about is because no one was doing much of anything." But the President himself and his top advisers continued to tell reporters on Wednesday that the bill was not what the White House was looking for, virtually assuring the measure had no chance of moving forward as it is. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday reiterated that without an affirmative endorsement from Trump, a bill would not move for a vote. "Well, at the risk of being repetitious, I'm looking for something that President Trump supports," McConnell told reporters. "And he's not yet indicated what measure he's willing to sign. As soon as we figure out what he is for, then I would be convinced that we were not just spinning our wheels going to this issue on the floor, but actually dealing with a bill that has a chance to become law and therefore solve the problem." White House chief of staff John Kelly said Wednesday that the bill didn't meet the bipartisan and bicameral standard set by the President. "His sense was, two things. It fell short of certainly what he was looking for based on the Thursday conversation and other conversations," Kelly said. "But more to the point, it did not include all of the senators that have been involved in all of the discussions about DACA and certainly did not involve the House." Sens. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, and James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, said in a joint statement Wednesday evening they would oppose the bill because it "falls short" on border security reforms. "Unfortunately, the 'Gang of Six' proposal falls short since it fails to include even basic border security reforms," they said in a joint statement. "Threatening a government shutdown or demanding a vote on a bill that is doomed to fail is counterproductive. It is also unfair to give false hope to the many DACA recipients waiting on Congress to finally enact legislation." Conservative hard-liners Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley and Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, and David Perdue, R-Georgia, also slammed the bill in a joint statement. They were previously negotiating with the group, but were left out of meetings over disagreements. "The Durbin-Graham-Flake proposal would do nothing to solve the underlying problem in our current immigration system," they said in a statement. "It does not take the needed steps to fix our porous border and it fails to empower law enforcement to apprehend and remove dangerous criminals who are here illegally." The President said in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday that the bill fell short. "It's the opposite of what I campaigned for," Trump said. And White House legislative director Marc Short, coming out of lengthy meetings with lawmakers on different sides of the issue, said the President was still looking for a deal that covered only existing DACA recipients, not a broader population, and a curtailing of family-based migration that goes beyond only those affected by a DACA measure -- two elements inconsistent with the Durbin bill.

1652\Politics\Washington (CNN)The White House is working behind the scenes to limit the testimony to congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, according to multiple sources. The attempts to curtail testimony to congressional investigators became clear this week when former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon appeared before the House Intelligence Committee and infuriated both sides of the aisle by refusing to answer questions about his work during the presidential transition and in the White House. At some points during Bannon's six hours of closed-door testimony, his attorney took breaks to confer via telephone with the White House counsel's office to clarify what questions could be answered and came back with the same guidance: Bannon could not discuss any activities related to the transition or his tenure in the White House. "All shots were called by the White House," says one source familiar with the proceedings. Publicly, White House officials and President Donald Trump's personal lawyers have touted the administration's willingness to cooperate with the ongoing probes. "We've been fully cooperative with the ongoing investigations, and we're going to continue to do so," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters in Wednesday's press briefing. "We encourage the committees to work with us to find the appropriate accommodation in order to ensure Congress obtains all the information that they're looking for." But when it comes to the congressional investigations, the White House counsel's office is instructing some witnesses to limit their testimony, testing the extent of executive privilege by refusing to discuss any activity that occurred after the 2016 election. The White House claims that while Congress is entitled to ask any question it wants, privilege can be waived only by the President. They argue that, in this case, the transition is covered by privilege, while the campaign is not. Democrats see it as an effort to muzzle important witnesses. "This was effectively a gag order by the White House preventing this witness from answering almost any question concerning his time in the transition or the administration. And then any questions even after he left the administration," said California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee. Bannon's team negotiated ground rules with the White House counsel's office the week prior to his appearance before the House Intelligence Committee, according to a source familiar with the situation. The President's personal legal team was aware of discussions between the White House counsel's office and Bannon's lawyer about protecting a possible privilege claim. But it wasn't their decision, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The protection of the privilege is a matter for the White House, not the President's legal team, because it relates to the office. Before the hearing, Bannon's lawyer informed a staff member of Rep. Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, that Bannon planned to claim executive privilege on topics beyond the presidential campaign, a source said. But that information was apparently tightly held. "It caught me personally by surprise" that Bannon asserted executive privilege, said Rep. Mike Conaway, the Texas Republican leading the committee's Russia investigation. South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy and Florida Rep. Tom Rooney, the other two Republicans leading the Russia probe along with Conaway, also said they weren't aware of any agreement between the White House and committee staff about the scope of Bannon's testimony. Gowdy added that, if there were an agreement, he didn't think the staff would have told him anyway because he wouldn't have abided by it. "They wouldn't do that because I'd ask what I think is relevant to ask, and if you've got a legal privilege you can assert it," Gowdy said, adding that Bannon was in a "legally indefensible position." As it became clear on Tuesday that Bannon was refusing to answer questions, the committee served him with a subpoena to compel him to divulge additional information. The President's personal lawyers were not consulted on the specific questions that prompted calls to the White House, a source said. On Wednesday, the White House insisted such coordination between the White House counsel's office and congressional witnesses isn't unusual in a case like this. "That's the same process that is typically followed," Sanders said. "Sometimes, they actually have a White House attorney present in the room. This time, it was something that was relayed via phone and, again, was following standard procedure for an instance like this, and something that will likely happen again on any other number of occasions, not just within this administration, but future administrations." But the scope of what Bannon was claiming was privileged shocked members from both parties. "His version of executive privilege is it covers the transition, the time he was at the White House and covers time forever," Gowdy told Fox News Wednesday. "That is no one's definition of executive privilege." "I certainly have never heard of an example where executive privilege is claimed for a president-elect, I have never heard of privilege being claimed for conversations between two people that don't include the president, which were precluded from being asked about today," Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat and a member of the committee, told CNN's Anderson Cooper Tuesday. Lawmakers were also offended that Bannon had already divulged details about some of his post-campaign activities in Michael Wolff's explosive book "Fire and Fury," but then refused to discuss those events with the committee. Bannon's attorney also informed members that he would, in fact, answer those questions when he meets with special counsel Robert Mueller's team because executive privilege doesn't apply to Mueller's investigation. Sanders declined to say Wednesday whether the White House has actually invoked executive privilege yet or is simply protecting its right to do so in the future. "I can tell you that this White House is following the same practice that many White Houses before us have, that have gone back decades, that there is a process that you go through: Anytime you have congressional inquiries touching upon the White House, the Congress should consult with the White House prior to obtaining confidential material," Sanders said. "This is part of a judicial-recognized process." When Attorney General Jeff Sessions appeared before the House Intelligence Committee, in order to preserve the right for Trump to invoke privilege, he refused to answer questions about whether Trump instructed him to hinder the Russia investigation. National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats both refused in a public Senate Intelligence Committee hearing to discuss private conversations with Trump and whether he tried to interfere with the FBI investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. In December, Donald Trump Jr. refused to tell House investigators what he discussed with his father after reports surfaced about the June 2016 meeting Trump Jr. held with Russians in Trump Tower. In this instance, Trump's son cited attorney-client privilege because attorneys were present during the conversation with his father, pushing the issue even further into far murkier legal territory. Democrats charge that Bannon's appearance before the House committee marks the broadest attempt so far at using privilege to shield events that occurred from the moment Trump was elected. So far lawmakers have taken only limited steps to challenge witnesses about whether their claims of privilege are legitimate. Republicans haven't ruled out the possibility of holding Bannon in contempt, but at least one GOP member -- Gowdy -- suggested it was unlikely. House Speaker Paul Ryan downplayed the issue of whether witnesses like Bannon might be abusing the bounds of executive privilege. "There has always been a tension on executive privilege between the legislative branch and the executive branch. This goes back to every administration," Ryan said. "Obama exercised executive privilege, Bush did, Clinton did. That is a typical tension that you are going to have between the two branches of government." Still, Bannon's stonewalling sparked a sharp warning from Conaway -- the Republican leading the House Russia probe -- to White House aides who might follow the Bannon model: "We're going to insist on getting questions we need to answer our report." Bannon could appear before the House committee again on Thursday and "we fully anticipate" he will answer questions, Conaway said. For its part, the White House offered a dismissive response to the ongoing Russia probes. "I think we've been dealing with this hoax for the better part of a year," Sanders said Wednesday. "If we have to endure the ridiculousness for another month, we can certainly handle it." \0.742928147315979,0.28795379400253296,0.7161162495613098,-0.8296299576759338,0.8775267601013184,-0.4820626974105835,1.2394500970840454,1.2206064462661743,-0.9259446859359741,0.4939499497413635,1.0915734767913818,0.5447213649749756,-2.293665647506714,0.5745863914489746,-0.41706031560897827,0.7949076890945435,0.9776026606559753,0.6653510928153992,-1.2194856405258179,-1.9382119178771973,0.7276673913002014,-0.5766572952270508,0.7159894108772278,-0.26315826177597046,-2.0722367763519287,2.0183727741241455,1.6540138721466064,-0.3688093423843384,-1.3878602981567383,-0.7577136158943176,0.6412383913993835,0.6365004777908325,0.02358679659664631,-0.6067065000534058,1.4122153520584106,1.3888648748397827,-0.503727912902832,-0.15902428328990936,-0.5658636093139648,-1.181365966796875,0.13134191930294037,-1.5027936697006226,0.5605407357215881,-0.07216351479291916,-0.45464205741882324,0.6286144256591797,-0.0014058538945391774,-0.09868884086608887,-2.273568868637085,0.880712628364563,0.4389135241508484,-0.10743801295757294,0.8882946968078613,-0.5781360864639282,1.2662746906280518,-1.512487769126892,2.216658353805542,-0.3005349934101105,-1.793667197227478,2.15364146232605,-1.590169906616211,0.9759759902954102,-0.8791496157646179,1.7180713415145874,-1.103931188583374,-0.2763898968696594,1.0995358228683472,2.3561713695526123,-1.8069124221801758,1.8639618158340454,1.7898286581039429,-0.01731603965163231,-0.8765039443969727,2.0301151275634766,-0.427623450756073,0.5679333209991455,-0.03240572661161423,0.1020279973745346,-0.7913032174110413,-0.9775341153144836,-0.033554695546627045,-1.6662719249725342,-1.959454894065857,-0.5033289790153503,0.7059906721115112,1.5331472158432007,0.36946961283683777,-0.4823358356952667,0.488605797290802,-0.37406960129737854,0.14335905015468597,0.2829040288925171,-2.802001953125,-0.9421558380126953,-0.4935544431209564,-0.8739337921142578,-1.3109325170516968,-1.5268877744674683,-1.887406826019287,-0.5406137704849243\CNN\Bannon's Hill appearance reveals White House effort to restrict testimony\2018-01-18 09:55:28.0\1516, 1561, 1760, 1650, 1652, 1774
1653\Politics\(CNN)White House chief of staff John Kelly told Democratic lawmakers Wednesday that some of President Donald Trump's positions as a candidate on the border wall were "uninformed," sources told CNN. Rep. Ruben Gallego confirmed the comment to CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room." "Yes, we heard him say that," the Arizona Democrat said. A source familiar with Kelly's comments in the closed-door meeting with Democrats and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus told CNN that Kelly said he has worked to educate the President and move him away from his campaign promises. Another source in the room with access to notes from the meeting told CNN that Kelly was talking about the difference between campaign speech and actual policy, saying, "You make campaign promises but then you learn the reality of governing, which is difficult." The wall comments, Kelly said, were just "not fully informed" during the campaign. The "uninformed" comment was first reported by The Washington Post. No new proposal from White House Lawmakers described the meeting as "positive" but also mostly a "rehash" of where both sides stand on stalled immigration talks. The packed meeting with Kelly, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer and key Hispanic Democrats lasted an hour, and was "cordial," according to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat. Kelly did not bring a new proposal from the White House on immigration, Rep. Luis Guiterrez, D-Illinois, said, calling it "unfortunate." Democrats have been pushing for a solution for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which protected young undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children and which President Donald Trump is ending, before they vote for government funding. Last week, Trump rejected a bipartisan proposal from senators that would have done so, in a meeting where he used vulgar language to refer to certain countries. The infamous "shithole countries" remark didn't come up in Wednesday's meeting, lawmakers said, as the conversation focused on the narrow DACA fix Democrats would like to see and the White House's priorities for a deal. "He called the meeting to listen, is how he framed it," Rep. Pete Aguilar of California said of Kelly. Hispanic Caucus members said they were surprised Kelly said he was unfamiliar with a bipartisan bill Aguilar worked on with Texas Republican Rep. Will Hurd, and Aguilar said White House legislative director Marc Short, who was also in the meeting, has been informed about the bill. Kelly said he would look into it. "Gen. Kelly indicated that the President is motivated to have a fix," CHC Chairwoman Michelle Lujan Grisham said. "He didn't say he'd sign the bill, but he definitely indicated there would be positive review." Gutierrez said he took notes on what Kelly said, quoting Kelly: "If this is the best we can do, the President will sign it." Frustration remains Still, lawmakers expressed frustration with the lack of progress. Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva said the meeting was a "rehash" of old meetings, with the same talking points and positions. New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez said it was a "regurgitation" of both sides and the administration is too fixated on the border. "We had a cordial conversation but we don't need a cordial conversation, we need a substantive one," he said. Part of the group that negotiated the Senate compromise, Menendez said the administration's position on a deal is a "continuously moving" target and "it continuously expands." Both men said DACA recipients were being "held hostage" to extract concessions. Two emotional moments Two moments in the Kelly meeting that were more emotional than the rest of the cordial conversation, a source in the room said. At one point, things got a bit tense when Kelly used the term "chain migration" and Rep. Linda Sanchez confronted him, saying that's a term considered offensive and the issue is actually family reunification. "Please don't use that term," she said. Kelly didn't apologize or discuss it further but took it in, and later in the meeting acknowledged the term is disputed when discussing the issue. Apology from Gutierrez The source also said Gutierrez took a moment to say, noting he wanted to say it in front of colleagues, that he wanted to acknowledge in the past he got heated and used words he shouldn't have, a reference to past comments he made about Kelly and his military service. Kelly made a joke about having done so as well and it was positive, the source said. On the House floor in September, Gutierrez said: "General Kelly, when he was the head of Homeland Security, lied straight to the faces of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus about preventing the mass deportation of (DACA recipients). ... General Kelly is a hypocrite who is a disgrace to the uniform he used to wear."

1654\Politics\(CNN)If House Republicans can't find a way to wrangle their always-fractious conference to support legislation that would avoid a government shutdown by Friday night, they are likely to bear the brunt of the blame for the closure and pay a serious political price as well. The "why" is simple. Because a) the GOP controls all levers of power -- House, Senate and White House -- in Washington and b) average people are aware of a). "Republicans control the House, they control the Senate and they control the presidency," Vermont Sen. Pat Leahy told CNN on Tuesday. "The government stays open if they want it to stay open and shuts down if they want it to shut down." Yes, Leahy is a Democrat. But, smart Republicans know he's absolutely right. It's why Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has repeatedly said -- in the face of these shutdown showdowns -- that "there's not going to be a government shutdown. It's just not going to happen." It's why Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told The New York Times that "to believe that you can successfully blame Democrats for a shutdown over the DACA debate is naive." History is instructive here. Go back to the last government shutdown -- in the fall of 2013. Republicans held the majority in the House, but Democratic President Barack Obama sat in the White House. And yet, despite this split control, the blame fell squarely on the shoulders of congressional Republicans. In a Washington Post-ABC poll conducted shortly after the shutdown ended, a majority of Americans (53%) blamed Republicans for the impasse while 29% blamed Obama. In that same poll, just 1 in 3 people said they had a favorable view of the Republican Party -- the lowest that number had been in the history of the poll. (Nota bene: A year later, Republicans went on to score major gains in the 2014 midterms -- a sign, some argued, that the shutdown didn't hurt them. Wrong! The shutdown quite clearly damaged the GOP brand but distaste for Obama and Obamacare was so strong that it overwhelmed doubts voters had about Republicans.) The "blame" numbers in the 2013 shutdown were very similar to how the blame game shook out in the twin shutdowns of late 1995 and early 1996. After those shutdowns, the Post-ABC poll showed that a majority of people (50%) blamed the Republican congressional majority for the government closure while 27% blamed then-President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. Most Republicans blame that shutdown -- and the role then-Speaker Newt Gingrich played in it -- for Clinton's glide-path reelection victory over Bob Dole in 1996. And, remember, those shutdowns were in eras of split control in Washington. We don't have that right now. If anything, then, the blame for a government shutdown would fall even more squarely on Republicans this time around than in either 1996 or 2013. People blame whoever they think is in charge. And although in the past two shutdowns that was somewhat up for debate, it isn't this time around. Which is why tweets from President Donald Trump insisting that "Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security" won't work. Sure, the base of the GOP will respond to that red-meat-throwing. But, there is no amount of Trump tweets that can overcome the fact that Republicans totally control Washington at the moment. The overall political environment heading into this shutdown showdown also looks more toxic for Republicans than in the past two shutdowns. Democrats had an 18-point lead in the generic ballot in a December CNN/ORC poll. That same poll showed Democrats with a 17-point enthusiasm edge over Republicans about voting in 2018. And, results on the ground -- from the state legislative level to the US Senate -- suggest that Democrats already have the wind at their backs with less than 300 days left before the 2018 midterms. Given all of that, a government shutdown would almost certainly have near-disastrous consequences for Republicans already on their back foot, politically speaking. Which, of course, doesn't mean it won't happen. Just that if it does, Republicans had better start bracing for a major political impact.

1655\Politics\Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's first year in office was rocked by a barrage of high-profile staff departures -- an exodus that is expected to continue during his second year once aides who are determined to make it one year on the job have satisfied their goal. Michael Flynn, who briefly served as Trump's national security adviser, was the first significant departure of the Trump administration. He served in the job for less than a month, and recently pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the former Russian ambassador to the US. The list only grew as the year went on -- including, but not limited to: the deputy chief of staff, the first communications director, the press secretary, the chief of staff, the second communications director, the chief strategist, a deputy assistant, a third communications director, the FBI director, the deputy national security adviser, the director of Oval Office operations and the director of communications for the White House's Office of Public Liaison. Several staffers are expected to announce their exits in the coming weeks, and chief of staff John Kelly has told several of them to decide by the end of the month whether they intend to leave or stay. Asked who in the White House was considering leaving their post in the coming weeks, one staffer quipped to CNN, "Who isn't?" Here's a list of the highest-profile West Wing casualties: Michael Flynn -- national security adviser Flynn lasted less than a month on the job. He is the first Trump administration official to be charged as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. Katie Walsh -- deputy chief of staff Walsh left her White House post after just two months on the job. Her position wasn't filled for several months until now-chief of staff John Kelly entered the West Wing, putting Kirstjen Nielsen in the role. Nielsen left to replace Kelly as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Mike Dubke -- communications director Trump's first official communications director submitted his resignation in May. He was a last-minute addition to the administration following the resignation of Jason Miller, who served on Trump's campaign. Dubke's appointment came with some criticism, as CNN reported at the time that some inside the White House said they would have preferred a campaign veteran. Sean Spicer -- press secretary Spicer, who became must-see TV and was mercilessly mocked by NBC's "Saturday Night Live," resigned amid communications office tumult. His tenure was marked mostly by his gaffes, including using the phrase "Holocaust centers" and making false claims about inauguration crowd sizes. Reince Preibus -- chief of staff The former Republican National Committee chairman became the shortest-serving chief of staff in White House history after he was driven out of the administration after just six months and replaced by then-Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Anthony Scaramucci -- communications director "The Mooch" was removed from his post as communications director after just 11 days on the job after he accused Priebus of leaking damaging information about him in a profanity-laced interview with The New Yorker. Keith Schiller -- director of Oval Office Operations Schiller's departure -- which was for personal reasons -- was noteworthy because of his years of loyalty and proximity to the President. Schiller was among a handful of aides from Trump's previous life as a businessman to follow Trump into the White House. It was Schiller who delivered James Comey the letter informing him he was fired. Steve Bannon -- chief strategist Though the White House initially insisted Bannon's departure was a mutual decision, Trump later declared he fired him because he had become an ineffective "lighting rod" after he made disparaging comments about Donald Trump Jr. in Michael Wolff's new tell-all book. Omarosa Manigault Newman -- communications director at the White House Office of Public Liaison Omarosa, the former "Apprentice" star with a long history with Trump, left the White House in December. Though her role was ill-defined, her departure was significant because it highlighted how few African-Americans hold senior positions in the West Wing.

1656\Politics\Washington (CNN)The escalating immigration drama is crystallizing for some lawmakers and presidential advisers their long-held views of John Kelly, President Donald Trump's chief of staff: He's a fierce advocate for hardline policies that drastically limit the number of people entering the US. And he'll remain so, even as the government barrels toward a potential shutdown over the issue. "Kelly is a hardass," said one Republican lawmaker, who requested anonymity to discuss Kelly's approach to immigration. "Some people might think he's softer; he's a hardass, also. And a straight, straight shooter. He doesn't sugar coat things." Kelly has been seen as a stabilizing force on an erratic presidency, taming an unorganized White House. He appealed to Democrats Wednesday by calling Trump "uninformed" on some immigration issues, according to a source familiar with the comments. But such moves don't change the fact that the administration, with Kelly's full support, will continue to aggressively enforce immigration laws, according to a senior government official. And Kelly is the person who helped sink a bipartisan immigration deal that emerged last week. The White house chief of staff warned Trump the agreement would incite anger among his base, who expect him to deliver on his promises to build a border wall and deport undocumented immigrants, according to two White House officials and a congressional source familiar with the situation. And he sent word to Capitol Hill, where like-minded Republican lawmakers were summoned with minutes to spare to attend a White House sit-down with the crafters of the deal, who later claimed they were blindsided by the move. Kelly's tactics, which culminated in a heated, profanity-laced Oval Office meeting, disappointed some lawmakers and administration aides, who have privately expressed fears that his hardline views are obscuring chances for an immigration deal. And it opened him to criticism from some lawmakers, who began publicly saying this week that Trump isn't well served by his staff. Full scope of voices Kelly's supporters say he is merely ensuring the President is hearing from a full scope of voices as he weighs various proposals on an issue that was central to his rollicking presidential campaign. And the White House has publicly downplayed Kelly's role in orchestrating last Thursday's meeting, which devolved into Trump deriding some countries as "shitholes" or "shithouses," depending on the telling. Instead, the White House has insisted that it was Trump's decision to invite Republicans to the session in the hopes of hearing their views on the emerging plan. Speaking Wednesday, Kelly said the bipartisan agreement offered by Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham and Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin didn't meet Trump's criteria. "That deal that came over was supposed to be two things: bipartisan and both sides of the Hill," Kelly told reporters on Capitol Hill in between meetings. "There were a number of other senators that had been involved in this from the beginning ... that were not consulted." "The President has said from the beginning, it's got to be bipartisan and unless it involves the House as well as the Senate, it's going to go down again as a bill that does not pass into law," he said. Kelly met for an hour Wednesday with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and listened to concerns about how the administration has approached immigration. The meeting was "cordial" and "positive," participants said, but didn't produce any new path toward an agreement. While lawmakers made a point to say they appreciated the session, they expressed disappointment that Kelly had not come armed with any proposals to negotiate and that he didn't seem well-versed in the bipartisan proposals under development in Congress. Among the concerns aired in the meeting were the administration's use of the term "chain migration" to describe the process of citizens and green card holders bringing their extended family to the US. "Please don't use that term," Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-California, told Kelly, explaining the phrase is considered loaded and offensive. Kelly didn't apologize, but acknowledged the term is disputed, according to a source in the room. Spearheading immigration talks As the immigration debate has heated up, Trump tasked Kelly with spearheading talks on the issue in the hopes of striking a deal that would adhere to his campaign promises. He's taken more of a personal role in meetings with aides and lawmakers, where his deeply held views have been apparent, according to people who have participated in them. That has led to some grumbling from other administration officials, who believe Kelly's hardline stance on immigration has obfuscated opposing views. As secretary of Homeland Security, Kelly gained the President's approval by channeling the unwavering immigration stance that Trump espoused on the campaign trail, despite offering what appeared to be a more moderate stance during his confirmation hearing a year ago -- including downplaying the importance of a border wall. His ardent approach -- paired with a no-nonsense Boston accent and a Marine's rigor -- is what led Trump to name him chief of staff, people familiar with Trump's thinking say. His mandate entering the West Wing was to instill order among warring factions of aides and streamline the flow of information to the President. Outsiders also viewed him as a potentially moderating force on a President whose brash outbursts and appeals to nationalist sentiments had alienated some voters and establishment politicians. But Kelly has sought to manage expectations, and has bolstered Trump during some of his most controversial moments, including backing up his views on Confederate monuments and appearing in the White House briefing room to defend Trump's phone call with the grieving widow of a slain US serviceman. Toughest job Kelly has told friends his role as Trump's top aide has been the toughest job of his career, which has included deployments in Iraq and as commander of US Southern Command. But he's also described the chief of staff role as immensely rewarding. On immigration, Kelly has been supported inside the West Wing by Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser whose hardline views on immigration are well known. Miller has been a staunch and outspoken proponent of limiting immigration to the US, and is viewed as the White House's guiding voice on the matter -- to the chagrin of Democrats working to strike an agreement. "It's hard to find any effort to kill immigration legislation that doesn't have Steve Miller's fingerprints on it," Durbin said on Tuesday. "He's been an outspoken foe of immigration reform and opponent to DACA and the Dreamers from the start." Kelly is "more of an adult," one person familiar with the situation said, and Trump believes that with him in charge, there's a better chance of getting something done. Another person said Kelly respects Miller but is the clear person in charge. While Kelly may foster more goodwill on Capitol Hill than Miller -- who gained notoriety as an outspoken and rabble-rousing congressional aide -- the chief of staff's actions over the past week have prompted some lawmakers to air their misgivings publicly. "I don't think the President was well served by his staff," Graham said on Tuesday, adding later: "I think someone on his staff gave him really bad advice between 10 and 12 on Thursday." Asked whether he pinned the blame on Kelly, who as chief of staff has demanded rigorous order in the West Wing, Graham demurred: "I think General Kelly is a fine man but he's also part of the staff." On Wednesday, Kelly darted between meetings on Capitol Hill meant to restart immigration talks after last Thursday's profanity-laden meeting. Aside from the Hispanic lawmakers, he met with four moderate Republicans, followed by two leaders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and then went to meet with the bipartisan congressional leaders who are attempting to negotiate a deal. Asked as he departed whether he would take into account the diverse set of views he'd heard, Kelly answered affirmatively. "Yeah, sure," he said. \1.377515435218811,0.07625861465930939,-0.1372155249118805,-1.0648988485336304,1.0276225805282593,-1.5958932638168335,0.663554847240448,0.4513588845729828,-0.8039992451667786,0.5051969885826111,0.818570077419281,0.10501870512962341,0.4249090254306793,0.9148430824279785,0.18240192532539368,0.2612135410308838,0.6102585792541504,0.3965563476085663,-1.3743524551391602,-0.8449914455413818,0.17088058590888977,-1.3299294710159302,1.1726319789886475,-0.7816615104675293,-2.0216431617736816,1.6974496841430664,1.5162678956985474,0.38480618596076965,-0.393755167722702,-1.4868861436843872,0.5660747289657593,1.9217554330825806,0.4081941545009613,-0.07314354181289673,0.5049227476119995,-0.17472195625305176,-0.9734918475151062,0.47647106647491455,1.6192649602890015,-1.7843843698501587,-1.2890909910202026,-0.8692523241043091,1.1398543119430542,-0.6493152976036072,-0.7225417494773865,-0.08215682953596115,1.032129168510437,-1.3670234680175781,-1.6939715147018433,-0.5277999639511108,2.4507594108581543,-0.45737335085868835,0.9914717674255371,-1.1283241510391235,0.75458824634552,-0.30824536085128784,0.017749419435858727,-0.508629322052002,-2.1809699535369873,1.1726616621017456,-1.96821129322052,-0.6655522584915161,-0.1390479952096939,0.36414965987205505,-2.3688783645629883,1.298586368560791,0.09673365205526352,1.459913730621338,-1.3801286220550537,1.37593674659729,2.1874592304229736,-0.38476353883743286,-1.900357723236084,0.16541944444179535,-1.8187428712844849,-1.866141676902771,0.4856150150299072,0.19009868800640106,-0.2813093364238739,-0.37037140130996704,0.3129453957080841,0.09205464273691177,-0.9949811100959778,0.1786193549633026,0.26685482263565063,1.3332113027572632,0.38529694080352783,0.856439471244812,-0.3350573778152466,-1.2535395622253418,-0.538855254650116,-0.272036075592041,-3.0864148139953613,0.491181880235672,-0.7271814942359924,0.8360564708709717,-1.0407744646072388,-2.066295623779297,-0.9117829203605652,-0.04140229895710945\CNN\John Kelly: Immigration 'hardass'\2018-01-18 14:48:05.0\1656, 1658
1657\Politics\Washington (CNN)Steve Bannon has struck a deal with special counsel Robert Mueller's team and will be interviewed by prosecutors instead of testifying before the grand jury, two people familiar with the process told CNN. He is expected to cooperate with the special counsel, the sources said. The sources did not say when the interview will take place or if the subpoena would be withdrawn. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist for President Donald Trump, is expected to talk openly to Mueller's team. Bannon's attorney told the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that Bannon would answer questions when he goes to the special counsel because executive privilege would not apply, according to one of the sources. A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment. Last week, the FBI attempted to serve Bannon with a subpoena to appear before the grand jury in the Russia probe. He referred agents to his attorney, multiple sources said. Bannon's deal with the special counsel follows the publishing of Michael Wolff's book "Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House," which claimed Bannon called the June 2016 meeting between senior Trump presidential campaign staff and a Russian lawyer promising dirt on Hillary Clinton "treasonous." In testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, Bannon downplayed the comments published in Wolff's book, saying it was "hyperbole" that he described the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and members of the Trump campaign with Russians as treasonous and unpatriotic, two sources said. Bannon, who joined the campaign after the June 2016 meeting, and shed little light on the meeting with Russians, the sources said. One reason Mueller may have issued a subpoena is that Bannon publicly changed his story when he issued a statement on the book's contents, walking back some of what was reported, a source told CNN. The source familiar with the process with Bannon said Mueller's team may have been seeking to send a message that he needs to be truthful about what happened. California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN that the White House instructed Bannon not to answer questions regarding the presidential transition and his time in the White House. Schiff said a White House attorney other than White House counsel Don McGahn reconfirmed this should continue after the committee served Bannon with a subpoena during the interview yesterday. Two sources tell CNN the White House attorney was Uttam Dhillon. McGahn and Bannon share the same attorney, William Burck.

1658\Politics\Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump has "changed his attitude toward the DACA issue and even the wall," White House chief of staff John Kelly said Wednesday. Kelly's comments followed reports that in a meeting Wednesday, he told Democratic lawmakers that some of Trump's positions as a candidate on the border wall were "uninformed," sources told CNN. Kelly, speaking with Fox News' Bret Baier, said he had met with the House Hispanic Caucus to discuss where the President stands on various issues regarding immigration, including the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. "I told them ... that this has been an evolutionary process that this President has gone through," Kelly said Wednesday on Fox, responding to the "uninformed" reports. He later continued: "I pointed out to all of the members that were in the room that they all say things during the course of campaigns that may or may not be fully informed." Kelly was addressing the continuing immigration debate in Congress. Trump has held several meetings on immigration with members of Congress, including a notable closed-door meeting last week that made headlines when reports surfaced that he had made vulgar remarks about various countries. "This President, if you've seen what he's done, he has changed the way he's looked at a number of things," Kelly said, citing a number of issues including South Asia, Afghanistan and DACA.

1659\Politics\Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump promised that his administration is "working on it" as he faced a flurry of questions Wednesday about discussions to reach an immigration deal and fund the government. "We're working on it. We're working on it," Trump told reporters as he walked down the halls of Congress after attending an award ceremony honoring former Sen. Bob Dole. His comments come as congressional leaders of both parties and top White House officials continue to negotiate an agreement to fund the government days before it is set to run out of money. Trump's time on Capitol Hill was not spent negotiating with congressional leaders he has rankled in recent days after making disparaging comments about African countries and Haiti during a meeting with lawmakers last week, but his chief of staff John Kelly made the rounds of key lawmakers' offices on Wednesday in pursuit of a deal. Kelly has been leading the White House's efforts to reach a deal to give legal status to undocumented immigrants who will soon no longer be protected by the expiring DACA protections, while also increasing border security funding. Democrats and some Republicans looking to extend those protections have threatened not to vote to keep the government open unless a DACA deal is reached by Friday. But with an immigration deal appearing no closer to being brokered, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that Trump would support a short-term deal to keep the government open while broader negotiations continue. And with the prospects of a shutdown, the White House is already kicking a preemptive blame game into gear. Sanders argued Democrats should be blamed if the government shuts down. "The President certainly doesn't want a shutdown. And if one happens, I think you have only one place to look, and that's to the Democrats," Sanders said earlier Wednesday. CNN's Kristin Wilson and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.\0.47240760922431946,0.08234577625989914,0.6345845460891724,-0.9343315958976746,0.5400934815406799,-0.4507381021976471,-0.009862424805760384,0.0947161540389061,-1.0489661693572998,-1.014748215675354,1.099047303199768,0.4585936963558197,-0.10233511030673981,0.35648322105407715,0.3766159415245056,-0.7852257490158081,0.6136317253112793,-0.39357322454452515,0.4892391562461853,-0.9469010829925537,0.08867098391056061,-0.6347296833992004,-0.644321620464325,-0.7142800688743591,-0.8947383761405945,0.5118369460105896,0.41530677676200867,0.29538995027542114,0.004478478338569403,-0.11048939824104309,-0.8071342706680298,1.0421684980392456,0.16814815998077393,-0.0905495211482048,0.5317457914352417,-1.1997284889221191,-0.32567134499549866,0.5365813970565796,0.014492726884782314,-1.5954315662384033,-0.2148808389902115,-0.8307878375053406,0.3957946002483368,-0.6900399327278137,0.7127227783203125,0.015802405774593353,0.02177712880074978,-0.2913192808628082,-0.2611463665962219,-0.42933958768844604,0.023874927312135696,-0.3307170867919922,-0.02508620172739029,0.0877012237906456,1.0919369459152222,-0.6494982242584229,0.1459723711013794,0.22383633255958557,-0.6891449093818665,-0.03729725256562233,0.11548415571451187,-0.3008900284767151,0.6982879638671875,0.7704713344573975,-0.9871358275413513,0.08744551241397858,0.4248340427875519,0.8783733248710632,-0.5762145519256592,0.7243384122848511,0.4192943871021271,0.058485083281993866,0.003911255858838558,0.6608931422233582,-0.4900412857532501,0.13759662210941315,-0.2572885751724243,0.5789949297904968,-0.4511406421661377,0.16149738430976868,0.8223158121109009,-0.038410626351833344,-0.23903250694274902,0.4883909225463867,0.4417850077152252,1.0934916734695435,0.15268932282924652,0.03646477684378624,-0.3591242730617523,0.010424456559121609,0.398725688457489,-0.30655142664909363,-1.0040315389633179,-0.28715476393699646,0.05593985319137573,0.08538902550935745,-0.2388283759355545,-0.13420826196670532,-0.7593241333961487,0.4726960062980652\CNN\Trump weighs in on immigration, funding talks: 'Working on it'\2018-01-17 23:38:58.0\1521, 1557, 1639, 1659
1660\Politics\Washington (CNN)One year after Donald Trump's inauguration, public opinion polling has offered little positive news for the President so far. It's well-known by now that Trump is the least popular president at this point in his term since modern surveys began more than seven decades ago. Plus, a majority of the American people disapprove of his handling of nearly every event and policy priority during his first year -- from the Russia investigation to Charlottesville, from withdrawing from the Paris climate pact to rescinding the immigration program known as DACA, from his travel ban to tax reform to efforts to repeal Obamacare. The booming economy, on which Trump has gotten a virtually even split over the his first year, remains the one major exception to that rule. (Take Trump's name out of the poll question and nearly 7-in-10 Americans say the economy is in good shape.) Trump also got more positive reviews than negatives ones for nominating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and progress on the war against ISIS. Still, the bottom hasn't fallen out. Trump's approval rating has remained consistently locked in around 37% -- plus or minus depending on which way the wind is blowing -- for the last nine months, according to weekly numbers from Gallup. But Trump's approval ratings aren't just noteworthy because they are low. They are also the flattest, least fluid approval ratings for any elected president since modern surveys started. In fact, Trump's numbers are almost too steady. During his first year, Trump's approval ratings have stayed within a narrow 10-point range -- from 45% at his inauguration to a low of 35% multiple times over the last several months. Former President Barack Obama's had moved 18 points, George W. Bush's had moved 39 points and Bill Clinton's had moved 22 points to this point in their tenures. In fact, only Lyndon B. Johnson had less movement in approval polling during his first year in office. It shows that opinions of Trump are baked in -- also demonstrated by this August poll showing that 6-in-10 people who approve Trump said they can't think of anything Trump can do to make them stop approving of his job performance. What's more, at the one-year mark, Trump has the most polarized approval gap between his own party and the opposing party in the same time span. In the latest Gallup numbers, 82% of Republicans approve of Trump vs. only 9% of Democrats who approve of him, marking the widest gap between a President's own party and the opposing party in data back to the 1950s. The vast, 73-point split is mostly due to Trump's nearly unanimous disapproval among Democrats. \-0.2763735055923462,-1.0117783546447754,0.26057469844818115,-0.21341069042682648,1.219200849533081,0.0742829367518425,7.079306524246931E-4,0.628357470035553,-0.839832067489624,-0.8465968370437622,1.729996919631958,-0.3359757959842682,-0.11667320132255554,-0.6921337842941284,-0.3591557443141937,0.7718266844749451,0.43794432282447815,0.6339685916900635,-0.29703760147094727,-1.3731695413589478,0.3323618471622467,0.49265360832214355,-0.254059374332428,-0.592804491519928,-1.0301793813705444,1.7595114707946777,0.6991224884986877,-0.37725669145584106,-0.36752790212631226,-1.4508709907531738,0.30082499980926514,-0.13769707083702087,1.3672384023666382,0.7230907678604126,0.12455836683511734,0.1422048807144165,0.12697452306747437,-0.849791944026947,0.5513951778411865,0.11002455651760101,1.0761325359344482,-0.49223360419273376,0.6273469924926758,-0.5905992388725281,0.36799919605255127,0.5055733919143677,-0.12214303761720657,0.36710426211357117,-1.6012588739395142,-0.7508357763290405,1.1977524757385254,-1.3023626804351807,-0.04948536306619644,-0.02578634023666382,0.3777252733707428,-0.31413736939430237,0.6750971674919128,0.0787612721323967,-1.852393627166748,-0.11931316554546356,-0.6500067710876465,-0.3945775628089905,-0.8619810342788696,0.4630310833454132,-0.9354061484336853,0.1879945546388626,0.0391213521361351,0.44189897179603577,-0.17854665219783783,0.3720417320728302,-0.3491760194301605,-0.06548970937728882,-1.7328859567642212,-0.1475069522857666,-1.2289369106292725,0.010618523694574833,0.69850093126297,0.44293609261512756,0.6598655581474304,-0.21223624050617218,-0.046438876539468765,0.035856880247592926,-0.5367387533187866,0.993843138217926,-0.9257609248161316,0.32985082268714905,0.0025704400613904,1.3511945009231567,0.4127918481826782,-1.1966612339019775,0.4153917133808136,-0.33567047119140625,-1.151737928390503,0.6777724027633667,0.39197003841400146,1.2294971942901611,0.02081097848713398,-0.6812890768051147,-0.35220909118652344,-1.3148096799850464\CNN\What we learned from 365 days of Trump polls\2018-01-17 20:42:42.0\1585, 1648, 1660
1661\Politics\Washington (CNN)US President Donald Trump may have found another whipping boy when it comes to reining in North Korea. On Wednesday, Trump accused the Kremlin of helping North Korea skirt international sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. "Russia is not helping us at all with North Korea," Trump told Reuters in an interview. "What China is helping us with, Russia is denting. In other words, Russia is making up for some of what China is doing." Trump's rare criticism of Russia came as he commended China for largely complying with international sanctions passed in 2017 that have targeted North Korean shipping, coal, seafood and labor. His comments appear to reference reports that Russian tankers have helped refuel North Korea with shipments at sea, and follows allegations from US officials that Russia has been lax in its implementation of UN Security Council sanctions. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov told state media Thursday that the accusations made by the United States were "absolutely unfounded." "Russia is fulfilling its obligations under the corresponding UN Security Council resolutions in full," he added. "The relevant UN Sanctions Committees do not set any claims to us (with regard to fulfilling the sanctions against North Korea)." Trump welcomed the ongoing dialogue between the two Koreas regarding next month's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Reuters reported, but said he didn't think direct US talks with Kim Jong Un would solve anything. On Wednesday, South Korea announced its athletes will march with their Northern counterparts at the Winter Olympics opening ceremony under a unified flag, a diplomatic breakthrough following days of talks between the two countries. Russia's role US Senator Tammy Duckworth, who returned to the US from a trip to South Korea and Japan on Tuesday, said it is clear that the Russians and Chinese continue to aid North Korea despite additional sanctions. "The Russians are definitely providing supplies to the North Koreans and so are the Chinese. It is very clear both the Russians and Chinese are violating the additional sanctions," the Illinois Democrat told reporters Wednesday. Russia officially employs some 40,000 North Korean migrant workers, and possibly more, many of whom work in construction in major Russian cities. Some analysts worry that Moscow will find loopholes for them to stay, citing "humanitarian" reasons. "The two countries that consume the most North Korean slave labor are China and Russia," she said. In late December, the US spearheaded the passage of a UN Security Council Resolution that levied the toughest restrictions on North Korea to date, banning exports of industrial equipment, machinery, transportation vehicles and industrial metals to the hermit nation. Marshall Billingslea, the assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the US Treasury Department, showed a US Senate panel in September how a handful of vessels were skirting sanctions by transporting illicit North Korean coal while traveling between China and Russia. Billingslea also said North Korean bank representatives "operate in Russia in flagrant disregard of the very resolutions adopted by Russia at the UN." Experts CNN spoke with believe that while Russian firms or individuals may have helped North Korea, the scale of those operations are relatively small. "I don't think that the Russians can offer what the North Koreans are really looking for," said Anthony Ruggiero, an expert in the use of targeted financial measures at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. "The North Koreans might be able to replace parts of the sanctions evasions schemes they have going in China, but they're not going to be able to pick up wholesale and move," he said. 'Closer every day' In his interview with Reuters, Trump seemed to acknowledge the significant progress that North Korea has made in its pursuit of developing long-range ballistic missiles that can be paired with nuclear weapons. When asked if he believes Pyongyang has the ability to strike the US, Trump said "they're not there yet, but they're close. And they get closer every day." According to Abraham Denmark, the director of the Asia Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia, these types of comments from the President show that Washington and Pyongyang may be on a "collision course" if both sides stick to their current positions. "What's needed is diplomacy, what's needed is flexibility and what's needed is a recognition that the military options come with enormous risks and potentially devastating costs," said Denmark. Trump also declined for the second time in as many weeks to confirm whether he has communicated with Kim Jong Un during the interview. He reaffirmed that he is open to sitting down with Kim, but expressed doubt that direct talks would help. "I'd sit down, but I'm not sure that sitting down will solve the problem," Trump said. "I'm not sure that talks will lead to anything meaningful," he said. "They've talked for 25 years and they've taken advantage of our presidents, of our previous presidents." The US and its allies are concerned that the face-to-face negotiations between the two Koreas, the most substantive talks in more than two years, may be a stalling tactic for Pyongyang. Speaking Tuesday during a conference in Vancouver, Canada, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said Pyongyang's weapon program remained an ongoing threat. "I believe that North Korea wants to buy some time to continue their nuclear and missile programs." US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday that it's crucial for the international community to continue its current pressure campaign against the Kim regime. He also said both Russia and China must tighten their enforcement of existing sanctions. "We cannot abide lapses or sanctions evasions. We will continue to call attention to and designate entities and individuals complicit in such evasive actions," Tillerson said in Vancouver. China and Russia were not present at the meeting, which Beijing denounced as demonstrating a "Cold War mentality." Putin warning Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered vocal support for the North Korean regime and has publicly questioned the efficacy of sanctions. Speaking at a September forum in the Russian city of Vladivostok, Putin condemned what he called Pyongyang's "provocative" nuclear tests, but he said he understood North Korean concerns and offered a warning to Kim about what happens when leaders give up their nuclear weapons. North Koreans "know exactly how the situation developed in Iraq," Putin said, pointing to the US invasion of Iraq in spite of the country abandoning its nuclear weapons program. \-0.16539731621742249,0.10901542752981186,0.3519875109195709,0.6222132444381714,-0.13101060688495636,-0.6384015679359436,3.493657350540161,-1.2715997695922852,-0.21329954266548157,-0.9738394618034363,1.1606507301330566,1.1510546207427979,0.0503978468477726,1.2214815616607666,-0.7847748398780823,-0.6104264855384827,-0.11614113301038742,-0.05294754356145859,-0.654291033744812,-0.6366804838180542,0.6163855791091919,-0.9584903717041016,-0.1982039511203766,-0.5172379612922668,0.6644627451896667,-0.8533647656440735,-0.5679277181625366,1.0153061151504517,-0.5496743321418762,-0.8765405416488647,0.09222198277711868,0.6290556192398071,-0.04349898919463158,0.011098499409854412,0.5782864689826965,-0.9610432386398315,0.6938745975494385,-0.2750166952610016,0.8872647285461426,0.2448272854089737,-1.364798665046692,-1.6543675661087036,0.34724920988082886,-0.7560593485832214,-0.40787407755851746,0.09601891785860062,0.15368220210075378,-0.32761311531066895,-0.4582597017288208,-0.05856233835220337,0.27882498502731323,1.0225402116775513,-0.19064436852931976,-0.5293983817100525,0.6257607340812683,-2.658076524734497,1.1227617263793945,0.6159032583236694,-1.6236670017242432,0.249964639544487,1.3576213121414185,-1.1357935667037964,0.5590972900390625,-0.4559580385684967,-1.8565127849578857,1.2328687906265259,2.893925666809082,-0.5363889932632446,-0.8603624701499939,0.5475058555603027,-0.13857078552246094,-1.7109525203704834,-0.3970034718513489,1.1597377061843872,-1.9235936403274536,-1.2116087675094604,0.14241820573806763,-0.5031228065490723,-0.17564915120601654,-0.9653719663619995,-0.5358242988586426,0.8099150061607361,-0.48076167702674866,0.5020052790641785,1.1887245178222656,0.352616548538208,0.5596301555633545,-0.7011151909828186,0.17776323854923248,0.5180769562721252,-0.9026856422424316,0.3780362010002136,-2.3276803493499756,-0.14337308704853058,0.31359195709228516,-0.6630709171295166,-0.946016252040863,-1.4414311647415161,-1.043516993522644,0.0015028096968308091\CNN\Trump says 'Russia is not helping' with North Korea\2018-01-18 10:52:07.0\1661, 1552, 1577
1662\Politics\Washington (CNN)At one rally after the next, candidate Donald Trump lamented the "trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost" in the Middle East, criticized his opponent as a warmonger and signaled he would scale back US military commitments abroad. "America First" would become the driving mantra, and the US would refocus taxpayer dollars on domestic problems rather than foreign ones, he said. Much of the Washington foreign policy establishment worried that Trump would usher in a diminished -- perhaps even isolated -- US posture. But in his first year as commander in chief, Trump has largely discarded the non-interventionist campaign rhetoric, expanding the US military footprint around the world and demonstrating a willingness to use military force to confront even indirect threats to the US. He has escalated the US war in Afghanistan -- signing off on the latest open-ended chapter of the 16-year war -- launched US strikes against Syrian government targets for the first time in that country's civil war and beefed up US military campaigns across two continents. Just as significantly, Trump has kept the wide-reaching elements of US military might around the world -- like the US bases in foreign countries whose importance he questioned during the campaign -- intact. "So far, this President has struck with the advocates of strength and action," said Anthony Cordesman, a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Competing impulses Trump's first year as commander in chief was not a blatant flip-flop, though. Instead, it was the product of competing impulses that have not only defined the military decisions he has confronted in office but also had revealed themselves during the campaign. While his remarks as a candidate were peppered with notable criticism -- particularly in Republican politics -- of US military engagements in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya and of proposals to directly confront the Syrian regime, Trump also argued for a more aggressive fight against ISIS. And on that front, he has followed through, empowering military commanders on the ground to ramp up the fight against ISIS with increased airstrikes and troop levels that have hastened the pace of victory. The moves have led to the ouster of ISIS from its capital in Raqqa and nearly all of its territory across Syria and Iraq. Those sweeping victories are now raising new questions about the US's long-term presence in the Middle East. So far, the Trump administration has offered no indication that it plans to pull the more than 7,000 US troops deployed to Iraq and Syria. And beyond ISIS, Trump has greenlighted the expansion of US counterterrorism campaigns in other Middle East countries and in Africa -- even when ISIS is not the target. US airstrikes against terror groups have more than doubled in Somalia, according to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Long War Journal, which tracks US military campaigns. And in Yemen, the US air campaign largely targeting al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has delivered more airstrikes than the previous four years combined, according to the Long War Journal. The swelling US military posture around the world under Trump has served as only the latest piece of confirmation that Trump would not be the non-interventionist president that some had hoped he would be. The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. 'Some hope' Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who's a prominent proponent of a non-interventionist US military policy, said he had "some hope" as he listened to Trump lament US foreign military entanglements during the campaign. "To the extent you could rely on rhetoric, he looked a lot better than his opponent," Bandow said. "He was making some of the right critiques." But whatever hopes Bandow had have been crushed repeatedly in the last year with Trump's decision to strike a Syrian airbase with 59 Tomahawk missiles, followed by the President's Afghanistan decision, which Bandow called "a signature moment that suggested whatever his gut feelings were going to be, we weren't likely to see them resolved in policy." While there was always "an inherent contradiction" in Trump's rhetoric lamenting US foreign military engagements while calling for a stepped-up military campaign against ISIS, "at least there was a contradiction," Bandow said. Even in December 2016, a month after his election, Trump continued to promise an end to a policy of "intervention and chaos." "We don't want to have a depleted military because we're all over the place fighting in areas that we shouldn't be fighting in. It's not going to be depleted any longer," he declared. Contradiction The contradiction hasn't evaporated altogether, though, as exemplified by the debate over the US strategy in Afghanistan, which stretched months longer than initially anticipated due to Trump's misgivings about deepening US involvement in the war and the debate over its merits that roiled his top advisers. It's a contradiction that Trump acknowledged directly as he announced his decision to sign off on a strategy that would send several thousand more US troops to fight in a conflict entering its 17th year. "My original instinct was to pull out -- and, historically, I like following my instincts," Trump said. "But all my life, I've heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office; in other words, when you're President of the United States." What has also changed is the coterie of experienced foreign policy advisers and military generals that now surround the President, namely his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, his defense secretary, James Mattis, who's a retired four-star general, and his chief of staff, retired four-star Gen. John Kelly. "This President has appointed a national security adviser, a secretary of defense and a secretary of state who all are very pragmatic but who also really believe in asserting American strength and acting more decisively than the previous administration," said Cordesman, the Arleigh Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But while the results of his first year signal that Trump has sided with his instinct for a muscular US military posture over that of limiting US military exposure abroad, the half-dozen foreign policy experts CNN spoke to for this story said the administration's long-term national security strategy remains uncertain. That has largely been a product of the contradictions in Trump's rhetoric, but also is due to his penchant for making impulsive and unclear, if not contradictory, statements about his administration's policy. "I think people are right to be worried that the President's thinking is either contradictory or unsound and this is one of the costs of the President's undisciplined behavior," said Kori Schake, a fellow at the Hoover Institution who co-authored a book with Mattis and was openly critical of Trump during the campaign. "I think it is a mistake to believe this is going to smooth out and the President is going to have a clear, consistent policy." \-0.35475584864616394,1.0095664262771606,-1.7957171201705933,-0.1979227215051651,0.42479148507118225,-0.1433117836713791,1.1137607097625732,0.17978660762310028,-2.2919249534606934,-1.1502223014831543,1.5921868085861206,0.3487536907196045,-0.2149575799703598,1.7171603441238403,-1.347948431968689,0.4821178913116455,0.9794980883598328,0.8875696063041687,0.06442201882600784,-0.7743127942085266,0.15627773106098175,-1.8206182718276978,-0.17307956516742706,-0.17289108037948608,-1.325172781944275,0.5314408540725708,1.7503905296325684,0.27666613459587097,0.04821012169122696,-0.9684223532676697,-0.29442599415779114,2.3721258640289307,-0.37746238708496094,1.372960090637207,-0.025639981031417847,0.12109166383743286,0.26324209570884705,-1.5028537511825562,-1.2706793546676636,-1.2691473960876465,-1.5181807279586792,-1.4580919742584229,0.13680094480514526,-0.3641088008880615,0.4965466558933258,-0.015091453678905964,-0.7550579309463501,0.24643221497535706,-1.4342273473739624,0.03875511884689331,1.6915537118911743,-1.5757869482040405,0.3254254162311554,-0.6832133531570435,1.1530799865722656,0.8070340156555176,1.1526143550872803,1.5562063455581665,-0.8843599557876587,1.1952295303344727,0.3381621241569519,-0.7411091327667236,0.04370753839612007,-0.36609959602355957,-1.5129739046096802,1.5885494947433472,1.176673412322998,-1.0044243335723877,-1.7983715534210205,2.9093146324157715,0.6484344005584717,-0.6028384566307068,-0.6951634287834167,0.32092535495758057,-0.6557427048683167,0.4802429974079132,0.7389028072357178,0.3139100670814514,-1.8188637495040894,-1.0977431535720825,-0.7442604899406433,-0.5567907094955444,-0.6430771946907043,0.4414772391319275,0.34686198830604553,0.37397438287734985,0.0368901826441288,0.5751157999038696,1.101697325706482,-0.4542055130004883,-0.136959969997406,0.10056416690349579,-0.7566245198249817,1.1533466577529907,1.3633424043655396,0.21432426571846008,-0.8055535554885864,-2.1836040019989014,-0.6983802318572998,-0.7117577195167542\CNN\Trump expands US military footprint despite candidate Trump's rhetoric\2018-01-17 08:19:44.0\
1663\Politics\(CNN)Like most men of his age, President Donald Trump has a common form of heart disease, relatively easy to address if he increases the dose of his cholesterol-lowering medication and makes necessary lifestyle changes. Without those changes, the President has a moderate risk of having a heart attack in the next three to five years, according to the Mayo Clinic. On Tuesday, White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson disclosed Trump's basic labs measurements, physical exam results and the conclusion of a cognitive exam, known as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Additionally, the President had an echocardiogram of his heart, as well as a stress test, both described as normal. Although it was not part of the official medical records that were released yesterday, after further questioning, Jackson also revealed that Trump underwent a coronary calcium CT scan as part of his routine physical exam.  His score is 133, and anything over 100 indicates plaque is present and that the patient has heart disease. According to Trump's official medical records, in 2009 his coronary calcium score was 34. In 2013, it was 98.  Most people might have not heard of this test, also known simply as a heart scan or calcium score. It is a CT scan, a specialized X-ray that takes high quality pictures of the heart, looking for calcium-containing plaque in the blood vessels that feed the heart, known as the coronaries. With this information, doctors can then calculate the risk of having a heart problem in the future. In the case of Trump, a new score of 133 reveals there has been a steady build-up of plaque in his blood vessels, indicating moderate heart disease. Also concerning are Trump's total cholesterol levels and his LDL ("bad" cholesterol), as both increased significantly over the last year, despite being on a statin drug known as Crestor or Rosuvastatin.  Trump, 71, is not too different than most Americans his age. After the age of 40, most men in the United States have some evidence of heart disease, and the President's score places him squarely in the mid-risk range for a man of his age. Because the President doesn't smoke or drink and "appears to have good genes," according to Jackson, he has been able to avoid the classic symptoms of heart disease. "His score is 133 and he is 71 years of age, which puts him in the 46 percentile," said cardiologist Dr. Rachel Bond of Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. "What does this indicate? Yes, he certainly has coronary artery disease because calcium is present. But this is also common for someone his gender, race and age. "When I compare him to other males who are 71 and white, only 46% of others have a better score than him." Bond added this is not something to be taken lightly. A coronary calcium score below 100 reduces the risk of heart attack to moderate. Jackson has already increased the dosage of the Trump's cholesterol-lowering medication and recommended a low-carbohydrate and low-fat diet, along with an exercise regimen. Clarification: Additional information about coronary calcium scores has been added to this story.\-0.10818430781364441,-0.3071686625480652,-0.532256543636322,4.95592481456697E-4,0.33667153120040894,0.2390424609184265,0.33491459488868713,0.5403485298156738,-1.2802280187606812,-0.24843056499958038,0.9122846126556396,0.7772694826126099,-0.06852530688047409,0.19426237046718597,-0.20525845885276794,0.2473202496767044,1.7521686553955078,-0.06471101939678192,0.11322790384292603,0.35429006814956665,-0.5628153681755066,-1.735222578048706,0.5933404564857483,-0.43202903866767883,-0.6763032674789429,1.6467900276184082,0.6824535727500916,-0.3554036021232605,-0.8283130526542664,-0.3067131042480469,0.928242027759552,0.29728588461875916,-0.6876142621040344,0.36156049370765686,0.6218625903129578,-0.667203962802887,0.045695602893829346,0.22896559536457062,-0.057835210114717484,0.43134286999702454,0.8319957852363586,-0.6149777173995972,0.8719954490661621,-0.38360804319381714,0.21841497719287872,1.18886137008667,0.4983348846435547,0.42279142141342163,-1.5201481580734253,-1.135332465171814,0.9898456335067749,-0.9781160950660706,-0.05697701871395111,0.30142080783843994,0.5212419033050537,0.2092369794845581,0.01219214592128992,1.0227117538452148,-0.09663382917642593,0.46001818776130676,-0.7759337425231934,-1.287374496459961,-0.11092396825551987,-0.2018010914325714,0.8949505686759949,-0.3193582594394684,0.32493889331817627,-0.07203784584999084,-1.3166881799697876,0.9459183812141418,-0.26025980710983276,-0.505817174911499,-0.43054336309432983,0.10115472227334976,-1.1689399480819702,0.06133674830198288,0.5921919345855713,0.11390180140733719,-0.5433851480484009,-0.9784839749336243,0.13693110644817352,0.3476877212524414,-0.9551938772201538,-0.39749857783317566,-0.9873643517494202,-1.2195788621902466,1.7333838939666748,-0.17257942259311676,0.6250112056732178,-0.12467564642429352,0.14856880903244019,0.03639255836606026,-0.687257707118988,1.4253243207931519,-0.5088247656822205,0.08826207369565964,0.72319096326828,-0.27079668641090393,-1.4903899431228638,-0.5209681391716003\CNN\Trump has common form of heart disease\2018-01-18 07:02:42.0\

Photograph: Dado Ruvic/Reuters Bitcoin’s price swings are so huge that even ransomware developers are dialling back their reliance on the currency, according to researchers at cybersecurity firm Proofpoint. Over the last quarter of 2017, researchers saw a fall of 73% in payment demands denominated in bitcoin. When demanding money to unlock a victim’s data, cybercriminals are now more likely to simply ask for a figure in US dollars, or a local currency, than specify a sum of bitcoin. Just like conventional salespeople, ransomware developers pay careful attention to the prices they charge. Some criminals offer discounts depending on the region the victim is in, offering cheaper unlocking to residents of developing nations, while others use an escalating price to encourage users to pay quickly and without overthinking things. But a rapidly oscillating bitcoin price plays havoc with those goals, Proofpoint says. “Surging cryptocurrency values are a boon for holders of bitcoin. But they are a challenge for anyone who tries to price their product or service in bitcoin — threat actors included. In Q4, newer ransomware strains appeared to take this into account. Sigma ransomware first appeared in mid-November demanding a payment denominated in US dollars.” Now, more than two thirds of ransomware strains seen in the wild denominate the payment in normal currencies. But they still demand the actual transaction be carried out in bitcoin, the researchers note. “Denominating ransoms in a government-issued currency — even if the actual payment is made in the form of bitcoin — has two big benefits for an attacker. It allows the threat actors to maintain pricing stability and still accept their payments anonymously, and in a currency that, for the moment, continues to appreciate quickly.” But with bitcoin prices now plummeting, from a high of over $19,000 in December to just over $11,000 today, there’s a chance the trend may reverse, Proofpoint notes. “No matter what happens, the correlation is more evidence of modern cybercriminals’ profit motive. They choose the tools and techniques that will best enable them to ‘follow the money.’” Bitcoin speculative bubble is bursting and has a long way to fall, economists warn Topics Bitcoin Cryptocurrencies Malware Data and computer security news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most viewed World UK Science Cities Global development Football Tech Business Environment Obituaries back to top become a supporter make a contribution securedrop ask for help advertise with us work for us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy digital newspaper archive all topics all contributors Facebook Twitter © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Now Google has stepped up its efforts, saying that it is actively removing videos portraying the potentially dangerous action. “YouTube’s community guidelines prohibit content that’s intended to encourage dangerous activities that have an inherent risk of physical harm. We work to quickly remove flagged videos that violate our policies,” said a YouTube spokesperson. YouTube will remove videos that are brought to its attention and strike the channel that uploaded it. At the time of writing, the majority of videos listed for searches for the Tide Pod challenge appeared to be commentary or satirical takes on the trend, which YouTube is allowing. Ann Marie Buerkle, acting chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, told CBS that ingesting the liquid within detergent pods could be deadly. She said: “This is what started out as a joke on the internet and now it’s just gone too far.” More than 40 calls relating to children aged 13 to 19 eating laundry detergent pods have been recorded in the US this year, with half believed to be due to intentional ingestion and many more going unreported, according to Minnesota Poison Control System. Eating the pods can cause second and third-degree burns to the nose, mouth and throat, it said. Procter & Gamble said: “We are deeply concerned about conversations related to intentional and improper use of liquid laundry pacs, and have been working with leading social media networks to remove harmful content that is not consistent with their policies. “They should not be played with, whatever the circumstance, even if meant as a joke.” The company also recruited the high-profile New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski to produce a public safety video.

I have a Microsoft Surface Pro 4, which has plenty of features I don’t need, and I hate Cortana, Edge, Xbox, Groove etc. I noticed that one of the Windows 10 tuners you reviewed last week “removes unwanted programs”. Would it work for these? Tony Every operating system includes features that some people don’t like or need. It’s even more of a problem with Google Android, which I use, so I understand the annoyance. However, on a Surface Pro 4, removing the Microsoft apps is not going to save a significant amount of space, nor is it going to make the slightest difference to performance. The time and effort you spend removing these programs will have no practical benefits, and Microsoft may well reinstall them with every operating system upgrade, which is twice a year, if not before. (Windows 10 runs an SIHClient – for Server-Initiated Healing – every day to repair any damage to the operating system.) You will therefore be committed to wasting even more time for the foreseeable future. Facebook Twitter Pinterest On a Surface Pro 4, removing the Microsoft apps is not going to save a significant amount of space. Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images Nonetheless, you can hide or remove many programs, including very old ones such as Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer 11. You can certainly remove the trial copy of Microsoft Office, which may have been pre-installed on your PC. At least that saves some space. So does removing the free games. However, you should not uninstall the Windows Store app or the Edge browser. Apps and placeholders Some Microsoft programs have tiles or appear on the Start menu. You can make them go away by right-clicking them and selecting “Uninstall” or at the very least “Unpin from Start” from the drop-down menu. If not, run the Settings app and click “Apps & features”. This lists your apps and programs and tells you how much space each is taking up. Click on a program you don’t want and you may be offered the option to uninstall it. Otherwise, Piriform’s CCleaner Free provides a simple way to remove most of the bundled apps. Run CCleaner Free and click Tools (the spanner icon) to get a list of programs. Click on Publisher to sort that column so that all the Microsoft apps are together. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Apps & features lists your apps and programs and tells you how much space each is taking up. Photograph: Windows 10 Edge The Edge browser is part of Windows 10, and its components can be used by other software to display HTML files. The EdgeHTML rendering engine is also available to third-party programs, which saves everyone from shipping their own rendering engine with every application. It should therefore save space in the long run. Removing it may well break functionality. Edge is a good browser, and worth keeping if only as a backup. It has an Adobe Flash Player and a PDF reader built in, and it’s excellent for viewing online videos. It doesn’t have as many features as its rivals, or as many extensions, but it is improving steadily. It also follows web standards. What it doesn’t do is support websites written for Internet Explorer, which is why IE11 is still included in Windows 10. Edge also forms part of Microsoft’s “intelligent assistant” system, which includes Cortana, Edge and the Bing search engine. Both Google and Apple use the same sort of architecture with their own assistants, browsers and back-ends. Cortana Cortana does two things in Windows 10. First, it runs the local search system. Second, Cortana is a cloud-based digital assistant, like the similarly cloud-based Amazon Alexa. There’s no point in removing the former, and most of the latter isn’t on your PC. What you can do is stop Cortana from gathering information about you. Run the Settings app, click the Cortana icon, and work through all the options. The section called Permissions & History includes “Change what Cortana knows about me in the cloud”. Clicking this will produce a pop-up headed “Personal Information”. Scroll to the bottom and click the button marked Clear to delete it all. Alternatively, you can go online to see and delete all the information Microsoft holds in the cloud, including Cortana. Microsoft’s help page, Cortana and privacy, provides a good guide to turning off Cortana’s information sources, if they have been turned on. Cortana can be annoying when she loads Edge to search the web, but you can avoid this. When you click in the search box, pick either Apps or Documents and avoid Web. If you go to the top and click the down-arrow next to Filters, you can restrict searches even further by selecting Emails, Music, People, Photos, Videos etc from the list. However, you can easily turn Cortana off by signing out, which is how Cortana works on Android and Apple iOS as well. Click on Cortana’s Notebook, select About Me, click on your email address and then click “Sign out”. If none of this is enough, you can disable Cortana by editing the registry in Windows 10 Home, at your own risk. See How-To Geek for details. In the Pro and Enterprise versions of Windows 10, you can enable or disable Cortana by checking the “Allow Cortana” entry in the group policy editor, which does the same thing. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cortana can be annoying when she loads Edge to search the web, but you can avoid this. Photograph: Windows 10 Programs and features As mentioned, the Settings app uninstalls programs, but it hasn’t completely replaced the old Control Panel. To run this, type “co” in the search box and run the program when it appears. The Control Panel only lists programs that run in the traditional Windows subsystem, known as Win32. It does not list new-style apps that run in the cross-platform Windows Runtime subsystem, WinRT, but check the list anyway, to see if there is anything you want to remove. After that, go to the lefthand menu and click “Turn Windows features on or off”. This pops up a box where you can add features that you might want – an FTP Server, a Telnet client, the Linux subsystem – and remove ones you don’t. Windows Media Player and IE11 appear here, though I recommend keeping both. However, if SMB 1.0 is enabled, untick it to remove it. It’s insecure and you don’t need it. Note that neither Notepad nor WordPad is mentioned in any of these lists, nor do they appear on the Start menu. Both are included in Windows 10 so that you can read documents and log files without having to download another application, and you can run them from the search box. Stop hating apps! Many users seem to dislike modern (WinRT) apps, but that doesn’t make sense. Modern apps are safer to run and easier to install and uninstall, because they don’t use the registry. They are remotely maintained without running an updater in the background, and work well with touch. Many run equally well on Intel and ARM processors. What’s not to like? If you change your mind, you can re-install Windows 10 apps from the Windows Store. You can also add apps from Microsoft and other suppliers. Potentially useful free apps include OneDrive and Dropbox Mobile, Facebook and Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Unigram (a Telegram client), Todoist, Adobe Photoshop Express, Xodo PDF Reader & Editor, Netflix, TuneIn Radio, Deezer Music, SoundByte (for SoundCloud etc), Grover Pro (for podcasts), Tubecast for YouTube, Audiobooks from Audible, Plex and Microsoft Remote Desktop. Paid-for apps include Nebo, for making handwritten notes on your Surface Pro 4, and Staffpad for writing music. Once you’ve used a few good apps, you might even get to like them … Have you got a question?

Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Apple will give users the option to turn off a feature that temporarily slows down older iPhones in order to prevent unexpected shutdowns, chief executive Tim Cook has said. The new option is likely to arrive in March, as part of the next update to iOS 11. “If you don’t want it, you can turn it off,” Cook told ABC News. The CEO maintains, however, that Apple “don’t recommend” users take advantage of the ability to disable the slowdown. Alongside the option to turn off the slowdown, Apple will also introduce much more detailed monitoring of battery health for users. Currently, iOS will warn users if their battery is substantially decayed, but will not notify them of partial ageing – even if that ageing is severe enough to warrant the slowdown. With the update, Cook said, “We’re going to give people the visibility of the health of their battery so it’s very, very transparent … this hasn’t been done before.” Before Apple released iOS 10.2.1 in 2016, older iPhones were frequently hit with an issue that caused a spontaneous shutdown if the battery’s voltage output dropped below a certain threshold – which occurred more frequently when the battery got old, cold, or ran low on charge. In that update, the company tweaked the iPhones 6, 6s and SE to instead slow down the processor when the voltage dropped. For intensive use, this resulted in the phone as a whole slowing down, but prevented it from shutting down. In 2017, with iOS 11.2, Apple made the same update to iPhone7 devices. But the company did not notify users of the change, leaving it to be discovered by individuals running performance tests on their phone. The resulting uproar saw the company accused of deliberately slowing down older devices to encourage users to buy new ones, a practice known as “planned obsolescence”.

Photograph: Danijela Froki @2016/Natural Cycles A much-hyped birth control app has been reported to Swedish authorities after a hospital found 37 cases of unwanted pregnancies among women relying on the app for contraception. Natural Cycles, a smartphone application that marries hi-tech algorithms with the old-fashioned rhythm method, last year became the first app to be certified as a contraceptive method in Europe. The app requires women to input their temperature every morning, then calculates the users’ menstrual cycle and informs them when they can have sex without protection. The Stockholm-based company, founded by Cern physicist Elina Berglund and her husband, Raoul Scherwitzl, claims to be 93% effective with typical use – and without the side-effects that many women experience from hormonal birth control. But the startup is now on the defensive after the Swedish public broadcaster SVT reported that 37 of the 668 women who sought an abortion at one of Stockholm’s largest hospitals from September to December 2017 were relying on Natural Cycles for birth control. Could an algorithm replace the pill? Read more The hospital reported the app to Sweden’s Medical Products Agency, and Natural Cycles said in a statement that it was “responding to each reported case”. “An unwanted pregnancy is, of course, very unfortunate and we deeply care every time one of our users becomes pregnant unplanned,” the company said. “As our user base increases, so will the number of unplanned pregnancies coming from Natural Cycles users. This is an arithmetic truth applicable to all contraceptive methods.” A 93% effectiveness rate means that out of every 100 women using the app, seven will experience an unwanted pregnancy. Those figures are about comparable with typical use of oral contraceptives, and better than condoms or other barrier methods, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The traditional rhythm method, which involves tracking one’s cycle without the assistance of a nuclear physicist’s algorithm, has a typical use failure rate of 24%.

Photograph: Nintendo Nintendo has introduced a new product for its Switch games console: Nintendo Labo, an innovative augmented-reality game that turns cardboard models into fully functioning toys. Inside the Nintendo Labo box are 25 sheets of thick, brown, branded cardboard, and a little cartridge that pops into a Nintendo Switch console. Following Lego-like instructions on the Switch screen, you punch out the cardboard pieces and assemble them into contraptions of varying complexity. The first project, which takes maybe 15 minutes, is a simple little bug-like radio-controlled car; slot the Joy-Con controllers into its cardboard sides, pull up the controls on the Switch’s screen, and the vibrations send it juddering across a flat surface with surprising speed. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nintendo introduces Nintendo Labo. The more complex constructions are a telescopic fishing rod with a working reel, attached to a base with elastic bands and string for realistic tension; a cardboard model of a piano with springy keys; an abstract motorbike, with handles and a pedal; a little house. Each contraption is made out of cardboard and string, and transforms into a digitally augmented toy when you slot Joy-Con controllers and the Switch screen into it. The piano, especially, is quite amazing, and takes about two hours to build. The infrared camera on the Joy-Con controller can see reflective strips of tape on the back of the keys, which come into view when a key is pressed, telling the game software to play the right note. Cardboard dials and switches modify the tone and add effects to the sound. The principles behind each construction – Toy-Cons, as Nintendo calls them – are explained by cartoon characters, putting a child-friendly spin on coding and engineering. On the Switch screen, you can view a cross-section of each model that illustrates what the Joy-Con camera can see and how it works. This educational element is geared towards curious children, but it’s also illuminating for an adult – seeing how these toys work only increases your appreciation of their ingenuity. The most complex construction, which will be sold separately, is a cardboard mech suit that transforms your entire body into a Transformers-style robot in the game, translating your punches and kicks into building-levelling virtual smashes. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nintendo Labo’s fishing game. Photograph: Hosokawa Shingo/Nintendo The finished Toy-Cons are surprisingly sturdy, but won’t stand up to extended enthusiastic play with younger kids. They do, however, dispense with the need to ever spend money on plastic accessories. Nintendo plans to offer replacement cardboard kits and templates for players who break theirs, but the easier solution is just to mend it. You can stick the cardboard Toy-Cons back together with glue or tape, reinforce them, or decorate them with pens, washi tape or googly eyes, without affecting their functionality. It’s easy to imagine creative players and the online maker community taking this customisation in unexpected directions. Nintendo Labo addresses a limitation of existing augmented reality games that use camera technology to superimpose things on the real world: however much you might want to believe that you’re battling monsters, the reality that you’re pointing a phone at a card with a weird pattern on it dents the fantasy. Drawing on Nintendo’s history as a maker of toys, the Nintendo Labo creations are tangible physical objects, enhanced rather than conjured by the games console. It invites players to engage intellectually and creatively with the technology, and the careful process of building them makes for a more mindful toy than most digital entertainment, which will appeal to parents trying to moderate their kids’ screen time. Nintendo of Europe’s president, Satoru Shibata, gave a statement: “Our goal is to put smiles on the faces of everyone Nintendo touches. Nintendo Labo invites anyone with a creative mind and a playful heart to make, play and discover in new ways with Nintendo Switch. I personally hope to see many people enjoying making kits with their family members, with big smiles on their faces.” Nintendo Labo will be released 27 April in Europe, 20 April in the US.

It failed to make the shortlist. Photograph: Brynn Anderson/AP Amazon seeks prime North American spot for second headquarters Read more Amazon released a list of 20 cities on Thursday which it is considering for its second headquarters, including established technology hubs like Boston and Pittsburgh as well as more surprising choices such as Columbus, Ohio. The tech company has whittled down its shortlist after a sometimes bizarre bidding process that involved 238 communities across the US, Canada and Mexico. Only one city outside the US, Toronto, has made the cut. Amazon has claimed its new $5bn headquarters will create 50,000 new jobs and the prospect of securing its favour set off an aggressive charm offensive with cities offering huge tax breaks and even sending gifts, including a giant cactus, to attract the company’s attention. Calgary in Canada offered to change its name to Calmazon or Amagary if it won and a local business group offered to fight a bear to win Amazon’s approval. It did not make the list.

Thank you for your feedback. Candidates were asked to give Amazon details of the cities’ education and crime statistics as well as cultural attractions, transport infrastructure and recreational opportunities. The company also asked states to describe the tax incentives it expects them to provide in order to win its favor. New Jersey officials have offered $7bn in tax incentives if Newark, a financially struggling city, should win. It has made the list. Michigan also promised generous tax breaks and to spend $120m on childcare, educational and other programs to the company to bring it to Detroit. It did not make the list. But the bidding process has also attracted criticism from civic groups. In an open letter to Amazon’s founder and chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, 73 civic leaders asked the company to promise quid pro quo for taxpayer support. “You have your list of things you’re looking for from cities – but we live in these cities, and we’ve got some expectations of our own for Amazon,” the authors wrote. “We love jobs, we love technology, and we love convenience – but what you’re looking for will impact every part of our cities. We built these cities, and we want to make sure they remain ours.” Topics Amazon news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most viewed World UK Science Cities Global development Football Tech Business Environment Obituaries back to top become a supporter make a contribution securedrop ask for help advertise with us work for us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy digital newspaper archive all topics all contributors Facebook Twitter © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Robin Roemer YouTube changed Erin Armstrong’s life. The transgender vlogger joined in 2006, posting videos about her transition and connecting with trans people across the globe, building a community that once seemed unimaginable to her. But last year, the Google-owned video platform started flagging some of her videos as unsuitable to advertisers, costing her much-needed revenue – and this week, the site emailed her even more hurtful news: her channel is now considered too small to be eligible for ads, and under new rules, she will be kicked out of YouTube’s partner program altogether. Logan Paul: YouTube reprimands star vlogger over Japan 'suicide forest' video Read more “I’m done trying to make content that is going to fit these guidelines, and I’m done being nickeled and dimed constantly,” said Armstrong, a 33-year-old Oakland, California, resident. “They really cater to the people who have the money, the views and the pull, and it’s less about creating and supporting the small communities that come together and share their experiences.” The new rules came just following YouTube’s decision to allow the popular vlogger Logan Paul to continue to monetize his videos even after he broadcasted an apparent suicide victim’s body. YouTube’s reforms this week are meant to tighten restrictions on ads in the wake of the scandal. But some see a double standard and fear the new policies could further harm vloggers with smaller audiences and artists who seek ad revenue to support their work. Creators who discuss mental health, disability and LGBT topics in particular have argued that YouTube is failing them, while rewarding creators who produce offensive content. Erin Armstrong. Photograph: Handout YouTube, which denies that its systems are biased, has been on the defense for months, accused of spreading misinformation, footage harmful to children, harassing content and other damaging videos. Paul, a 22-year-old celebrity YouTuber with 15 million subscribers, apologized this month after millions watched his video showing a dead body. It took 10 days for YouTube to respond to the backlash about the video, which remained on the site until Paul took it down. The company announced last week that his channel would be removed from a premium advertising program and that partnership projects were being placed on hold. But Paul, who is known for viral pranks, is still eligible to earn money through YouTube’s general ad program. This is in contrast to vloggers who said it seemed that YouTube’s system was automatically deeming them unsuitable to advertisers simply because of their identities, and placing the burden on them to appeal their case. The comedian Gaby Dunn said YouTube’s system often seemed to flag her LGBT content as “not suitable for all advertisers”, but did not restrict sketches depicting straight couples. “It really gives a big middle finger to what YouTube is supposed to be,” said Dunn, who is bisexual, alleging that sketches in which she makes out with men and appears in her underwear were deemed ad-friendly while videos where she kisses women or discusses queer dating were restricted. Dunn said YouTube’s ad policies had hurt “the ones who need to be monetized most” – people with specific fanbases, such as trans and nonbinary people or those who discuss mental illnesses or disabilities. “It’s turning YouTube into a mirror of traditional media, which it tries to say that it’s not.” A YouTube spokesperson said in a statement: “YouTube has long supported LGBTQ creators and we do not have any policies or LGBT related words that trigger demonetization,” adding: “Sometimes our systems get it wrong, which is why we’ve encouraged creators to appeal.” The spokesperson said that Dunn’s videos that had been flagged were only partially demonetized from certain advertisers and said that two videos were fixed this week after a review prompted by the Guardian’s inquiry. Armstrong, however, said her ad revenue had dropped from about $180 a month at its peak to as little as $30, eventually leading her to give up her efforts to monetize her channel. On Tuesday, YouTube said her channel would “lose access to all monetization tools”. YouTube wrote in a blogpost that it would “better protect creators” and stop “bad actors” by raising standards for ad eligibility, requiring channels to have 4,000 hours of views within the past year and 1,000 subscribers. YouTube to manually review popular videos before placing ads Read more Armstrong has nearly 12,000 subscribers, but only about 3,400 hours of views in 12 months, meaning she is being kicked out of the ad program. “It feels like I’m getting punished for other people’s mistakes,” she said, adding that the changes encouraged “shock and awe” videos and not the authentic LGBT content that can help people struggling with their identities. YouTube claimed that 99% of channels that would be demonetized under the new policy were already making less than $100 a year. This week’s reforms, which also include new requirements for human reviews of popular channels, would not have stopped Paul’s dead body video. Kackie Condatore, a Texas-based YouTuber who vlogs about cosmetology and has 2,000 subscribers, said she had been frustrated that her videos about body positivity, her health struggles, birth control and other serious topics have been deemed unsuitable for ads. Noting that her makeup videos have been monetized, but mental health discussions are flagged, she said: “It does feel like YouTube makes a point to discourage that kind of content.” Lily Harvey, a British vlogger who discusses mental health, said her content was meant to help people and that it was upsetting to see YouTube demonetize those videos while appearing to continue to support Paul: “They make a lot of money from him. They are a business at the end of the day, and that’s how they think.” Topics YouTube Google Social media news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most viewed World UK Science Cities Global development Football Tech Business Environment Obituaries back to top become a supporter make a contribution securedrop ask for help advertise with us work for us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy digital newspaper archive all topics all contributors Facebook Twitter © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images Bitcoin has all the hallmarks of a classic speculative bubble and even after almost halving in value in a matter of weeks it still has further to fall, according to a leading team of economists. As regulators in South Korea again signalled on Thursday that they were considering a ban on cryptocurrency exchanges, Capital Economics also dismissed claims that bitcoin and its imitators could replace established currencies as “rubbish”. Bitcoin, which rose to more than $19,000 in December, recovered by 18% on Thursday after suffering heavy losses in the preceding two days. Its value was sitting at $11,560 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange shortly after 2am GMT. Other cryptocurrencies include Ethereum and Ripple. Q&A What is bitcoin and is it a bad investment? Show Hide Bitcoin is the first, and the biggest, "cryptocurrency" – a decentralised tradable digital asset. Whether it is a bad investment is the big question. Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption – or regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. The currency’s volatility has alarmed regulators around the world and suggestions that it could be banned triggered the latest falls. Capital’s research note says the latest price falls “suggest that the bubble is bursting” although because the price was still ten times higher than it was a year ago, it still had a long way to fall. Part of the problem, Capital says, is that despite the claims that cryptocurrencies could replace dollars and pounds one day, the surge in the price was not being driven by any strategic world view but more a simple belief that they will continue to rise in value. “Most people are buying Bitcoin, not because of a belief in its future as a global currency, but because they expect it to rise in value,” the note says. “Accordingly, it has all the hallmarks of a classic speculative bubble, which we expect to burst. Triggers for the bubble to burst could be a further crackdown by regulators or a major hacking attempt. “When it will fully burst is anyone’s guess and prices could yet rise again, before they fall further ahead,” they added. The Capital team, led by London-based Vicky Redwood and Kerrie Walsh, argue that even if the bubble does burst it should not have too great an impact on the global economy because the amount of money invested in cryptocurrencies is still relatively small and they are not held by institutions. In South Korea, which accounts for up to 15% of daily Bitcoin trading, the chief financial regulator chief told MPs in Seoul on Thursday that the government was considering shutting down all local virtual currency exchanges, days after the idea was raised by the country’s justice minister. “The government is considering both shutting down all local virtual currency exchanges or just the ones who have been violating the law,” said Choi Jong-ku, chief of financial services commission. The Russian and Chinese governments have also hinted at similar moves. However, even if trading in the currencies is outlawed, Capital acknowledges that the blockchain technology behind the phenomenon will have a lasting impact. “Not only could it transform the financial system – by removing the need for banks to act as intermediaries – but it could have applications elsewhere, for example, in maintaining tax and hospital records. A particularly interesting element is smart contracts, which could transform supply chains and trade finance.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.

Apple secretly moved parts of empire to Jersey after row over tax affairs Read more The company, which has faced international criticism for its tax evasion policies, also said it would spend $30bn in the US over the next five years, creating 20,000 new jobs. Lawmakers in the US, European Union and the UK have criticized Apple over its tax policies. The company holds $246bn in low-tax countries. During the election campaign, Donald Trump attacked Apple’s policy of building its phones, tablets and other gadgets overseas. In June, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Apple’s chief executive officer, Tim Cook, had promised to build three “big, big, big” plants in the US as part of a discussion about tax reform. The company is the latest to announce a one-off payment as a result of recent changes to US tax law, which allows companies to pay a levy of 15.5% on overseas cash holdings that are repatriated to the US. Commenting on the company’s plans, Cook said: “We have a deep sense of responsibility to give back to our country and the people who help make our success possible.” Apple has not specified how much of its cash pile it intends to repatriate. In 2013, a Senate committee accused Apple of using a “highly questionable” web of offshore vehicles to avoid paying taxes in the US. Senator John McCain said his constituents were “mad as hell” to learn that the world’s biggest company was paying tax rates that were sometimes lower than 1%. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” he said. According to the Paradise Papers, a leak of 13.4m files from offshore service providers and tax havens’ company registries published by the Guardian and other international media, in the wake of the US and EU’s criticisms Apple secretly shifted parts of its empire to Jersey as part of a complex rearrangement to keep its low tax rates. In December, the Irish government was forced to start collecting $15bn that the European Union says Apple has unfairly avoided in taxes. Apple is fighting the decision.

Photograph: Kohler The annual trend-setting tech extravaganza that is CES International in Las Vegas is drawing to a close, having suffered through torrential rain, blackouts and a few uncooperative robots. And it’s clear that your voice is more important than ever. CES 2018 rammed home that big technology thinks voice is the next major evolution in computing. First we had the computer, then the smartphone and now voice assistants. Smart speakers such as Amazon’s popular Echo devices and Google’s Home, which both had a killer Christmas, are just one outlet for the artificial intelligence-powered voice assistant. Google reverse-ferreted from its Google own-brand strategy to follow Amazon’s lead in opening up its Assistant voice system to third-parties. Manufacturers from all ends of the scale, from the high-end Danish firm Bang & Olufsen to the cheap and cheerful Anker, fired out announcements of new smart speakers. Some, such as LG, also launched so called smart displays with Google Assistant – a direct shot at Amazon’s Echo Show smart speaker with a screen. Facebook Twitter Pinterest An employee demonstrates home appliances that can be controlled by Amazon Alexa at the LG booth during CES. Photograph: John Locher/AP But while Google’s battle strategy for the home was clearly to catch up with Amazon, the market leader’s CES was quite different. Its Alexa voice assistant cropped up in things as diverse as showers, mirrors, light switches, microwave ovens and cars, clearly freed from the confines of speaker-like things – no matter whether or not anyone actually wants a voice-controlled shower. Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said: “Google, Amazon, Microsoft and others are fighting not only to cement their voice technologies, but also to ensure their assistant platforms are deeply embedded across the full spectrum of consumer electronics to maintain and deepen consumer engagement.” “Based on what we’ve seen so far, there’s no question that Amazon’s Alexa continues to lead the charge when it comes to voice assistant integration.” One place Alexa and Google have notably lost out is Mercedes cars. The German automotive power house unveiled a new “Hey Mercedes” system for voice-control system for its cars, deciding to go it alone in a move Geoff Blaber from CCS Insight called “perplexing”. “Just as most of the industry is recognising the need to integrate technology and improve time to market through collaboration, partnerships and open platforms, Mercedes is deciding to reinvent the wheel with an entirely proprietary approach,” said Blaber. Smart home overload Facebook Twitter Pinterest As if voice-enabled everything wasn’t enough, the show floors were filled with a bewildering array of smart home gadgets vying for consumer cash. Smart speakers have reignited interest in the smart home market, acting as a central hub and therefore a gateway drug to smart everything, although mainly lightbulbs until now. Some “smart” things, such as the leak detection devices showcased at CES, appear to make sense, simply by alerting you to issues about your home that might dent the bank account if not dealt with immediately. Others, such as Kohler’s $6,000 Numi smart toilet, not so much. It’s voice-activated, has mood lighting, a heated seat, foot warmer and advanced bidet functionality with air dryer. Lovely. “I pity the poor consumer,” said Wood. “The smart home now has such a bewildering set of choices it is virtually impossible to figure out what is the best solution.” Flying taxis and light-up drones Intel (@intel) Get a closer look at the #Volocopter, the Intel-powered autonomous air taxi that took flight at #CES2018 pic.twitter.com/XQUhIxx6cQ January 11, 2018 So far so not-so-future, until the drones showed up. Intel set the drone agenda by flying its 18-rotor, two-person Volocopter taxi drone on stage at its opening keynote. It then lit up the famous Bellagio fountains on the Las Vegas strip with 250 of its Shooting Star drones, performing a lightshow coordinated to Kygo’s Stargazing. Where there were drones there were also companies exhibiting anti-drone solutions, from radar tracking and signal jamming to more aggressive tactics, all promising to “bring it down”. Analysts may be sceptical about consumer drones surviving as a mainstream item. But excitement still remains around flying taxis, even though SureFly’s demos of its $200,000 two-person diesel-electric hybrid drone were thwarted by what was reported as “mild drizzle”. Passenger drone flights in the UK might be a while. Computer says no Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cloi stopped responding to LG’s vice president of marketing as he tried to show off the company’s new toy. Photograph: David Becker/Getty Images But if CES 2018 was to be remembered for anything, it’ll be for non-compliant robots. LG showed off its Cloi home-helping robot that was meant to act as an interface between you and the mundane things in your life such as the washer dryer or the oven. Sadly, minutes into the live demo Cloi stopped responding to LG’s vice president of marketing David VanderWaal creating an embarrassing one-way conversation as he tried to elicit a response. “The episode proved to be an apt metaphor for a lot of the technology on show at CES this year, particularly in the area of consumer robotics,” said Wood. “It seemed like many of the devices on show weren’t quite ready for primetime.” That even extended to the show itself, which, due to heavy rainfall, suffered a blackout mid-exhibit leaving attendees under emergency lighting for three hours.

Ludo wonders if he should keep paying for commercial clean-up program to run in Windows 10. Fortunately there are free alternative suites Jack Schofield Thu 11 Jan 2018 11.47 GMT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Windows 10 already includes a disk clean-up program and an add/remove programs utility, plus some monitoring and disk defragmentation routines. Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images Do I still need paid-for software like ParetoLogic’s PC Health Advisor with Windows 10 Pro? Ludo Short answer: no. Tune-up programs enjoyed some success in the boom years from Windows 95 to XP, when hardware was slower and optimisation might make a difference. Today, Windows 10 looks after itself pretty well, and the simplest “tune up” is to go to the Recovery section of the Settings app and choose “Reset this PC”. Another option is to restore from a back-up made before any problems appeared. Windows 10 already includes a disk clean-up program and an add/remove programs utility, plus some monitoring and disk defragmentation routines. Its new Task Manager provides a simple way to control what your PC loads at start-up. The main things it lacks are a registry cleaner and a way to check third-party programs to see if they need updating. However, I’ve never seen any evidence that registry cleaners provide benefits, and they can be harmful. Also, many third-party programs have their own update systems. This is the case in the area where it really matters: browsers. Tune-up and optimisation programs could still be useful, because they provide a lot of tools in one handy package. The problem is that they can find hundreds or even thousands of “errors” and then ask for money to complete the clean-up. This kind of marketing puts people off the whole category, and as a result, even reputable programs suffer. ParetoLogic’s PC Health Advisor may be a reputable product – I’ve never used it – but you don’t really need it, and you don’t need to pay $50 a year (or whatever) for a clean-up program. If you want one, Piraform’s CCleaner Free does the job well enough for most people. Otherwise, my current preference is to download specific tools only when you need them. When downloading any freeware, always watch out for unwanted “foistware” that may be bundled with the program you want. Tune-up suites Facebook Twitter Pinterest CCleaner Free. Photograph: C Cleaner I’ve been recommending CCleaner for around a decade, so it has stood the test of time. The free version does a good job clearing out temporary files, log files, cookies, memory dumps and so on. (You can unselect things you want to keep.) It also includes a non-aggressive registry cleaner, which I tried just to see what it did. It didn’t produce any noticeable improvements, but at least it didn’t do any harm. CCleaner also includes a disk analyser, a duplicate file finder, and a drive wiper. It can also uninstall other software. Of course, Piriform would like you upgrade to its paid-for Professional and Professional Plus editions. The Professional Plus version includes another three Piriform programs: Defraggler disk defragmentation software, the Recuva file recovery program, and Speccy, which provides a very good inventory of your PC hardware and peripherals. However, you can download free versions of all three separately. Last July, Piriform, a small British company, was bought by Avast, the anti-virus software giant that also owns AVG. In August, CCleaner v5.33 was comprised on 32-bit PCs and malware was inserted into the installer. According to Avast, this was a targeted attack aimed at a dozen technology companies, and the malware was downloaded to only 40 known computers, or 0.0018% of the PCs running the compromised CCleaner. Piriform obviously replaced the compromised version of its software, but it prompted some users to try other products, such as Glarysoft’s Glary Utilities 5.91. This has at least 30 functions. As well as the usual ones, it includes a memory optimiser, a disk space analyser, a file encrypter, a file splitter/joiner, system backup and restore, registry backup and restore, and a fast file finder. I’ve not really used Glary Utilities – I installed it yesterday just to check it out – but it seems to work well enough to compete with CCleaner. It didn’t install an isearch.glarysoft.com redirect, or a toolbar, and it has a good rating on the trustworthy Major Geeks site. (Annoyingly, it requires a reboot when you uninstall it.) Pick the best Facebook Twitter Pinterest Glary Utilities. Photograph: Glary Clean-up suites are convenient but they don’t give you the flexibility, range of choice or, sometimes, the power of standalone utilities. It’s generally worth downloading at least a couple of these, trying them, and uninstalling the ones you don’t like. In this market, personal preference counts for a lot. I’ve already devoted two answers to some of the most popular and/or most useful utilities, so read Which programs should I install when setting up Windows 10? and Which Windows programs for more advanced users do you recommend? There are also lots of good suggestions in the comments. Standalone programs such as Revo Uninstaller, Search Everything, 7-Zip, SiSoftware’s Sandra Lite analyser, CrystalDiskInfo, Auslogic’s Disk Defrag Free, Heidi’s Eraser and the Macrium Reflect Free backup program are all better than anything I’ve noticed in suite form. Views will differ more markedly when it comes to disk space analysers and duplicate file finders, though currently my votes go to Splashsoft’s RidNacs and BigBang’s DoubleKiller. They are not the prettiest but they do the job. Either way, the crowd-sourced AlternativeTo web site will suggest more than enough alternatives. Software updates The most important utility missing from Windows 10 and many clean-up/tune-up suites is a program that checks whether software is up to date. Nowadays, most security holes are in third-party programs such as Adobe Reader, Flash, Oracle Java, Apple iTunes and so on. Your PC may be running code from dozens of suppliers, and you probably don’t know which programs needed security patches. Even if you did, it would take ages to update them all separately. Some anti-virus vendors have stepped into the breach. For example, Avast includes a utility to update third-party software, and Kaspersky has released its free Software Updater as a standalone utility. However, I still prefer Secunia’s Personal Software Inspector, which is now owned by Flexera. It can usually install updates automatically, it finds programs that Kaspersky ignores, it gives you a percentage score (gamifying updates) and keeps a historical record... though without the nice graphs provided in the old version. Flexera does ask for your name and email address, but its marketing emails have an unsubscribe button. Have you got a question?

Annabelle has been using an Apple iPod Shuffle but the battery is going. Is there a cheap and suitable music player she should replace it with? Jack Schofield Thu 4 Jan 2018 11.46 GMT Last modified on Thu 4 Jan 2018 11.48 GMT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close ‘Does anybody out there know of any lightweight, blind-accessible alternatives to the iPod Shuffle?’ Photograph: Alamy xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> I am a blind young woman who absolutely loves listening to music. Does anybody out there know of any lightweight, blind-accessible alternatives to the iPod Shuffle? I have a first-generation Shuffle, which I purchased in 2008, and the battery dies after one hour. I want something that can be compatible with iTunes Music, especially .m4a files, that can store lots of music, and most important of all, that has an easy way to replace the battery. Also, I don’t want it to be too spendy, as right this moment, I don’t have hundreds of dollars. Annabelle Apple has discontinued the iPod Shuffle, but there are still lots of them available from other sources. Many are advertised as being brand new and still sealed in their boxes. Your simplest and least disruptive option is to buy a more recent Shuffle, or two, either “as new” or little used. Given that your last Shuffle lasted around nine years, this should also be a reasonably cost-effective option. Alternatively, you could get someone to replace the battery in your current Shuffle. Unfortunately, iFixit says this is “very difficult” with a first-generation version, so I don’t recommend it in your case. However, iFixit also shows how to replace the batteries in later versions of the Shuffle, and this could influence your choice of a new model. Replacement iPod batteries often ship with the small tools required, and there are usually demonstration videos on YouTube. You may have a friend who is happy to do this for you, should the need arise, or a local repair shop that can do it cheaply. Consider an iPod Touch The iPod Touch is the only surviving member of the iPod family, and it’s much like an iPhone without the phone. You might dismiss it for being a touchscreen player or, more likely, because it’s expensive at £199/£299 or $199/$299. However, it does have a number of features that may make it usable by blind and visually impaired users. These include the VoiceOver screen reader and Voice Control, which recognises command such as shuffle, pause and next song. See Apple’s help page, Use Accessibility features on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. Better still, the latest iPod Touch has Siri, Apple’s voice-controlled digital assistant. Experiment with Siri on an iPad or iPhone to find out if you can operate an iPod Touch successfully. A new iPod Touch may be a bit spendy at the moment, but you may be able to afford a second hand or refurbished one. Either way, as an iTunes user, sticking with Apple is the simplest way to maintain your current set-up. MP3 players for blind users You would think there would be a huge market for cheap, easy-to-use MP3 players suitable for blind and visually impaired users, and for older users whose fingers are not as nimble as they used to be. If there is, suppliers don’t appear to be addressing it. There are products such as the Victor Reader Stream, which is a Daisy-compatible talking book and media player, and the Plextalk Pocket Daisy player, but they generally cost £300 [$300] to £400 [$400] or more. (Daisy is an acronym for Digital Accessible Information Systems, and it’s an international standard for audio publications such as “talking books”.) In the UK, the RNIB sells Sovereign and Sonic portable USB players that enable blind users to play music from flash drives. But they have built-in loudspeakers so they’re not as portable as a Shuffle or similar MP3 player. The affordable alternatives are mostly MP3 players that target the gym bunny and exercise markets, which probably includes the Shuffle. People who are doing physically strenuous things don’t have time to look at tiny screens or mess about with complicated interfaces. The SanDisk (Sansa) Clip Sport and Clip Jam are among the most popular examples, but both have screens. However, there are a few that don’t. Have a look at the AGPTEK G02 and the Philips GoGear SoundDot and FitDot, for example. (The original Creative Zen Stone is long gone.) Facebook Twitter Pinterest It might be a decade old, but the iPod Shuffle is still a great asset to visually impaired listeners. Photograph: Cate Gillon/Getty Images Some MP3 players are designed for swimmers. Examples include the waterproof Sigomatech swimming MP3 player, the AGPTEK S12 and the Exeze Rider. There are also “head hugging” all-in-one MP3 players/headphones such as the Sony NWZ W273A (discontinued) and the (current) NW-WS413 and NW-WS414 Sports Walkman models, for general exercise including swimming. I haven’t used any of the exercise-oriented MP3 players, so you will have to read some reviews to see if there’s one you think might work for you. Based on Amazon reviews, the 8GB AGPTEK G02 looks a good bet at £17.99/$19.99 except that it only supports MP3, Microsoft WMA (Windows Media Audio) and WAV files, not Apple’s AAC files. This is a problem with many cheap players, and it may not change in a hurry because MP3 is now licence-free (the Fraunhofer Institute’s patents expired) whereas AAC still requires fees. You can convert AAC files to MP3 in iTunes but it might be a lot of work and it won’t improve the sound quality. Note also that non-Apple players will not play old music files that have Apple’s DRM (Digital Rights Management) copy protection, ie m4p rather than m4a. You could either upgrade them via iTunes or, if there are not too many of them, burn them to CD and re-rip them. A note on Rockbox One of the geekier options is to install the open source Rockbox software to improve or replace the operating software in a compatible MP3 player. Only a small number of – usually, older – players are compatible, but this does include many SanDisk models, as well as Cowon, Philips, Samsung, Sony and other players. The benefit is that Rockbox provides support for blind and visually impaired users, including voiced menus. Rockbox has an FAQ and an index page for blind users. The major drawback for you is that Rockbox doesn’t work with iTunes. (It has its own database system.) Also, I expect someone would have to install Rockbox for you. If so, you should both read the installation instructions very carefully before buying a player. Alternatives to iTunes Most people only use iTunes to manage music on iOS devices, though DoubleTwist provides a useful way to sync Android devices. However, most MP3 players now plug into a USB port, where they appear as external hard drives. That means you can simply drag-and-drop music folders to your player. (This is the same as setting an iPod to “Manually manage music and videos”, which also avoids importing files into iTunes’ library.) Unfortunately, that still leaves you with the problem of finding an accessible MP3 player that supports AAC or making MP3 versions of all your music. If you have a Mac running MacOS 10.10 or later, you could use Doug’s Convert and Export script or M3Unify to create MP3 copies in a separate folder or on an SD card or USB drive, then copy them to your MP3 player. For Windows users, the alternatives to iTunes include MusicBee, MediaMonkey (which also syncs with iPods) and Foobar2000 (which supports LAME). Windows users may be willing to put some effort into escaping from iTunes, especially as there are now so many alternative sources of music, including Amazon. However, I think you’d be better off sticking with iTunes and iPod Shuffle for as long as they are viable, while thinking about an iPod Touch when funds are available. Have you got a question?

It is a family computer but I also use it for work, for processing photos that I take professionally, and creating photobooks. Otherwise, my husband has 333GB of music, and we have also have email and web-surfing needs. I’m looking to spend £800-ish. Please help, it’s a minefield out there. Sam Buying a new desktop PC is one of today’s simpler computer problems. The main decisions are about size, speed, source and price, though not necessarily in that order. There aren’t any tough technology decisions, because we already know the best options. The main barrier is the ability, or willingness, to pay for them. Size boils down to big or small. For a home-office machine, bigger is better. A tower system has more space for expansion, is easier to repair, and can use hotter, faster chips. You may not anticipate adding more memory, a second hard drive or a graphics card, but it’s great to have the option. Speed will be as fast as you can afford, partly because a fast PC is likely to last longer, and changing to a new PC is not many people’s idea of a fun night in. This year, the standard processor for your purposes has been the Intel Core i5-7400, which offers the best performance in your price range, though eighth-gen chips are arriving now. Users who want to spend less can drop down to a Core i3-7100 or an Intel Pentium G4560, both of which are fast relative to their prices. But don’t try to save money on memory: 8GB is the minimum for a decent desktop. When it comes to sourcing a new machine, UK users have two main options. They can buy from one of the big desktop PC suppliers – such as Dell, HP and Lenovo – or one of the smaller British companies, such as Chillblast, PC Specialist, Scan and Novatech. For more information, see my earlier answer, Should I buy my next desktop PC from a UK company? I assume you bought your old Dell online. However, if your need is very urgent, then you may have to visit a computer store, or a retailer such as John Lewis or Currys PC World. Many shops now sell both “family” and gaming desktops. Buying online should provide more configuration options, and better support deals. Sadly, Dell and HP have reduced the number of options on “normal” machines, so you can’t easily add extra memory or swap the DVD for a Blu-ray drive or upgrade the graphics card. If you want more choice, you may have to buy a games-oriented PC, such as a Dell Aurora, HP Omen or Lenovo Y520. If not, you may as well buy in a store, though you will miss out on any online promotions, coupons etc. Possible choices Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lenovo desktop Photograph: Lenovo If you decide to buy from Dell online, the best value option is the Inspiron 3668 desktop. At the time of writing, this gets you a Core i5-7400 with 8GB of memory, an Nvidia GeForce GT 1030 graphics card with 2GB of memory, 128GB of SSD storage and a 1TB hard drive for £649 including delivery. That’s under budget, so you could consider adding three years of Premium Plus onsite service for £122.25. Dell also sells an Inspiron 3268 desktop in a smaller tower. This has a Core i3-7100 with 8GB of memory and a 1TB hard drive for £449, but you lose the SSD, the graphics card and some expandability. Upgrading to a Core i5-7400 pushes the price up to £549, which is poor value compared to the bigger 3668. Currys PC World has a lot of desktops within your price range. For example, you could get an HP Pavilion 570-p058na with a Core i5-7400, 8GB of memory, an AMD Radeon R5 435 graphics card, 128GB of SSD storage and a 3TB hard drive for £649 – the same price as the Inspiron 3668. This is a pretty well balanced system for your purposes. The graphics card is the weakest link, even compared to a GeForce GT-1030, but you won’t be using your PC for gaming. Lenovo’s £649.99 offering is the Ideacentre 510-15IKL. This has a 2TB instead of a 3TB hard drive and no graphics card at all. The Pavilion looks like the best deal, but shop around to see if you can find one with a better graphics card, or buy a machine where you can add one yourself. Dell hell ... I took an unusual interest in Sam’s query because we are both into processing photos and creating photobooks, though I also do a bit of simple video editing. While she had a seven-year-old Dell that had died, I had a six-year-old Dell that was still going strong, but showing its age. Also, £800 is my sort of price. Researching her query might also answer mine. I knocked up a small spreadsheet to compare the various specifications including less obvious ones, such as the number of USB 3 ports, the number of memory slots and free drive bays, and the size of the power supply. Dell has a lot of desktop brands for different markets including Inspiron, XPS, Vostro, OptiPlex and Aurora, and it’s hard to find the details. The secret is to use the online comparison feature, which does lay out the specs, albeit they’re not wholly consistent between machines. In the end, of course, my deliberations counted for naught. Dell offered the £899 XPS desktop for £699 on Black Friday, and which of us can resist a bargain? PC progress This is my third Dell desktop in a row. In April 2005 I bought a Dimension 8400 with a 3GHz Intel Pentium 4 processor, a massive 1GB of memory, a 160GB hard drive, an LCD screen and 32-bit Windows XP Pro SP2. It cost me £1,090.17 (£1,147.74 including delivery), which seemed cheap at the time. Well, it was packed with new technology including a “hyperthreading” processor, PCi Express graphics, a SATA hard drive, and a DVD instead of a CD-Rom drive. See: The art of buying a desktop. That machine ran very happily for six years, thanks to a memory upgrade and a new graphics card, the original being feeble. I replaced it in September 2011 with a Dell Vostro 460 MT running Windows 7 on a 3.3GHz Core i5-2500. This processor was a huge step forward, and it’s still pretty good. It’s faster than current chips such as Intel’s Core i7-8550U and Core i5-8350U, the difference being that they are 15W chips for thin laptops, where the i5-2500 is a 95W monster with a stonking great fan. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dell of a bargain? Dell offered the £899 XPS desktop for £699 on Black Friday. Photograph: Elise Amendola/AP My Vostro 460 MT had 4GB of RAM, a GeForce GT 420 with its own gigabyte of memory, a 1TB hard drive, DVD, and 64-bit Windows 7 Pro for only £670.80. It still feels like a bargain, and could probably last another two or three years. But it has already been treated to an extra 8GB of memory and a new hard drive, because the original failed. It could do with a new graphics card and an SSD, and its lack of any USB 3 ports makes copying very slow. Does it make sense to keep investing in an old war-horse when the money could go towards a faster and much quieter PC? No. So, my latest Dell is an XPS 8930 with a six-core 2.8GHz i5-8400, 8GB of RAM, a GeForce GTX 1050Ti with 4GB of graphics memory, a 1TB hard drive accelerated with 16GB of Optane memory, a DVD drive and Microsoft Windows 10. The total came to £727.76. The big difference is the speed of the processor, which has a PassMark score of 11,703. For comparison, the i5-2500 scored 6,303 and the Pentium 4 only 489, despite them all having much the same clock speed. Hard drives have got so big I no longer care: I only half filled the last one. And desktop PC prices are still very reasonable, especially if you amortise the cost over six years, 312 weeks, or maybe 15,000 hours. Have you got a question?

Sara wants some new headphones but there are lots to choose from. How should she go about finding a new pair? Jack Schofield Thu 21 Dec 2017 11.56 GMT Last modified on Thu 21 Dec 2017 12.33 GMT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close ‘I want to buy a new pair of headphones … How can some of them cost hundreds of dollars?’ Photograph: Alamy xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> I want to buy a new pair of headphones. I’ve had a pair of Sony headphones for years that sound great and cost me $45 (£33.64). How can some headphones cost hundreds of dollars? Also, are wireless/Bluetooth headphones any good? Sara Headphones, like most technology products, are subject to the law of diminishing returns. Most cost from about £25 to £350, but you can pay more than $50,000 for a pair of Sennheiser Orpheus headphones, or €100,000 for the bejewelled bling of Focal Utopia headphones by Tournaire. Starting at the low end, you can usually get better sound quality by paying a bit more, and there are lots of good options in the £100-£300 range. Beyond that, you may have to pay a lot more to get marginal improvements. The best strategy is to quit when you can’t hear a significant difference between the best ones you’ve heard and any more expensive model. Alternatively, quit when you reach your budget limit. The obvious problem is that you have to listen to headphones to find the ones you like best. For high-end shoppers, this may mean visiting specialist shops, hi-fi exhibitions and ultimately the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Which I did. Educated auditions A proper headphone test would involve trying different headphones with the same source material under the same conditions, and checking your impressions against headphone frequency response graphs. “Same conditions” means “same volume level” because louder usually sounds better. So you’re not going to do a proper test. However, you can compare new headphones with your current ones, using a good quality source: an MP3 player or smartphone with a few high-quality sound files that you know well. That eliminates some of the variables. Which sound files? Pick something you like that includes a mixture of voices and instruments, including low bass notes and high trebles. Examples include the Eagles’ Hotel California and two Pink Floyd songs, Time and Money (including the chat at the end). Also try to include a live music track. Singer-songwriters have their uses, as do piano trios and string quartets. Live acoustic recordings make great headphone tests. Try to avoid asking yourself if something “sounds good”: the brain is adept at picking up audio clues and filling in things you can’t hear (see psychoacoustics). Instead, listen for details. How clearly can you distinguish different instruments? Does a guitar/piano/flute/etc sound like a guitar/piano/flute/etc in real life? Are the different instruments clearly separated in space, and are their positions stable? Better quality headphones reveal more detail. If you are trading up, you should expect to hear things you’ve not heard or noticed before. Sometimes you can hear too much detail, including bad edits on recordings. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Want the perfect song to test out your potential new headphones? Look no further than the Eagles’ Hotel California. Photograph: RB/Redferns Ask yourself if there’s a good balance between bass, mid-range and treble. Some people prefer a bass boost, but too much becomes a bad thing. A boosted treble can reveal more detail but sibilance is too much of a good thing, and quickly becomes fatiguing. And the most important thing: do the headphones sound “musical”? Are your feet tapping? Despite your attempt to be analytical, have you been seduced into enjoying the music? Some hi-fi products do that, even though they may not have the best tech specs or the best lab test results. Those are the ones to buy. Incidentally, most people can learn how to listen better. Harman’s How to Listen (for MacOS and Windows) is a good starting point. Pro Audio Essentials offers a gamified way to start developing the listening skills you’d need in a recording studio. Types of headphone Headphones now come in a wide variety of species, and it’s not unusual to own different headphones for different purposes. Traditional headphones come in on-ear and over-ear versions, which is mainly a matter of taste. Open-backed versions let more sound in and out, which suits home use. Closed-back versions are better for commuting. Headphones for travellers can be foldable and often include noise-cancelling, where Bose is the market leader. Headphones for gamers usually include a microphone. There are small and light headphones for the exercise market, and earbuds that provide extreme portability. Some models offer extra bass, if you only listen to the sort of music that needs it. In my experience, headphones marketed for pro, studio or DJ use generally sound better, even if you’d be hard pressed to find real pros using them. Try lots of different headphones to find out which type you prefer. Over the past decade, wireless and Bluetooth headphones have become more popular, thanks partly to some dramatic increases in sound quality. Nonetheless, wires remain cheaper and work better. Wireless systems can suffer from lag, which can be annoying when watching movies. They may sometimes lose the connection, or run out of power. Adding wireless costs money so, at any given price level, wired headphones almost always sound better. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t buy wireless headphones, because there are advantages to not being tethered. But you should check for lag if you plan to watch movies. Possible options It’s not worth spending a lot of time trying headphones if you’re spending £50/$50 or less. Reading some online reviews should be enough, especially if you stick to major brands such as AKG, Audio-Technica, Grado, Sennheiser, and Sony. Sadly, Sennheiser has dropped its cheap and lively HD 202-II headphones, and the 2006-vintage HD 201 (£24.99/$29.95) seems to be on the way out. The HD 206 (£23/$34), launched this year, appears to be a reasonable replacement, though AKG K92 (£36/$59) or Creative Aurvana Live (£59.99/$50) headphones would provide a step up in quality. Among the pricier headphones, I like the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x (£121/$129), which are billed as “professional monitor headphones.” It may therefore be worth trying the cheaper versions, the ATH-M20x (£42/$39) and ATH-M30x (£59/$59). If you prefer on-ear phones, you could try the AKG Y50 headphones (£59.95/$109.85, but there’s a yellow version for $89.95). AKG also does a Y50BT Bluetooth version, which pushes the price up to £114/$149.99. However, at these price levels, the open-backed Grado SR80e Prestige Series (£95/$99) and the closed-back Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO (£114/$155) headphones are worth a listen. The DT 770s come in three different impedance levels. The 32 ohm version is suitable for smartphones and portable devices. The 80 ohm version is for studio use, and the 250 ohm version for professional mixing. Headphones like these have been around for many years, and people will still be buying them long after trendier models have come and gone. How about earbuds? Facebook Twitter Pinterest Earbuds have dramatically improved over the years. Photograph: Google Early earbuds, like early Bluetooth headphones, generally sounded awful, but today you can get very good sound quality for relatively little money. The SoundMagic E10 Isolating Earphones seemed to become an instant classic at £34.99/$41.99, and they are hard to beat at the price. Sony also has a great track record for earbuds, and the MDR-EX650AP (£37/$40) is a popular alternative. You could spend a long time arguing which is best, but I suspect it depends a lot on the shape of your ears, and how well the earbuds fit. I’m not sure it’s worth spending a lot more on products that are so easily broken or lost, unless you’re willing to pay for high quality wireless earbuds. Indeed, you could just buy Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds for around £14.90/$11.99 and replace them as often as necessary. Either way, there are hundreds of headphones and earbuds on the market, and you should buy the ones you like best. The final decision is always personal. Have you got a question?

The Echo Spot is small sphere with a 2.5in circular screen, camera and clock face that’s capable of showing the time as well as other at-a-glance information, similar to the larger Echo Show that launched earlier in the year. “The Spot is to the Show what the Dot is to the original Echo,” said Rich Suplee, head of Alexa for Amazon in Europe. “So this is a smaller, stylish and more affordable version of an Echo with a screen.” Amazon found great success with its Echo Dot, which was a smaller, cheaper alternative to the full-size Echo speaker – effectively an Echo with a less powerful speaker. The Echo Spot similarly has most of the features of its more expensive sibling, the £200 Echo Show, condensed into a smaller, cheaper package. The Echo Spot, however, does not share the Dot’s impulse-buy pricing of £50, instead costing £120 each or £200 for two, available for pre-order today and shipping on 24 January. “The Echo Spot has proved extremely popular in the US market and is a great addition to Amazon’s Echo line up in the UK,” said Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, expecting similar popularity in the UK. “Adding a screen gives a whole new dimension to using an Echo device. By providing visual as well as voice interactions it helps users learn about what information Alexa can provide. It also makes purchases using Alexa much more viable because you can see a product before buying it.” The Echo Spot has a camera for video calling to other Echo devices or the Alexa app on smartphones, can play video, music and other smart speaker-associated features. It uses a new four-mic array to hear users, which is a condensed version of the seven or eight-mic arrays used in other Echo devices. It has a reasonable speaker built into it, but also has 3.5mm analogue audio output and Bluetooth for connecting to existing systems. Amazon is also continuing to roll out a greater level of conversational ability and personality to Alexa, an important part of the next stage of the evolution of voice assistants and Amazon’s battle with Google. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The online retailer now has five different models of its Echo speaker with various different capabilities, with and without a screen. Photograph: Elaine Thompson/AP “Alexa is gaining new opinions about things every day. If you’re curious about her favourite dog breed you can ask her. She can share a little look into her soul,” said Suplee. The online retailer now has five different models of its Echo speaker with various different capabilities, with and without a screen. But it also has third-party manufacturers building Alexa into devices as diverse as voice-enabled showers, mirrors, ovens and cars. Wood said: “Amazon has got some real momentum at the moment. It is the undisputed leader in smart speakers and the range of Echo devices is starting to cater for lots of different use cases, be it an affordable Echo Dot or the high-end Echo Show which is a larger version of the Echo Spot.” Meanwhile, Google has two own-brand smart speakers, the Google Home and Home Mini, and similarly followed Amazon’s lead announcing multiple third-party manufacturers are integrating Google Assistant into their devices, including those with screens from the likes of LG. Ben Stanton, analyst with Canalys, said that 75% of all smart speaker shipments went to the US in 2017 leaving lots of room for growth globally. He said: “Amazon might have a leading position in the US, but in Europe it is still all to play for. “Amazon and Google still view overseas markets as an untapped opportunity. This is why both Amazon and Google have relentlessly pursued new price points and new styles of smart speaker.” Stanton said that getting their foot into the door of new households was key. He said: “Once Amazon or Google get their customer, it opens an incredible opportunity to sell more speakers for new rooms, and lock out their competitors in that household. “We expect them to pour money into European marketing as the battle intensifies.” How smart speakers stole the show from smartphones Topics Amazon Alexa Amazon Smart speaker Gadgets news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most viewed World UK Science Cities Global development Football Tech Business Environment Obituaries back to top become a supporter make a contribution securedrop ask for help advertise with us work for us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy digital newspaper archive all topics all contributors Facebook Twitter © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Noah Berger/AP Amid unceasing criticism of Facebook’s immense power and pernicious impact on society, its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced Thursday that his “personal challenge” for 2018 will be “to focus on fixing these important issues”. Zuckerberg’s new year’s resolution – a tradition for the executive who in previous years has pledged to learn Mandarin, run 365 miles, and read a book each week – is a remarkable acknowledgment of the terrible year Facebook has had. “Facebook has a lot of work to do – whether it’s protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent,” Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page. “We won’t prevent all mistakes or abuse, but we currently make too many errors enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools.” Facebook declines to say why it deletes certain political accounts, but not others Read more At the beginning of 2017, as many liberals were grappling with Donald Trump’s election and the widening divisions in American society, Zuckerberg embarked on a series of trips to meet regular Americans in all 50 states. But while Zuckerberg was donning hard hats and riding tractors, an increasing number of critics both inside and outside of the tech industry were identifying Facebook as a key driver of many of society’s current ills. The past year has seen the social media company try – and largely fail – to get a handle on the proliferation of misinformation on its platform; acknowledge that it enabled a Russian influence operation to influence the US presidential election; and concede that its products can damage users’ mental health. By attempting to take on these complex problems as his annual personal challenge, Zuckerberg is, for the first time, setting himself a task that he is unlikely to achieve. With 2 billion users and a presence in almost every country, the company’s challenges are no longer bugs that can be addressed by engineering code. Facebook, like other tech giants, has long maintained that it is essentially politically neutral – the company has “community standards” but no clearly articulated political orientation. While in past years, that neutrality has enabled Facebook to grow at great speed without assuming responsibility for how individuals or governments used its tools, the political tumult of recent years has made such a stance increasingly untenable. The difficulty of Facebook’s task is illustrated in the company’s current conundrum over enforcing of US sanctions against some world leaders but not others, leaving observers to wonder what rules, if any, Facebook is actually playing by. New Year's resolutions for big tech: how Silicon Valley can be better in 2018 Read more Zuckerberg acknowledged that the problems facing a platform with 2 billion users “touch on questions of history, civics, political philosophy, media, government, and of course technology” and said that he planned to consult with experts in those fields. But the second half of Zuckerberg’s post, in which he discusses centralization and decentralization of power in technology, reveal Zuckerberg’s general approach: proposing technological solutions to political problems. If Zuckerberg is interested in decentralization of power, he might wish to address his company’s pattern of aggressively acquiring its competitors – or simply copying their features. Instead, the executive introduced a non sequitur about encryption and cryptocurrency, neither of which will do anything to address Facebook’s role in, for example, stoking anti-Rohingya hatred in Myanmar. If Zuckerberg truly intends to spend a year trying to figure out how the blockchain can solve intractable geopolitical problems, he would be better off just doing Whole30.

Claims of Russian meddling dominated 2017. The US midterm elections will be first big test of Facebook’s effort to stamp it out Alex Hern @alexhern Thu 28 Dec 2017 19.00 GMT Last modified on Thu 28 Dec 2017 19.02 GMT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Mark Zuckerberg initially described the suggestion that Facebook had swayed voters as a ‘crazy idea’. He later said he regretted the remark. Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Social networks spent much of 2017 slowly coming to terms with the extent to which their platforms had been exploited to spread political misinformation. But the narrow focus of investigations over the last year is likely to cause further pain in 2018, as the US midterm elections create a new urgency for the problem to be solved. At the beginning of this year, Facebook was hostile to the suggestion that it may have played an unwitting part in a foreign influence campaign. After the election of Donald Trump, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, described the suggestion that his site may have swayed voters as a “crazy idea”, despite evidence that hoaxes and lies had been spread on the social network during the campaign. (He later apologised for the comment, saying it was “dismissive and I regret it”.) By April the company had changed its tune, publishing the findings of a lengthy investigation into “information operations and Facebook” that described all the “subtle and insidious forms of misuse” that could occur on the site, “including attempts to manipulate civic discourse and deceive people”. Facebook and Twitter threatened with sanctions in UK 'fake news' inquiry Read more One thing missing from that white paper was the identity of the malicious actor. It later emerged that the company had cut mentions of Russia from the document before publication owing to legal concerns. In a follow-up blogpost in September it had no such qualms: the company revealed the extent of Russian interference for the first time, noting that it had found almost 500 inauthentic accounts and pages that altogether had spent $100,000 on ads. From there the story snowballed. In October the company shared further information about the ads and how many people had seen them (126 million at the latest count), and it testified alongside Google and Twitter at a hostile committee hearing at the US Congress. Twitter, too, had to reveal some uncomfortable truths. It released a list of more than 2,700 accounts it believed were run by the Internet Research Agency, a St Petersburg-based “troll army”. It also had an embarrassing spat with the Russian news organisations Sputnik and RT over whether or not the millions of dollars it took in advertising from the state-owned broadcasters amounted to foreign interference. It eventually donated the cash to fund academic research into elections and civil engagement and banned the organisations from further advertising. Google, for its part, has emerged remarkably clean. Despite the search engine’s well-documented fake news problem – it has regularly placed questionable reporting or outright falsehoods at the top of its search results for breaking news events – the company apparently avoided being specifically targeted for manipulation by the Internet Research Agency. As 2017 winds to a close, Facebook could be forgiven for thinking its problems are behind it. But two big concerns still lie ahead, threatening to drag the issue back on to the front pages in the new year. Firstly, the fear of Russian misinformation has gone international, and Facebook is making unforced errors in its response. Circumstantial evidence suggests Russian influence campaigns were far more widespread than just the US, with votes in France, Germany and the UK all affected to a greater or lesser extent. But whereas the social network’s response in the US was a months-long investigation culminating in the handover to Congress of a significant amount of data, in the UK the company has been accused of fobbing off parliament with a lazy repetition of its previous findings. “It would appear that no work has been done by Facebook to look for Russian activity around the EU referendum, other than from funded advertisements from those accounts that had already been identified as part of the US Senate’s investigation,” said the Tory MP Damian Collins, chair of the select committee that is pushing Facebook for answers on this matter. “No work has been done by Facebook to look for other fake accounts and pages that could be linked to Russian-backed agencies and which were active during the EU referendum, as I requested.” And then there is November. The US midterms will be the first serious test of Facebook’s commitment to fixing its platform. The company has promised changes to its political advertising products to increase transparency, as well as enforcement of rules limiting spending to Americans only. But it has not yet had to enforce those rules on a grand scale, over hundreds of separate races happening simultaneously. If it fails to stick the landing then the whole cycle will begin again.

This year, Facebook turned on its notification function for attacks in London and Las Vegas, Stockholm and St Petersburg. But do we feel more secure?

Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock You know the drill by now: a terrorist atrocity or catastrophe occurs in your home town, and no sooner have you seen the news than you receive a Facebook notification that one of your friends has marked themselves safe, or that another is asking you to do so. This was my experience during the attack in Westminster in March, with friends as far away as Canada asking me to declare myself “safe”. Clicking on Facebook’s nagging notification revealed 31 of my friends were apparently out of danger, but a further 249 were “not marked as safe”. Since it was first launched in 2014, Safety Check has become an increasingly important part of the way Facebook would like to see itself: as the big benign blue entity that wants to protect you, its citizen. But Safety Check has proven controversial. It was turned on for the Manhattan truck attack that killed eight on Halloween. Although terrible, the scale of the danger was similar to the one in Westminster, leading New Yorkers to question whether the functionality should even have been turned on. LeTroy (@mrLdavis) Girl, you live in Alabama why are you on Facebook marking yourself safe for an incident thats happening in New York October 31, 2017 Facebook also turned Safety Check on for the Grenfell Tower fire, itself an incredibly tragic but relatively contained disaster, and again for the attack in Las Vegas, which helped spread false reports that the shooter was Trump-hating leftwing terrorist. Yes, Facebook, I am safe – no thanks for asking | Tim Burrows Read more Where, in the west, Facebook has been criticised for using the function unnecessarily, a large number of Iranians criticised the social network for not activating the feature quickly enough, after more than 400 died during the Iran-Iraq earthquake in November. Facebook says it did activate Safety Check following the earthquake on 12 November, but the site was blocked by the Iranian government – although users can find a way around this for day-to-day activity. Facebook as guardian of safety Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook’s wants its two billion users to feel safe by living through Facebook. Photograph: Kim Kulish/Corbis via Getty Images Safety Check forms part of Facebook’s grand plan to make users feel “more safe”. And like most things concerning the social network, its primary solution appears to be “more Facebook”. The onus is always on the user to share more, engage more – all the while feeding Facebook’s appetite for data. The cumulative effect of Facebook as guardian of our safety is that the world outside appears more and more frightening. “What happens is, it sets a default position in the sense that you are not safe unless you are seen to be safe,” says Dr Aaron Balick, a psychotherapist and author of The Psychodynamics of Social Networking. “I would prefer the other default position: that you are safe until you let somebody know that you are not.” xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> It's the algorithmic version of the Mexican wave in football stadiums. And that’s exactly what you don’t want Dr Aaron Balick Fear and panic are contagious during suspected terror attacks, and in social media and smartphones we have means of spreading these feelings faster than at any other point in history. “When [a reaction on social media] is set off, it is the algorithmic version of the Mexican wave you get in football stadiums. And that’s exactly what you don’t want: the spreading of panic, chaos and fear, particularly when something is localised,” Balick says. “You saw this happen in the Oxford Street incident in November. Suddenly, Twitter is erupting with people spreading emotional contagion, when there was no event. I don’t think it’s a conscious thing, but people want to be part of the action, in a sense – sharing the excitement of it.” Notably, Facebook did not switch on Safety Check for the Oxford Street panic. Despite the event being partly triggered by the activity of its users, the company says it won’t turn on Safety Check unless an incident is verified by “global crisis reporting agencies” NC4 and iJET. This suggests that some kind of intervention by a social network as popular as Facebook could be useful, at least in verifying the validity of disasters. Which in turn raises the question: isn’t that what news is for? Administration of fear Facebook Twitter Pinterest An armed policeman runs down Oxford Street to respond to an incident in November – which turned out to be a fist fight. Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images The French theorist Paul Virilio named the state of being that tech-led eventualities such as Safety Check bring with them “the administration of fear”. In 2012, he wrote: “How can we not see that fear has been administered, in the strict meaning of the term, by instant interactivity, in particular in the functions that relate to real-time communications?” Although Facebook says the goal of Safety Check is to “ensure people feel safe and connected during a crisis, not to cause panic or false alarm”, in pandering to our engagement at times of panic, it is quickly becoming fear’s administrator-in-chief. “Facebook should be asking itself what it is out there to do,” says Balick. “Presumably it’s out there to be a social network. We now have situations in cities where [local authorities] can send out text messages to people’s mobile phones to let them know that there is a dangerous situation going on, which is a job for the civil engineers and authorities who understand that stuff and who can localise that stuff.” Even if Facebook did want to put the genie back in the bottle, it might be too late. Many people simply expect to be able to mark themselves as safe in moments of crisis. And while the social network has attracted criticism for its blanket approach, the function has been received warmly by some in parts of the developing world: when Nigerians experienced Safety Check for the first time after a Boko Haram attack in 2015, many saw it as a “sign of respect”. Perhaps Facebook’s best chance of becoming a trusted protector is to show greater prudence about switching on the function in the first place – and to figure out what might benefit society, instead of simply hankering after our every engagement. As Balick puts it: “The danger is that Facebook becomes responsive to human wants rather than to what is good for us.” Topics Facebook Social networking Internet analysis Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story Facebook to expand inquiry into Russian influence of Brexit Tech giant looks into spreading of disinformation after MPs criticised scope of first investigation Published: 17 Jan 2018 Facebook to expand inquiry into Russian influence of Brexit Facebook warned it faces legal action from ‘revenge porn’ victims Settlement with teenager over naked images of her posted online on networking site has ‘moved goalposts’, say lawyers Published: 12 Jan 2018 Facebook warned it faces legal action from ‘revenge porn’ victims Why Facebook's news feed is changing – and how it will affect you The social media site wants its users to ‘have more meaningful interactions’, but what does that mean in practice?

Photograph: Steve Marcus/Reuters The secret to rekindling Sony’s return to form, according to the company’s chief executive, is personalisation – achieved not by the mass collection of customer data in the way some big tech firms do, but by eliciting an emotional response to its products. “Getting in close is the only way,” says Kaz Hirai, who took the helm of Sony five-and-half-years ago charged with turning the company around; he has succeeded, with Sony projecting its largest-ever annual operating profit of £4.2bn this year. Hirai is a passionate believer in the Japanese concept of Kando, which is about establishing an emotional connection across what Sony calls “the last one inch” to the consumer – the wow factor that creates enthusiasm and loyalty. “My father and grandfather were Sony fanatics,” he says. “When I was about five years old, my father recorded my voice on his open reel tape deck and played it back. Hearing my own voice was a technological wonder. “We had a huge TV, but we also had a five-inch TV, and I found it wonderful that Sony could miniaturise these products.” But by the time Hirai took over as chief executive that wow factor had faded. “Sony products need to have functional and emotional value,” says Hirai, who made it his mission to apply Kando across every business unit and revive faded glory. “Anybody can provide functional value in this commoditised space, but emotional value is something that has been part of the Sony design philosophy, part of the Sony DNA since the company started 71 years ago. We kind of lost it for a while, and my job has been to revive that pride in what we do in terms of providing emotional value.” Aibo, Sony’s revived robotic dog, embodies Kando, showcasing Sony’s AI and robotics by replicating some of the endearing qualities of a real dog. Aibo can recognise faces and voices, while sensors on his head, chin and back mean that it responds physical stimuli.

Hirai has sought to extend Sony’s positive corporate culture following the damaging leaked email scandal in 2014. Photograph: Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images “If there’s a challenge, organisationally or financially, I have to get in there and do it myself,” Hirai says. “When businesses are running well, we have fine executives who can run them day to day. But when the fires are up, somebody’s got to get in there and do the hard work, stop the fires and turn the business around.” Hirai’s hands-on approach to leadership extends to the highly-charged environment of Hollywood, which has been rocked by the recent sexual harassment scandals, where he sought to extend Sony’s positive corporate culture following Sony’s own damaging leaked email scandal in 2014. “At Sony, we have absolute zero tolerance not just for sexual harassment, but for any type of harassment,” he says. “We want to provide a safe, comfortable and trusting environment for our employees all over the world. “We have about 120,000 employees and we have policies in place to ensure that employees and management understand that we have zero tolerance for any of this stuff and if there are infractions, employees should feel comfortable reporting them to management as quickly as possible in the knowledge that each and every one of these incidents will be investigated, and if appropriate action needs to be taken, it will be taken very swiftly. We have a good policy in place, and we continue reinforcing it.” From February to August last year, when Hirai was looking for a new head for Sony Pictures Entertainment following the departure of Michael Lynton to Snapchat, hespent two weeks a month at the studio in Culver City, California. “I wanted to get to know the business better,” he says. “I wanted to be able to have an intelligent dialogue with potential candidates so that I could answer their questions and say here are some things I expect you to do.” While he was there, he took the opportunity to walk the floor, meeting rank-and-file employees to understand their issues and motivations. “Sony Pictures is a big lot, and I didn’t want to zip by in a golf cart. I wanted people to see me walking from one end of the studio to the other meeting and greeting employees.” “Through these interactions, I got the message across to them that the president of the organisation from Tokyo was willing to spend two weeks a month getting to understand it and finding it the right CEO. And the culture at Sony Pictures Entertainment has shifted because people understand that Tokyo has got their back.” Great design should remain unchanged Facebook Twitter Pinterest Visitors and media reporters ogle a PS4 game console during the Tokyo Game Show in 2013. Photograph: The Asahi Shimbun/The Asahi Shimbun via Getty Imag Hirai has turned around every business he has led. In 2006, when he became president of Sony Computer Entertainment, PlayStation reported losses of ¥230bn following the PS3 debacle. Hirai turned the business around and brought in new management, who produced the phenomenally successful PS4. Central to Hirai’s strategy is creating enduring brands, which involved shifting Sony’s design culture. When Hirai became chief executive, as is typical in consumer electronics, every product iteration would include a redesign. “I sat down with the managers of each major product category and said to them, ‘if you think it’s a great design, don’t change it. Be proud of what you did, and be proud enough to stick with it.’ “It’s a cultural change that we brought about. It shows Sony’s respect for the products we make. If it’s good enough for the customers, it should be good enough for us not to change designs every year. That is how we create emotional value.” This approach has proved particularly effective with the company’s high-end RX cameras and headphones brands. But away from consumer electronics, Sony’s focus has shifted towards AI and robotics, image sensors (via its semiconductor business) and PlayStation, which has 70 million users worldwide. Hirai is not complacent about PlayStation’s lead in gaming or Sony Pictures’ string of hit movies. “Sony Pictures has had some great hits this year, but they need a sustainable model. We had a hit with Spider-Man [Homecoming] last year, and that means that we get to do a lot of business with DVDs, Blu-rays and licensing of Spiderman this year and beyond. How successful you are or not in year one determines the business in year two and year three going forward, and then it’s staggered. It is a complex business.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Spiderman Homecoming. Photograph: Allstar/Marvel Studios/Columbia Pictures The company is seeking new applications for its AI, sensors and robotics in autonomous vehicles. The firm says, for instance, that its market-leading image sensors can help vehicles “see” better than humans, with wide-angle lenses for better visibility and the ability to adjust instantly to low or changing light conditions. Hirai announced partnerships with leading automotive manufacturers at CES in Las Vegas, but admits that this is still a nascent venture that isn’t expected to bring in revenue for several years. “For now, the main drivers of the image-sensor business are smartphones, digital cameras and some surveillance and IoT [Internet of Things]. We need to make sure that we have a stable business today so that we can segue into the automotive tomorrow.” Sony’s image sensors are used in leading smartphone brands – Hirai jokes about supplying “little” companies in Cupertino, South Korea and China – but its own smartphones struggle outside Japan. Some have suggested Sony Mobile should throw in the towel, but Hirai disagrees: “The reason we’re doing that is not because we think smartphones are the future, but because we have to have some devices connected to a network in order to communicate. If we get out of the [communications] space, we won’t have the opportunity to play in the next paradigm shift.” “It’s not about the smartphones of today; it’s more about looking beyond smartphones – at what are we going to be doing – and to be a player in this space; ideally to be a leader. For that strategic reason, I want to make sure we stay, not in the smartphone business, per se, but in the communications business.” Sony’s restructuring appears to be paying off, reporting what analysts called “blowout results” for the second quarter based on a mix of old and new business, and projecting full-year profits up 20% on last year - quite a change from an organisation in decline reporting £3bn losses when Hirai took over. But he is not complacent: “This is not the time to be doing a victory lap because we still have another quarter to go before the end of the fiscal year. We have to make sure we hit the numbers or even do better. That’s job one. Job two is to ensure that we don’t fall off the cliff next year, as we’ve done that in the past.” While Hirai may not believe that smartphones are the future, and his focus for 2018 is sustainable profit, Sony is still open to new technology, whichever path that takes. “We need to make sure we are proactively investing for future businesses in terms of technology as well as business models, so that we can leave the company in better shape as we hand it off to the next generation,” said Hirai.

Photograph: Google Name: Zooglers. Origin: 75 different countries. Appearance: Pleased with themselves. Why is that? Because they live in Zurich, which is consistently ranked as one of the best cities in the world. And because they work at Google, which has the coolest offices there. Oh God. I’m afraid so. They work on Google Search, Maps, Calendar, YouTube and Gmail, as well as artificial intelligence and other projects. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Way to go: going between floors at Google’s Zurich office. Photograph: Google Like how to make me remember all my passwords? Maybe. And to make the staff happy and efficient, the Google campus on Brandschenkestrasse, the company’s biggest R&D hub outside the US, takes the concept of “fun” offices to a frightening new level. Work isn’t meant to be fun! That’s why you have to pay people to do it. That’s an increasingly outdated view. Shall I tell you what’s available to the Zooglers? By all means. Let me just prepare this sick bag. There are firefighter’s poles and spiral slides between floors, plus imitation sleeper carriages and baths of foam cubes that you can nap in. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Zooglers can relax in a foam bath. Photograph: Google Can I? Sorry, no. Not you. Only people invited into the building can do these things. Right. There’s a “jungle lounge”, where you can work surrounded by 100 different plant varieties. Then, if you want to get away from the plants, there’s a big, furry egg to sit in. I work surrounded by quite a lot of mould varieties. That’s nice. The Zooglers have table tennis and pinball, but also a band rehearsal room, a cinema, a gym and a Lego room. There are circular curtained-off meeting rooms, as in a dystopian hospital. There are cable cars to sit in for no reason. There’s a room with a piano in it. And free good food. Now you’re talking! Plus, every day at 5pm they play the Heidi theme music, which is the signal to gather in the Hürlimann bar to drink beer and socialise in a relaxed manner that continues to make money. Real snow on the floor so you can ski between desks? No. Facebook Twitter Pinterest In the cable-car work pods. Photograph: Google Fondue Fridays? Not as far as I’m aware. But they do enjoy where they are. “We’re delighted for the opportunity to be at the heart of Zurich during such exciting times,” says the head of Google Switzerland, Patrick Warnking. Financial services-themed costume parties? Absolutely not. Do say: “How dare these Americans turn a historic Swiss city into a nauseating monument to lavishness. Zurich is the home of Fifa, for goodness sake!” Don’t say: “How do you expect me to enjoy the free flow of ideas without a desk made out of Toblerones?” Topics Google Pass notes Alphabet Work & careers Switzerland features Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most viewed Money Property Pensions Savings Borrowing Careers back to top become a supporter make a contribution securedrop ask for help advertise with us work for us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy digital newspaper archive all topics all contributors Facebook Twitter © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Hold app – already used by 40% of students in Norway – allows users to earn rewards such as cinema tickets for not using their phone. We put it to the test Poppy Noor @PoppyNoor Mon 15 Jan 2018 12.00 GMT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close A screengrab of the Hold app. It’s March 2012, the middle of exam term and my friend is in despair. Why? She can’t access her Facebook. Nordic app Hold is hoping to combat such examples of student smartphone addiction. It rewards users for not looking at their phones on campus – a task so difficult for my zombified-friend that she resorted to using a website that locks her out of all social media accounts. In Norway, 40% of students use Hold. One in eight people are addicted to their phones and, at university, this can be toxic. Using Hold requires self-restraint: press a button and the app will time how long you refrain from using your phone, but there are no punishments if you do. If you don’t, however, you will be rewarded with points that can be redeemed at partner businesses – you can cash in for cinema tickets, for example. Since I’m still a student, I decided to put the app to the test. It’s harder than I imagine – I am the sort of person, it turns out, who just needs to look at this email right now... And this WhatsApp. And my Instagram. And, er … Candy Crush. Why doesn’t the app just block me from distractions, so I’m not tempted by them? “We are trying to change long-term habits, not force people,” says creator Maths Mathiesen. “We want their relationship to their phones to change.” By the end of the week, the app hadn’t changed my phone-checking habits, but it did make me seriously question my phone usage. Resisting my phone for 20 minutes (the threshold at which you can start earning points for rewards) proved excruciating – but it also highlighted how much looking at my phone for a second disrupts my concentration span. Hold is still building up its network of sponsors in the UK, with beta versions being rolled out across universities in London over the next month. The rewards on offer are currently quite limited – one of them is pencils – although I’m told that Nordic students have won trips around the world. But I suppose the real reward is not spending £50,000 on a degree, only to end up with a bad grade thanks to your need to compulsively refresh, scroll and repeat.

Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images I’ve been watching this bitcoin situation for a few years, assuming it would just blow over. But a collective insanity has sprouted around the new field of “cryptocurrencies”, causing an irrational gold rush worldwide. It has gotten to the point where a large number of financial stories – and questions in my inbox – ask whether or not to “invest” in BitCoin. Let’s start with the answer: no. You should not invest in Bitcoin. The reason why is that it’s not an investment; just as gold, tulip bulbs, Beanie Babies, and rare baseball cards are also not investments. These are all things that people have bought in the past, driving them to absurd prices, not because they did anything useful or produced money or had social value, but solely because people thought they could sell them on to someone else for more money in the future. When you make this kind of purchase – which you should never do – you are speculating. This is not a useful activity. You’re playing a psychological, win-lose battle against other humans with money as the sole objective. Even if you win money through dumb luck, you have lost time and energy, which means you have lost. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies 'will come to bad end', says Warren Buffett Read more Investing means buying an asset that actually creates products, services or cashflow, such as a profitable business or a rentable piece of real estate, for an extended period of time. An investment is something that has intrinsic value – that is, it would be worth owning from a financial perspective, even if you could never sell it. To answer why bitcoin has become so big, we need to separate the usefulness of the underlying technology called “blockchain” from the mania of people turning bitcoin into a big dumb lottery. Blockchain is simply a nifty software invention (which is open-source and free for anyone to use), whereas bitcoin is just one well-known way to use it. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A bitcoin is not an investment, just as gold, tulip bulbs, Beanie Babies, and rare baseball cards are also not investments. Photograph: Michael S Green/AP Blockchain is a computer protocol that allows two people (or machines) to do transactions (sometimes anonymously) even if they don’t trust each other or the network between them. It can have monetary applications or in sharing files, but it’s not some instant trillionaire magic. As a real-world comparison for blockchain and bitcoin, take this example from the blogger The Unassuming Banker: Imagine that someone had found a cure for cancer and posted the step-by-step instructions on how to make it online, freely available for anyone to use. Now imagine that the same person also created a product called Cancer-Pill using their own instructions, trade marked it, and started selling it to the highest bidders. I think we can all agree a cure for cancer is immensely valuable to society (blockchain may or may not be, we still have to see), however, how much is a Cancer-Pill worth? Our banker goes on to explain that the first Cancer-Pill (bitcoin) might initially see some great sales. Prices would rise, especially if supply was limited (just as an artificial supply limit is built into the bitcoin algorithm). xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> Bitcoin has become a bubble with the forces of human herd behavior, greed, and fear of missing out amplifying it But since the formula is open and free, other companies quickly come out with their own cancer pills. Cancer-Away, CancerBgone, CancEthereum, and any other number of competitors would spring up. Anybody can make a pill, and it costs only a few cents per dose. Yet imagine everybody starts bidding up Cancer-Pills to the point that they cost $17,000 each and fluctuate widely in price, seemingly for no reason. Newspapers start reporting on prices daily, triggering so many tales of instant riches that even your barber and your massage therapist are offering tips on how to invest in this new “asset class”. Instead of seeing how ridiculous this is, more people start bidding up every new variety of pill (cryptocurrencies), until they are some of the most “valuable” things on the planet. That is what’s happening with bitcoin. This screenshot from coinmarketcap.com illustrates this real-life human herd behavior: Facebook Twitter Pinterest Various cryptocurrencies, ranked by how many people have been fooled. Photograph: coinmarketcap.com “Holy shit!” is the only reasonable reaction. You’ve got bitcoin with a market value of $238bn, then Ethereum at $124bn, and so on. The imaginary value of these valueless bits of computer data represents enough money to change the course of the human race, for example, eliminating poverty or replacing the world’s 800 gigawatts of coal power plants with solar generation. Bitcoin (AKA Cancer-Pills) has become an investment bubble, with the complementary forces of human herd behavior, greed, fear of missing out, and a lack of understanding of past financial bubbles amplifying it. To better understand this mania, we need to look at why bitcoin was invented in the first place. As the legend goes, in 2008 an anonymous developer published a white paper under the fake name Satoshi Nakamoto. The author was evidently a software and math person. But the paper also has some in-built ideology: the assumption that giving national governments the ability to monitor flows of money in the financial system and use it as a form of law enforcement is wrong. Bitcoin is a bubble, but the technology behind it could transform the world | Will Hutton Read more This financial libertarian streak is at the core of bitcoin. You’ll hear echoes of that sentiment in all the pro-crypto blogs and podcasts. The sensible-sounding ones will say: “Sure the G20 nations all have stable financial systems, but bitcoin is a lifesaver in places like Venezuela where the government can vaporize your wealth when you sleep.” The harder-core pundits say: “Even the US Federal Reserve is a bunch ‘a’ crooks, stealing your money via inflation, and that nasty fiat currency they issue is nothing but toilet paper!” It’s all the same stuff that people say about gold – another waste of human investment energy. Government-issued currencies have value because they represent human trust and cooperation. There is no wealth and no trade without these two things, so you might as well go all in and trust people. The other argument for bitcoin’s “value” is that there will only ever be 21m of them, and they will eventually replace all other world currencies, or at least become the “new gold”, so the fundamental value is either the entire world’s GDP or at least the total value of all gold, divided by 21m. Facebook Twitter Pinterest An electronic signboard of a Bithumb cryptocurrency exchange in Seoul, South Korea. Photograph: Yonhap/EPA People who think that there’s even a tiny chance bitcoin could become a world currency say it is severely undervalued. You could make the same argument about my fingernail clippings: they may have no intrinsic value, but they’re in limited supply so let’s use them as the new world currency. Let’s get this straight: in order for bitcoin to be a real currency, it needs several things: Easy and frictionless trading between people. To be widely accepted as legal tender for all debts, public and private. A stable value that does not fluctuate (otherwise it’s impossible to set prices). Bitcoin has none of these things, and even safely storing it is difficult. Bitcoin exchanges such as Mt Gox in Japan, Bitfinex and various other wallets and exchanges have been hacked. The second point is crucial. Bitcoin is only valuable if it truly becomes a critical world currency. In other words, if you truly need it to buy stuff, and thus you need to buy coins from some other person in order to conduct important bits of world commerce that you can’t do any other way. Right now, speculators are the only people driving up the price. A speculative cult currency like bitcoin is only valuable when you cash it out to a real currency, like the US dollar, and use it to buy something useful like a nice house or a business. When the supply of foolish speculators dries up the value evaporates – often very quickly. A currency should also not be artificially sparse. It needs to expand with the supply of goods and services in the world, otherwise we end up with deflation and hoarding. It helps to have the Federal Reserve system and other central banks guiding the system. Bitcoin drops $2,000 in value as South Korea announces planned trading ban Read more Finally, nothing becomes a good investment just because “it’s been going up in price lately”. The world’s governments are not going to let everyone start trading money anonymously and evading taxes using bitcoin. If cryptocurrency does take off, it will be in a government-backed form, like a new “Fedcoin”. Full anonymity and government evasion will not be one of its features. The cryptocurrency bubble is really a repetition of the past. This is a known bug in our operating system, and we have designed some parts of our society to protect us against it. These days, stocks in the US are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, precisely, because in the olden days, there were many stocks issued that were much like bitcoin, marketed to unsophisticated investors as a get-rich-quick scheme. The very definition of this investor is: “Being more willing to buy something the more its price goes up.” Don’t be one of these fools.

Loss of the deal with the giant mobile carrier has put a huge obstacle in the way of the Chinese firm’s ambition of conquering the American market Charles Arthur @charlesarthur Sat 13 Jan 2018 16.00 GMT Last modified on Wed 17 Jan 2018 17.48 GMT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close A 2012 House Intelligence Committee report saw Huawei banned from selling telecoms equipment but not smartphones – until now. Photograph: David Becker/Getty Images Amid the glitz and glamour of the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas last week, one piece of news struck a particularly sour note for Chinese phone-maker Huawei. Despite months of preparation, the giant US mobile carrier AT&T announced last Monday that it was pulling out of a deal to sell Huawei’s smartphones. The decision was taken as a result of political pressure on AT&T by American politicians, who had written to the telecoms regulator the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) – which must approve the sale of phones and other devices in the US – saying they had “long been concerned about Chinese espionage in general, and Huawei’s role in that espionage in particular”. Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei’s consumer division, was obliged to go through the motions at CES of introducing his new Mate 10 phone, having seen planned marketing spending of $100m and assurances of no government interference turn to ashes. For Huawei, it is a wearily familiar story. Although its $75bn annual revenues make it the world’s largest maker of telecoms equipment, including mobile masts and phones, Huawei has been repeatedly rebuffed in the US over suspicions that its Chinese origins make it untrustworthy. In US politicians’ eyes, the fact its founder Ren Zhengfei was once a Red Army officer is a stain that cannot be washed away. Australia, too, has banned it from providing equipment for the government’s national broadband network, though it can sell network equipment to private companies there. But Huawei is not alone. Earlier this month, the committee on foreign investment in the United States (CFIUS), which can block overseas acquisitions, stopped Chinese firm Ant Financial’s $1.2bn purchase of US money transfer business Moneygram. CFIUS was not convinced that US citizens’ data would be safeguarded. Last autumn, the US Department of Homeland Security told government departments to stop using Kaspersky Lab, the Moscow-based company which provides antivirus and cyber-security products, on the basis it was “concerned about the ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and other government agencies”. It is too soon to say whether this is a pattern under the Trump administration, whose leader has repeatedly said China is ripping the US off, but then retreated from any action. Whether the US would seek a quid pro quo – where Huawei might be allowed in if Google, Facebook and Twitter can sell their services (via advertising and social networks) inside China – is unclear. The tenor of the actions, though, seems more protectionist than bid-opening. Ben Thompson, who runs the Stratechery technology analysis newsletter, thinks that the Chinese-American tensions are “the first salvo of what is likely to be one of the biggest stories in tech in 2018”. Last week’s rejection by AT&T really matters to Huawei, because it could drastically curtail its future. It is already banned from selling its network equipment in the US following a 2012 report from the US house intelligence committee (HIC), and had multiple takeovers blocked. But it had hoped to make up some ground in smartphones, which the 2012 report did not block. Though it is the world’s third-biggest smartphone maker and the biggest in China, the world’s biggest market, growth there has slumped with saturation: everyone who wants one has one. But the US, the world’s second-biggest market, was effectively untapped; selling through AT&T, the carrier that originally offered the iPhone in 2007, could have kickstarted a new era and fulfilled Huawei’s ambitions to overtake both Apple and Samsung. Instead, it reaffirmed that the old rules remain in place. Non-carrier sales in the US are less than 10% of the overall 170m a year total, which is part of the reason why Apple and Samsung have 70% of the market: they are sold by all the carriers. The frustration for Huawei may be amplified by the success it has had in the UK. When British officials expressed concern about Huawei providing network equipment for BT, on the basis that it might contain “back doors” that would allow China to carry out remote spying, or even shut systems down, in November 2010 the company set up an office called “The Cell” with oversight from GCHQ where devices and software code could be examined in minute detail for any flaws. So far, that has salved concerns. Meanwhile, Huawei is the second-biggest smartphone supplier in a number of European countries, including Finland, Italy and Spain, where its lower-cost models are seen as better value than Samsung’s. The company is not giving up, though. In a statement after the AT&T decision, Huawei said: “While the Huawei Mate 10 Pro will not be sold by US carriers, we remain committed to this market now and in the future. US customers need a better choice and, as a leader in technology and innovation, Huawei is prepared to fill this need.” Yu addressed the topic directly at that frustrating Mate 10 launch. Standing in front of a slide reading “Something I Want to Share”, he told the audience that in six years the company had gone from nothing in terms of smartphone sales to No 3 globally, with more than 70 million customers. Yu has previously stated his ambition is to overtake Apple and Samsung to become No 1. He will have to hope that the next six years will see Huawei overcome the political obstacles as it overcame technical obstacles. But five years on from the 2012 HIC report, it is clear they are not going away. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.

Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The OnePlus 5T propels the Chinese company into the brave new era of full-screen smartphones, with a new 6in minimal bezel display squeezed into the body of a 5.5in device. The 5T is OnePlus’s fourth phone in two years. Unlike the OnePlus 3 to 3T upgrade in 2016, the internal components for the 5T have mostly stayed the same as those of the OnePlus 5, with the screen and camera the biggest differences. The 6in full HD+ AMOLED screen takes priority, stretching to fill the front of the device, bar the slim bezels at the sides and the relatively small top and bottom panels. It doesn’t look quite as impressively “full screen” as Apple’s iPhone X or Samsung’s Galaxy S8, but the 5T has visibly smaller bezels than most, including the Google Pixel 2 XL. The screen isn’t as high resolution as some competitors, sticking with full HD+ as Huawei did for its Mate 10 Pro, but most won’t care because it clearly benefits battery life. It looks great with good contrast, solid viewing angles and your choice of colour calibration including sRGB and DCI-P3. It looks particularly good with full-screen video. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The fingerprint scanner on the back is one of the best in the business. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The back of the device has a gentle curve, making it feel great to hold, and a minimalist aesthetic in all black, with only the etched logo, fingerprint scanner, dual camera and flash visible. The antenna lines bend round the top and bottom edges in the same way they do on the OnePlus 5. The fingerprint scanner on the back is genuinely great – up there with the best of them in speed and accuracy. The OnePlus 5T feels solid in the hand, but weighing only 162g it is relatively light for a 6in smartphone. Most devices of that size weigh over 170g, including the 174g iPhone X, the 173g Samsung Galaxy S8+, the 175g Google Pixel 2 XL and the 178g Huawei Mate 10 Pro. The 5T is also thinner than most at 7.3mm thick, and is 1.7mm narrower than the Pixel 2 XL, meaning you’re losing nothing in the design despite the phone’s reduced cost. You even get a headphone socket at the bottom, which makes the OnePlus one of the last top-end smartphones to still have one. The only thing missing is water resistance. Where most flagship smartphones have a water resistance rating of IP67 or greater, the 5T lacks such assurances. Specifications Screen: 6in full HD AMOLED (401ppi) Processor: octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 RAM: 6 or 8GB of RAM Storage: 64 or 128GB Operating system: Oxygen OS based on Android 7.1.1 Camera: 16MP + 20MP rear dual camera, 16MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, dual sim, Wi-Fiac, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPS Dimensions: 156.1 x 75 x 7.3mm Weight: 162g Smooth performance and long battery life Facebook Twitter Pinterest The OnePlus 5T has great battery life and charges really fast, thanks to the company’s Dash Charge technology. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The OnePlus 5T has the same specifications as the OnePlus 5 and therefore the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor as used in the majority of top-end smartphones , but with more RAM than most, and options of either 6GB or 8GB. Performance is excellent all round, with a level of sprightliness only seen on Android with the new Pixel 2 XL and Mate 10 Pro with Android Oreo. It’s testament to how much optimisation OnePlus clearly performs with its software, meaning I’m expecting great things once the 5T is updated to Oreo in the first quarter of 2018. If you want Pixel-level smoothness, the 5T is as close as you can get without buying a Google phone. One thing that has improved since the OnePlus 5 is battery life. Despite the larger screen the OnePlus 5T lasted more than 34 hours between charges, meaning I could start using it at 7am and it would make it all way the way through to gone 5pm on the next day. That was while using the OnePlus 5T as my primary device with two sims loaded in it, browsing and using apps for six hours with hundreds of push emails and messages, watching 90 minutes of Netflix, taking around 30 photos and listening to around six hours of music via Bluetooth headphones. Most users will easily be able to go two days between charges. The OnePlus 5T also charges really fast using the company’s proprietary Dash Charge system. Going from zero to 70% charge took just over 33 minutes, which means you’ll get around a day’s charge in well under 30 minutes. Oxygen OS Facebook Twitter Pinterest Oxygen OS comes with lots of little customisation options and gestures. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The OnePlus 5T runs Oxygen OS 4.7, the company’s customised version of Android 7.1.1 Nougat, not the latest Android 8 Oreo that is available on a variety of new top-end smartphones. Overall, Oxygen OS is a refined experience, which is only slightly tweaked from what is considered the standard Android experience. Small additions include the ability to run two versions of the same app side by side, such as two instances of WhatsApp for two phone numbers, which works very well, and more customisation options. Users can switch the order of the navigation keys, change status icons and use a variety of gestures to launch apps or features. Oxygen OS is a very smooth and well implemented version of Android, it’s just a shame the OnePlus 5T isn’t launching with a version based on the improved Android 8 Oreo. Camera Facebook Twitter Pinterest The OnePlus Camera app is much improved since last year, and is now one of the best in the business. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The OnePlus 5T’s dual-camera system is slightly different to that fitted to the 5. Instead of having one camera with a wide-angle lens and another with a telephoto lens, allowing users to get a 2x optical zoom, the 5T’s two cameras both have f/1.7 lenses. The main 12-megapixel camera takes care of most duties, with help from the 20-megapixel secondary camera, which is great for depth effects such as portrait mode. But in low light conditions the phone switches over to the 20-megapixel camera, which combines four pixels into one to improve low-light performance, and for the most part it appears to work. Low light shots were better than the OnePlus 5, with relatively good detail even in photos taken in dim street lighting. It wasn’t quite as good as the Pixel 2 XL at preserving fine detail and minimising blur, but it was fairly close. The camera was also capable of producing excellent shots in better lighting, but the 2x “clear zoom” wasn’t very good, particularly on an overcast day. Pictures looked fine on the phone, but viewed at full resolution on a PC the images lost their crisp detail, an unfortunate consequence of digital zoom. Portrait mode worked well at producing the pleasingly shallow depth of field effect, but it isn’t as good as the best of rival’s implementation, coming unstuck around fine detail such as hair. The 16-megapixel selfie camera is also very good, although it looks a little soft when viewed at full resolution. The camera app is great, with plenty of options including lots of manual control and RAW output. Observations Facebook Twitter Pinterest The optional ambient screen is clear and easy to read even in direct sunlight and didn’t appear to have much of an effect on the excellent battery life. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The USB-C port has quite sharp edges that are uncomfortable on my little finger when held at certain angles It comes with a screen protection pre-installed and a soft plastic case in the box Dash Charge works great, but the 5T requires OnePlus’s power adapter and cable to fast-charge Dual-sim support means you can have two mobile phone numbers and plans at the same time in one phone The alert slider that switches between ring, silent and do not disturb modes is great OnePlus has had its support issues in the past but co-founder Carl Pei has pledged to improve support and software updates for current and new customers Price The OnePlus 5T comes only in “midnight black” and costs £449 for 64GB of storage and 6GB of RAM (buy here) or £499 for 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. For comparison, the 5.8in Galaxy S8 with 64GB of storage costs £689 (buy here), the 6.2in Galaxy S8+ with 64GB costs £779 (buy here), the the 6in Pixel 2 XL with 64GB costs £799 (buy here), the 5.5in Apple iPhone 8 Plus with 64GB costs £799 (buy here) and the 5.8in iPhone X with 64GB costs £999 (buy here). Verdict The OnePlus 5T is a brilliant phone. The large, good-looking 6in screen corrects one of the only flaws with the previous OnePlus 5 to produce a device that is thoroughly on-trend. Its performance is top-notch, the cameras are good, the phone feels great and there’s even a headphone socket. If that wasn’t enough the 34-hour battery life is excellent. All it is missing are wireless charging, water resistance and the latest version of Android. It would be a really good phone costing £600, but priced at just £449 makes the OnePlus 5T an absolute bargain, offering a top-notch experience for considerably less than the competition - you could buy two 5Ts and still have £100 spare for the cost of one iPhone X. Pros: great battery life, good screen, good build, great performance, dual-Sim, good camera, Bluetooth 5 Cons: old version of Android, no IP water resistance rating, screen only FHD+, no wireless charging, no expandable storage, questions around support Facebook Twitter Pinterest The 6in screen is brilliant for watching video.

Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Google’s direct challenger to the iPhone 8 Plus and upcoming iPhone X is the Pixel 2 XL, and you may be blown away by the sheer speed of the thing. The Android-maker has removed the gloves, thrown down the jacket and is seemingly ready for a straight-up fight with Apple, despite the ramifications of inevitably competing directly with Google’s partners such as Samsung and other key Android smartphone manufacturers. Textured body Facebook Twitter Pinterest The aluminium body has a textured coating that keeps fingerprints at bay and aids grip, while the fingerprint scanner is easily reached with your index finger on the back. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The Pixel 2 XL is one of the more unique looking devices in recent memory. It’s available in all black or an attractive black-and-white combo where the body is white and the “visor” top glass section is black. There’s a fairly large camera lens that sticks out a little bit out of the visor, a fingerprint scanner placed on the back where the index finger naturally rests and a small G logo near the bottom. It’s a simple but good-looking design. The front is all glass, with rounded edges and a pair of stereo speakers at the top and bottom. Pressing the power button reveals an elongated 18:9 ratio 6in QHD+ display, which looks great, matching the vibrancy and black levels of the top-end Samsung S8. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the bezels with a relatively large gap between the sides of the device and the screen. At 76.7mm wide, the 6in Pixel 2 XL is 3.3mm wider than the 6.2in Galaxy S8+ but 1.4mm narrower than the 5.5in iPhone 8 Plus. It’s also 2g heavier than the S8+ but 27g lighter than the iPhone 8 Plus, which you can really feel in the hand. In fact, the Pixel 2 XL is one of the easiest large smartphones to hold. The screen and back curve round to flat sides and rounded corners, which provide comfortable in-hand feel and an assured grip. The so called “hybrid coating” on the aluminium body adds texture, feels durable and aids grip too. Specifications Screen: 6in QHD+ pOLED (538ppi) Processor: octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 RAM: 4GB of RAM Storage: 64 or 128GB Operating system: Android 8.0 Oreo Camera: 12.2MP rear camera with OIS, 8MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, Wi-Fi, NFC, eSIM, Bluetooth 5 and GPS Dimensions: 157.9 x 76.7 x 7.9 mm Weight: 175g Battery to go the distance Facebook Twitter Pinterest The USB-C port is in the bottom of the phone for charging and transferring data, but as there’s no headphone jack it also has to double as an audio out using the adapter included. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The Pixel 2 XL has all the high-end hardware you might expect in a 2017 flagship phone: Qualcomm’s top-of-the-line Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of memory, 64GB or more of storage and a fairly large, fast-charging battery. But it’s clear that not all Android smartphones are born equal. The Pixel 2 XL is the fastest-feeling smartphone I’ve ever used. Switching between apps using a double-tap on the overview button is instant. Apps spring into action. The fingerprint scanner on the back is super quick. Even big, intensive games load faster than any other Android device; it’s really quite impressive. Battery life is also good. I easily got a full day of use out of the Pixel 2 XL. Taking lots of photos, watching videos, receiving loads of emails and message notifications, browsing the internet over a mix of wifi and 4G, as well as a couple of hours of listening to music via Bluetooth headphones and quick spot of gaming, I would get to bed with at least 40% battery left, for a total of around 31 hours battery life. The battery would drop by only 1% in eight hours overnight, compared to around 4% from the best of the competition, which was impressive. Google’s Oreo and software optimisations for the Pixel 2 XL focused on battery life clearly work. I would expect those who only use their smartphones intermittently throughout the day to see much better battery life compared to most of the competition, easily reaching two days. A full charge takes around 100 minutes using a fast USB-C Power Delivery charger (one is included in the box, but any that charge a computer will do too). Charging the first 40% took around 30 minutes, which would last at least half a day. Android Oreo with Pixel additions Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hook up your own phone with the included cable or the cable that came with it and the USB-to-USB-C adapter to transfer your data. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The Pixel 2 XL is one of the first new smartphones to ship with the latest iteration of Android 8 Oreo, which is the most refined version yet. Most of the changes are under the hood, helping to prolong battery life and preserve snappy performance. Google also now has plenty of Pixel-specific features. The most obvious is the tighter integration of Google Assistant into the device. The home screen now has the Google search bar at the bottom and an intelligent widget at the top of the screen that displays the date, upcoming calendar appointments, traffic conditions and the weather. Google says this top widget will get smarter as time goes on with new features to be added with updates, but users cannot remove it – an unusual and possibly controversial situation for an Android device, which normally pride themselves on the ability to customise pretty much everything. It’s clear that Google has spent a lot of time optimising all the various bits and pieces of Android and the Pixel software. The raw feeling of speed is one element, but it also all feels incredibly smooth. Animations are fast but highly detailed and fluid. There’s a level of consistency and performance that is difficult to find away from Apple’s iOS, which is exactly what Google – as the Android maker – should be able to do, and needs to do to compete with the iPhone. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Now Playing feature identifies music in the background and shows you the artist and track on the ambient display. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The other big element of the Pixel 2 XL over most other smartphones is the increasing level of smarts being built into the device. Google is baking machine-learning or AI directly into the device in the form of dedicated chips and software, performing functions that would usually require an internet connection the cloud. The Pixel 2 XL’s fun little Now Playing feature is a good example. It performs like the app Shazam, identifying tracks and artists from music playing around you, but does so locally using a built-in updating database of around 100,000 songs. It happens in the background popping up as a small notification at the bottom of the always-on display and in the notification shade should you wish to add that track to your Spotify or similar library. Google says this is just the beginning of its local AI plans, which should be both faster and help preserve privacy as nothing is sent to a server. The Pixel also has pressure-sensitive sides, like the HTC U11. Squeeze the bottom of the phone and it’ll launch Google Assistant even when the screen is off. To my British sensibilities, it’s a much better way of getting to the Google Assistant than the awkward wake word “OK Google”. Camera Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Simply brilliant’ … the 12.2-megapixel rear camera on the Pixel 2 XL. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The 12.2-megapixel rear camera on the Pixel 2 XL is simply brilliant, producing some of the best photos I’ve ever captured using a smartphone, which are full of detail, even in the dark areas of otherwise bright scenes. Low light performance is also excellent, making just about any off-the-cuff photo look good. There aren’t any real manual controls, with focus and exposure lock or compensation about it, but that’s absolutely fine for most people. The eight-megapixel selfie camera is also the best in the business, capturing more detail and with better lighting than any other I have tried. Some may find the level of detail a little unflattering, capturing anything and everything including patches of dry skin and wrinkles, but they can always be smoothed out after the fact. Google offers a mode that helps smooth skin for selfies, which worked quite well without making people look like they’re wearing makeup applied with a trowel. The motion stills – which are essentially Google’s version of Apple’s Live Photos – were surprisingly good, just capturing interesting elements of motion. It’s still a bit of a gimmick but caught a few surprises in group photos and selfies here and there. Google has developed a version of the popular Portrait Mode that does not require a dual camera setup like the competition. Instead Google uses the dual-pixel system of a single camera to gain depth information, which means it works on both the rear and selfie cameras. It uses depth-sensing to identify the subject and artificially blur the background for a pleasing bokeh effect, and was easily as good as Apple’s system on the iPhone 8 Plus just without the 2x zoom, only tripping up on glass objects. It also handled fine detail such as wisps of hair better than most others. Observations Facebook Twitter Pinterest Squeeze to launch Google Assistant.

For comparison, the 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S8+ costs around £680 with 64GB of storage (£779 at launch), the 5.8in Galaxy S8 with 64GB costs under £540 (£689 at launch), the 6.3in Galaxy Note 8 with 64GB costs under £820 (£869 at launch), the 5.5in OnePlus 5 with 64GB costs £449 and the 5.5in iPhone 8 Plus with 64GB costs £799. Apple’s upcoming 5.8in iPhone X with 64GB of storage will cost £999. Verdict There is no question that the Google Pixel 2 XL is the best Android experience money can buy. It is the fastest-feeling, slickest and smoothest Android has ever been, putting it well on par with the quality of iOS. The Pixel 2 XL also one of the more interesting looking devices, but does not push the boundaries of phone design quite like the minimal bezels of the Samsung Galaxy S8. That’s not to say it looks like a phone from 2016 or earlier, but it doesn’t quite have the same feeling when you hit the power button and you see the screen doesn’t completely fill the front. The lack of a headphone socket and wireless charging is disappointing. The battery life is great, the camera is absolutely fantastic, the screen looks good, the front-facing speakers are loud and crisp, and the textured body is easy to grip. As an overall package the Google Pixel 2 XL is the best big smartphone of the moment, but I’m not sure it’ll be enough to tempt iPhone users away from Apple. It’s quite expensive, but is still a full £200 cheaper than the upcoming iPhone X, and similar to Samsung’s Galaxy S8+. If you were contemplating a big top-end smartphone, the Pixel 2 XL should be in your top three at least, which should have everyone but Samsung and Apple very worried. Pros: very fast, long battery life, great screen, squeezable sides, latest version of Android and rapid updates, interesting built-in AI, water resistant, fantastic camera, unlimited photo and video backup Cons: expensive, no expandable storage or removable battery, no headphone jack, no wireless charging Facebook Twitter Pinterest The always-on ambient display is easy to read even outdoors.

Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Following the Note 7 debacle, Samsung really needs a home run to keep its lead in the smartphone market. Is the almost all-screen Galaxy S8 it? It seems so. The Galaxy S8 (find here) is arguably the best improvement in smartphone design in years and the biggest step forward to the holy grail of an all-screen phone. The S8 has curved screens like last year’s model, but now the top and bottom bezels of the phone are much smaller, measuring 9mm from the very top of the device and just over 7mm from the bottom, giving it a screen-to-body ratio of 83%. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The screen takes up almost all of the front of the S8. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The long and narrow 5.8in QHD+ “infinity” screen provides the big-screen experience in a body practically the same width as, and only a little taller than, Apple’s 4.7in iPhone 7. The S8’s body is narrow at just 68.1mm wide, which is 9.8mm narrower than the 77.9mm wide iPhone 7 Plus, 7.6mm narrower than the 75.7mm Google Pixel XL and 4.5mm narrower than last year’s 72.6mm S7 Edge, and therefore a lot more manageable to use than the competition. Samsung is the market leader in screen technology, and the S8 has the company’s best smartphone display to date. It’s simply beautiful, with rich colours, inky blacks, excellent viewing angles and a surprisingly large brightness range. It is bright enough to see in direct sunlight but will also go very dim to make viewing the screen at night much less dazzling. Out of the box the display is set to the equivalent of full HD resolution, despite the fact that the screen is capable of displaying resolutions up to QHD+. Users can opt for QHD+, FHD+ or even a 720p equivalent (in theory the higher the resolution the shorter the battery life but the crisper the display). The S8 is Samsung’s most tactile phone to date. The glass back, curved edges and polished metal sides feel great. Samsung’s usual home, back and overview capacitive buttons are gone, instead replaced with software navigation keys. The place on the screen where the home button is displayed is pressure sensitive, acting both as a software button and a hardware button in one. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The softkey home button can be displayed all the time or just when the screen is on. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Pressing harder on the home button while the device is in standby, for instance, can be set to wake up the phone, while the button can be deactivated while playing a game unless hard-pressed to avoid accidental activation. It works well. The camera is flush with the body – no camera bump or wedge-shape needed – with a small raised bezel to help protect the lens. The S8 is also water resistant to depths of 1.5m for 30 minutes with an IP68 rating, and Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5, which should hopefully make both front and back more scratch resistant. Specifications Screen: 5.8in quad HD+ AMOLED (570ppi) Processor: octa-core Samsung Exynos 8895 or octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 RAM: 4GB of RAM Storage: 64GB + microSD card Operating system: Android 7.0 with TouchWiz Camera: 12MP rear camera with OIS, 8MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, Wi-Fi, NFC, wireless charging, Bluetooth 5, GPS and Iris sensor Dimensions: 148.9 x 68.1 x 8 mm Weight: 155g Future-proofed Facebook Twitter Pinterest The glass back feels great in the hand and less slippery than some other glass-backed devices. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian I tested the European Exynos 8895 version of the Galaxy S8. US Galaxy S8 buyers will get a version that uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 instead. The Galaxy S8 is a highly capable, fast phone, with snappy performance across the board, particularly when loading of large amounts of data. In Gameloft’s Nova Legacy each level loaded in about half the time on the S8 than the Pixel XL, and once playing the game the S8 stayed cool and consumed noticeably less battery. Call and data connectivity were excellent throughout, and yes, there’s a headphone socket. The S8 is one of the most future-proofed smartphones available. It is one of the few to support the new cat 9 LTE – the fastest of 4G technologies currently available only in large urban areas and only through EE – but it also supports the brand new Bluetooth 5.0 standard, which will provide much more advanced and robust support for wireless headphones among other things. Bluetooth 5.0 headphones won’t be available in the mass market for a while. In the meantime the S8 uses the more advanced Bluetooth chip to send audio to two different Bluetooth devices simultaneously, making headphone sharing wireless. Using it as my primary device, browsing and using apps for four hours with hundreds of push emails, 60 minutes of gaming, and listening to around five hours of music via Bluetooth headphones, the Galaxy S8 lasted just over 24 hours with the screen set to QHD+ and the always-on display (AOD) active and no power-saving modes activated. Setting the screen to FHD+ and turning off AOD the S8 managed to make it just over 25 hours between charges. Wireless charging worked well overnight on a 5W pad built into a piece of furniture, but faster wireless chargers are available. Quick charging via the USB-C cable and the Samsung power adapter that comes with the phone fully charged the it in just over 90 minutes, which isn’t the fastest available but isn’t exactly slow. The S8 only supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 2.0, not the latest version 3.0 or the more universal USB-PD (power delivery), which is disappointing. TouchWiz Facebook Twitter Pinterest Put the box over the video you want to keep on top and let Snap window do the rest. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Samsung devices run a modified version of Android called TouchWiz. The S8 runs Android 7.0 Nougat, not the latest 7.1, and with a series of customisations to both the look and operation of Android. Over the last few versions, TouchWiz has improved greatly from an overbearing, gimmick and bug-filled mess to something perfectly acceptable. The version based on Android 7 running on the S8 called “Grace UX” is actually good, which is something I never thought I’d say about TouchWiz. TouchWiz is filled with useful additions and little options that can tweak the device to behave the way you want that aren’t available with standard Android. For instance, users can choose to have the navigation keys at the bottom of the screen either in standard Android configuration (back, home then recently used apps) or Samsung’s reversed configuration with the back button on the right. You can also change the colour, make the home button skip the lockscreen entirely and choose whether it is displayed all the time or not. The number of icons you can fit on the homescreen can be changed and you can move multiple icons around at the same time and choose whether they have borders around them or not. You can have an app drawer, and change whether or not to show a button to get to it, or see it behave like iOS with all apps on the homescreen. There’s full theme support too, with many to chose from. One of the most useful features is called Snap window, which essentially allows you to place a video at the top of any other content in a split-screen layout by highlighting the part of the screen that contains the video in whichever app you’re playing it in. It feels a bit of a hack, but is much better than most other implementations that do the same job on Android. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Full-screen video looks brilliant on the display. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian A great addition – carried over from from the ill-fated Note 7 – is instant gif making. Accessed from the smart select edge panel, simply tap the gif button, place the box over whichever video you want to turn into a gif, hit record and play the video to produce an instant gif. It’s the sole reason to use the edge panel. Overall, TouchWiz on the Galaxy S8 is a polished, feature-rich and highly customisable operating system, which isn’t burdened with gimmicks. The only issue might be with the rate at which Samsung updates the version of Android. It’s already not running on the latest version and the company is not known for its rapid version updates. Bixby The S8 is the first device to come with Samsung’s new smart assistant Bixby. It has its own dedicated button on the side and comes in three parts. The first is a Google Now-esque set of cards for displaying a few widgets, reminders, the weather, steps and the social news aggregator Upday. The second is object recognition like Google Goggles. The third is a voice assistant, which isn’t available yet but is set to be available in the US in the spring, with other countries including the UK at a later date. The trouble is Bixby isn’t very good. Sure, it can point me in the direction of Amazon to buy more Nature Valley bars, or capture text from an image, but Upday I found more annoying than useful and the Spotify widget is easier to activate from the notification shade. At the moment Bixby is a poor duplication of Google Assistant’s feed, which is also built into the S8. Thankfully you can turn it off and safely ignore it, but you can’t use that extra button for anything else, yet. At least I haven’t activated Bixby by accident. Biometrics Facebook Twitter Pinterest The S8 stares into your eyes to unlock via the iris scanner. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The S8 comes with the usual fingerprint scanner, but this time it’s placed on the back up next to the camera. It’s not an idea placement, but it is about the same distance up the back as fingerprint scanners placed on the back of some big-screen smartphones. I found it OK to reach it, and relatively accurate and fast to unlock the device, but I put fingerprints all over the camera lens by accident all the time. It’s not the best, but it’s not terrible either. On the front you also have an iris scanner, which scans both or either of your irises in the same way the Note 7 did. If you get your eyes lined up properly it can work almost instantaneously, but it’s faster and more reliable to use the fingerprint scanner. The only time I found it useful was when the phone was on the desk and I didn’t want to pick it up to unlock it. Camera Facebook Twitter Pinterest The camera app’s floating shutter button and slide-to-zoom functionality are small but useful features. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The S8’s camera is very similar to the one fitted to last year’s Galaxy S7 Edge. Its f/1.7 lens is one of the fastest on the market and as such lets in more light than most. Combined with large, 1.4um pixels on the 12-megapixel sensor, the S8’s low-light performance is arguably the best available. It focused, shot and captured dark scenes better than the Google Pixel XL, but the S8’s HDR function is not quite as good as Google’s HDR+. The S8 captures excellent images in most conditions and it is a slightly better camera than last year’s S7 Edge. The camera app is great, with enough options and manual controls to keep most people happy, and has a new optional floating camera button that can be placed anywhere on the screen. It makes taking photos in landscape a lot easier with one hand. The front-facing selfie camera is excellent, capturing detailed, well balanced photos even in poor light. It also comes with some beautification features, which work better than most without turning your face into a painting. Observations Facebook Twitter Pinterest After a good week’s worth of use, there isn’t a mark on the polished metal sides, but I daren’t drop it. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The highly polished finish of the black metal edges seems relatively scratch resistant and has yet to show any signs of wear There’s a notification LED that can be set to flash for various events Gaming on the extra-wide screen is great, with touchscreen controls meaning your fingers moved much further away from the action usually taking place in the middle of the screen The S8 supports HDR video including that from Amazon Video There’s a heart-rate sensor on the back next to the camera You can play the sound from two apps to two different devices at the same time, such as music to a Bluetooth speaker and game audio through the built-in speaker Face recognition is also built-in, but it’s easier to fool than the iris scanner or fingerprint scanner The secure folder allows you to keep certain apps or duplicates of apps in a password or biometrically secured folder, handy for work-specific versions of apps you might want to use Palm rejection is much better than the S7 Edge and not once did touching the sides cause issues recognising taps or typing Price The Samsung Galaxy S8 costs £689 (buy here) with 64GB of storage. It comes in black or grey and is due to ship 28 April. For comparison, Google’s Pixel XL costs £719 with 32GB of storage, Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus costs £719 with 32GB of storage, the LG G6 costs £649 with 32GB of storage, the OnePlus 3T costs £399 with 64GB of storage and the Huawei P10 Plus costs £649 with 128GB of storage. Verdict The Samsung Galaxy S8 is the best smartphone available, full stop. It has raised the bar for top-end smartphone design, is one of the most future-proofed phones you can buy and squeezes a large selection of cutting-edge technology into a consumer-friendly package that anyone can use. Nothing is perfect, of course: the fingerprint scanner could be positioned better, the battery could last longer, the pace of software updates is questionable and the lack of USB-PD is disappointing. But what you get is a brilliant, exciting smartphone that’s beautiful. It feels like you’re holding the future. Pros: 64GB + microSD card slot, wireless charging, IP68, brilliant screen, tiny body, great camera, iris scanner, 24-hour battery, pressure-sensitive screen, notification LED Cons: fixed battery, only Android 7.0, no USB-PD, fingerprint scanner placement not ideal Facebook Twitter Pinterest No camera bump to be see, just a small bezel to protect the lens and mark out the fingerprint sensor.

Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The iPhone X is Apple’s most important – and most expensive – new smartphone in four years, bringing with it a significant change to the design, dumping the home button to usher in a full-screen experience. Thankfully, Apple nailed it. After four years of the company recycling the design of the iPhone 6, the iPhone X is a breath of fresh air. The beautiful OLED screen takes up pretty much the whole front of the device. It’s one of the best displays I’ve ever seen on a smartphone, and while it’s not quite as bezel free at the sides as Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Note 8 devices, it’s a giant leap forward for Apple. Two concessions were made for the all-screen design. The most obvious is that there is no home button, axed after a decade of service. You might miss it if you have muscle memory from mashing the button every two minutes, but I don’t. There’s also no Touch ID fingerprint scanner, as it has been replaced with Face ID facial recognition technology – more on that later. To get back to the home screen you swipe up from a line at the very bottom of the screen, which feels much more fluid and engaging than hitting a button. You’re meant to swipe up and hold to get to the stack of recently used apps, but I found it quicker and more reliable to use the BlackBerry OS 10-esque swipe up and right (or left) gesture. The second concession is equally controversial – the so-called notch. At the top of the screen there’s a cutout in the display that houses the earpiece speaker, the selfie camera and various sensors for the TrueDepth camera system that facilitates Face ID. Those bits have to be there somewhere; most manufacturers just have a piece of the phone’s body extend left to right, squaring off the screen, which I think is a better compromise. It’s something people will either straight-up hate, or simply not notice most of the time. My money is on the latter, even though it does look a little bit stupid when watching full-screen video. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The iPhone 8 on the left, iPhone X in the middle and iPhone 8 Plus on the right. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The back of the phone is glass, like the iPhone 8 Plus but with a more pronounced vertically-oriented camera lump. Its polished stainless steel frame feels harder than the aluminium used for the previous iPhones, and at 174g the phone weighs quite a lot for its size. The 5.8in Samsung Galaxy S8 weighs 19g less, but the iPhone X is still significantly lighter than the 202g 5.5in iPhone 8 Plus. No matter how solid it feels, you’ll need a case. No matter how durable Apple says its glass is, glass is still glass and breaks on impact with the ground, as drop tests show. It’s a shame because the iPhone X is genuinely one of the nicest smartphones to hold. One thing that might surprise iPhone users is just how small the iPhone X is despite its 5.8in screen. At 143.6mm long, the iPhone X is 5.2mm taller than the iPhone 8 but a full 14.8mm shorter than the iPhone 8 Plus. At 70.9mm wide the iPhone X is only 3.6mm bigger than the iPhone 8, and is 7.2mm narrower than the iPhone 8 Plus, with its smaller, 5.5in screen. That’s the difference between being able to comfortably hold and use it with one hand or being on the verge of dropping it all the time. For a non-iPhone comparison, Samsung’s Galaxy S8 is 2.8mm narrower but 5.3mm taller than the iPhone X with the same sized screen when measured diagonally. Specifications Screen: 5.8in Super Retina HD (OLED) (458ppi) Processor: Apple A11 Bionic RAM: 3GB of RAM Storage: 64 or 256GB Operating system: iOS 11 Camera: Dual 12MP rear cameras with OIS, 7MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, Wi-Fiac, NFC, Bluetooth 5, Lightning and GPS Dimensions: 143.6 x 70.9 x 7.7 mm Weight: 174g More than a day’s battery Facebook Twitter Pinterest The camera lump on the glass back is quite pronounced. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The iPhone X has the same A11 Bionic processor and amount of memory as the iPhone 8 Plus and performs just as well, and as fast and fluid as you should expect for an expensive, top-of-the-line smartphone. The iPhone X’s battery lasts almost as long as the iPhone 8 Plus too. Using it as my primary device with hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, around five hours listening to music on Bluetooth headphones, an hour of Netflix, a quick game and around 10 or so photos shot a day, the iPhone X lasted just under 30 hours between charges. That meant it would last from 7am till around lunchtime on the second day. Most users will see at least a day’s battery out of it when new, and hopefully still a day when a year or so old and the battery has lost a little of its capacity. The iPhone X can fast-charge from a USB-C power adapter, but like the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus one isn’t included in the box. Wireless charging works great, particularly when sitting at a desk or overnight on a bedside table, but isn’t as fast as a cable. Face ID Facebook Twitter Pinterest The notch at the top of the screen houses the technology needed for the face recognition, as well as the selfie camera and earpiece speaker. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The big new feature for the iPhone X is Face ID – Apple’s facial-recognition system that uses an infrared camera to map your face with the help of a dot projector and infrared light. As the iPhone X has no fingerprint scanner, Face ID is the only biometric security system available for unlocking the smartphone and its apps or authenticating payments. My experience with even the best facial-recognition systems, such as those on Microsoft’s Surface computers, made me sceptical as to whether Face ID would work well enough to replace the tried and trusted fingerprint scanner. I was genuinely surprised at how well it works. In the day-to-day rush of life, not once did it fail to recognise me and open up. Even when I borrowed some strong prescription glasses it recognised me (I don’t wear glasses). It struggled with polarised sunglasses, but that’s not really a problem for most of the year in the UK, although it might be in sunnier climes. After registering your face, you unlock the phone by looking at it and swiping up. It works just about any position and distance at which you would normally hold and interact with your phone, as long as it’s within 45 degrees of the vertical and horizontal – it’ll work OK on a desk out in front of you, but it doesn’t work if you’re trying to unlock it in landscape. It has to be able to see your eyes and mouth, so avoid posing like The Thinker. Any apps that use Touch ID automatically support Face ID, even if they haven’t been updated. iOS 11 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Control centre on the iPhone X is pulled down from the top right. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The iPhone X runs Apple’s latest software, iOS 11.1 and for the most part it is exactly the same as iOS running on any other modern iPhone, including the iPhone 8. Beyond the disappearing home button, there are a few other differences from regular iOS. The keyboard doesn’t sit right at the bottom of the screen, floating about the width of my little finger up the screen with a large grey area below. The notch at the top means that the status bar doesn’t really exist anymore. The time and location services indicator is now on the left, and the battery, wifi and cellular signal indicator sit on the right. But there’s no space for icons such as the rotation lock, Bluetooth, alarm and battery percentage icons because of the notch. I miss the do not disturb icon the most – I keep missing messages and calls because I’ve forgotten to turn off DND in the morning without a visual reminder. Status icons still exist, but they’re tucked away in the new control centre panel, which is now pulled down from the top right edge of the screen. Some might struggle to reach control centre up there, but it’s much more like Android’s version, which has been under the notification shade at the top of the screen for years. Pulling down anywhere just left of the cellular signal status reveals notifications. Camera Facebook Twitter Pinterest The dual camera system on the back provides a two-times zoom and depth-sensing technology for various portrait modes. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The iPhone X has a similar dual-camera system to the iPhone 8 Plus, except that the two cameras are arranged vertically on the back. Both cameras have 12-megapixel sensors. The wide-angle camera has an f/1.8 lens, the other “telephoto” camera has an f/2.4, an improvement on the f/2.8 one fitted to the iPhone 8 Plus. Results are pretty similar to the iPhone 8 Plus, meaning photos are detailed, well coloured and close to the best in the business. The iPhone X’s telephoto camera has slightly better low-light performance, which is welcome. Also new is Portrait Lighting mode, which recognises faces and allows you to simulate different lighting effects as well as adding an artificial shallow depth of field with pleasing bokeh. It’s a fun gimmick I found myself larking around with, rather than using to produce meaningful shots. The TrueDepth system enables Portrait modes for one of the best selfie cameras in the business, with good detail and colour. I found Portrait Lighting, particularly the Stage Light and Mono modes, to struggle with artefacts and gaping around the ears and hair in selfies, though. The depth-sensing selfie camera can also be used to create what Apple calls Animoji, which I found just a tad creepy, but some people might find it fun to replicate their facial expressions on the head of a fox or alien. Observations The screen’s 19.5:9 ratio makes it one of the most elongated displays on the market; most competitors use an 18:9 ratio, making them wider for the same length The screen’s colours cool towards blue when viewed off angle – a normal trait for OLED displays Not all apps have been updated to fill the screen, meaning apps such as Signal, Gmail, Spotify, Google Maps, etc have massive black bars at the top and bottom of the screen Siri is now activated by a long press of the elongated power button To turn off the phone you have to hold the power and volume buttons You have to force press the buttons on the home screen for the camera and the flash, but it’s really not obvious When speaking, say iPhone 10, not ex Price The iPhone X costs £999 for 64GB of storage (buy here) or £1,149 for 256GB of storage (buy here) and comes in either silver or black . For comparison, the 5.8in Galaxy S8 with 64GB of storage costs £689 (buy here), the 6.3in Galaxy Note 8 with 64GB costs £869 (buy here), the 5in Google Pixel 2 costs £629 with 64GB (buy here), the 6in Pixel 2 XL with 64GB costs £799 (buy here), the 5.5in OnePlus 5 with 64GB costs £449 (buy here), the 5.5in iPhone 8 Plus with 64GB costs £799 (buy here) and the 4.7in iPhone 8 with 64GB of storage costs £699 (buy here). Verdict The iPhone X is without a doubt the best iPhone Apple has ever made, and it represents a much needed leap forward in design for the company. It still runs the same apps as other iPhones and has the same camera on the back and the same processor and memory as the iPhone 8 Plus. But by ditching the home button, extending the screen to fill the front and introducing Face ID that actually works, it feels so much more modern. The irony is that the iPhone X is the best version of the iPhone for defectors from Android, as many of the changes will feel more familiar to them. Die-hard iPhone users might find some of the changes quite jarring. It’s not perfect: the notch can be annoying, discovery of features on the phone is still atrocious, and it’s difficult to believe any smartphone is worth £999, particularly when the best of the competition can be had for almost half that. But if you’re looking for an iPhone, can stomach splashing a grand on a phone or were already eyeing up the iPhone 8 Plus, this is the iPhone for you. The iPhone X is simply great. Pros: brilliant screen, all-screen design, great camera, good battery life, water resistant, wireless charging, Face ID Cons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, glass will break if dropped, very expensive, no expandable storage or removable battery, no fast charger in the box, the notch Facebook Twitter Pinterest All keyboard, including Google’s Gboard and Apple’s built-in keyboard have a grey padding between the spacebar and the bottom of the screen.

Voice-control devices that can play music, answer questions and buy goods are one of the hottest gifts this Christmas. Here’s what they can do – and our pick of the best buys Samuel Gibbs Fri 1 Dec 2017 11.38 GMT Last modified on Thu 11 Jan 2018 10.32 GMT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close The Amazon Echo has good audio quality and a solid feature set. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Smart speakers are set to be the hottest Christmas gift this year. On Black Friday, Amazon dropped the price of its core Echo product to £79 (it is back up to £90 now), while Google slashed the cost of its Home device from £129 to £77.50 at most outlets (it is also back up now). Meanwhile, Apple is promising to launch its version, HomePod, although the price point is rumoured to be significantly higher. With the pre-Christmas launch of the Echo Show, which ups Alexa’s game with a built-in screen, are they the next must-have device? A simple voice command can fill your room with music – and change tunes whenever you wish. They will answer questions on a vast range of topics, set alarms, tell you the weather and what your commute holds in store. Some can order almost any goods over the internet for delivery within hours or days. Hooked up with other devices, they turn lights on and off and control the heating. But they have also been accused of making fake purchases and snooping on your conversations. Amazon Echo Show review: smart speaker with a screen has great potential Read more Your questions answered What are they? Essentially internet-connected speakers with built-in artificial intelligence in the form of voice assistants, like those on most smartphones. The two biggest players are Amazon, whose Echo uses its Alexa voice assistant, and Google, whose Home speaker uses its Assistant voice recognition system. Apple’s HomePod, using its well-established Siri voice assistant, was scheduled for launch in December, but the date has slipped to early next year. How do they work? The built-in microphones listen for a wake-up word. Saying “Alexa” to Amazon’s speaker or “Hey, Google” to Google’s devices wakes them up so they start listening to you. From that moment they send everything you say to a server to interpret what you’re saying and reply with an answer, action or similar. It all happens in a split second over wifi. What can they do? Any number of voice-related tasks, but most people use them to play music by simply asking for a track, artist or album; answer general knowledge questions; and to set timers, alarms and, if you have gone to the trouble of setting it up, to control smart home devices such as smart lights. They can also can plug into your calendar to let you know what your day looks like. They will also mostly replace a digital radio, accessing any radio station that plays via the web. Are they always listening? Yes, unless muted. The microphones are always listening out for the wake word. What are they good at? They’re best at performing activities when your hands are otherwise occupied. Setting timers in the kitchen while your hands are covered in flour; playing a bit of music and then skipping the track or turning up or down the volume when amusing a toddler; or simply settling arguments on who scored the winning goal in the cup final – without having to get out your phone. It should work on even quite slow broadband connections – although at times if you are listening to music, it may drop out on very slow connections. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Google Home has strong voice recognition. Photograph: Google What’s the difference between Alexa and Google Assistant? Broadly speaking they perform very similarly. Alexa has a greater number of integrations with other apps from third-parties, such as National Rail, the Guardian, Ocado or Uber. Google Assistant has slightly better natural language understanding, particularly if you make a mess of your question. It also has a larger general knowledge database with the ability to fall back to reading out Google search results for those obscure queries. You are also told where the result came from, leaving it up to you to decide whether you trust the source. Will they snoop on us? The devices listen out for your wake command, carry out the instruction, then shut off. However, any command is recorded to your account for posterity unless you delete it. There is no evidence that the devices are listening into general conversations then using the information commercially. Can I – or my kids – buy things with them? It’s possible. Alexa can buy goods from Amazon via voice using the site’s one-click settings of your default payment and delivery details, so yes your children can instruct it to buy, say, Xbox games. But you can turn off purchasing at the outset to avoid this happening. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Sonos One has excellent sound, but lacks some standard features available to the Echo. Photograph: Sonos Do I need extra subscriptions? No. To use Alexa you need an Amazon account, but you don’t need to be a Prime subscriber. For Google’s Assistant you need a Google account, but not a subscription to any of Google’s paid-for services. Which music services do they support? Alexa supports Amazon Music, both the 2m-song library version bundled with Prime membership (£79 a year) and the full 40m-song library Music Unlimited at £3.99 a month with an Echo. You can add Spotify, TuneIn and Radioplayer. Google Assistant will play your own uploaded music library for free (from your Google Play account), plus paid-for services such as Spotify. Google Play Access All Areas is £9.99 a month. Alternatively, you can stream music via Bluetooth from a phone, tablet or computer. Do they make voice calls? In the UK Alexa can call Amazon’s range of Echo speakers, as well as the Alexa app on a smartphone owned by you or your friends. You both need to have set up this function. Google Assistant can currently only place calls in the US or Canada. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Apple HomePod has no official launch date as yet. Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images Which should I buy? Each device has its advantages, but we reckon that the Amazon Echo is the best all-rounder. Amazon Echo Price £90 but look out for deals. It has good audio quality, an excellent ability to hear you over noise, and a solid feature set. Google Home Price: £129 but was widely discounted to £77.50 for Black Friday. If you can get it for that price or less, then it becomes a contender. Sound quality is poorer than the Echo, but Google’s voice recognition is better. Google Home Mini Price: £49 If you’re looking for something to just answer general knowledge questions – who starred in a film or scored the winning goal – it’s the best bet, but it’s not great as a music speaker. Apple HomePod Price: Unknown No official launch date yet, but it could be early 2018 and is rumoured to be around the £300 mark. Apple will be keen to offer the highest quality music experience. But its Siri voice assistant is widely regarded as weak compared to Alexa and Google Assistant. Sonos One Price £199 The best-sounding smart speaker to date has Alexa integrated into it, and is promised to receive Google Assistant-support next year, but lacks some standard features available to the Echo such as daily briefings and some music features. Amazon Echo Dot Price: £50 The smarts of Alexa condensed into a smaller puck-sized device with a small speaker, but audio output options to connect up external speakers, making it good for adding Alexa to existing kit.

Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Amazon’s new top-end e-reader is now water resistant, but is the all aluminium Kindle Oasis still the luxury option to buy? While the original Kindle Oasis was a big step forward in e-reader design, the 2017 Oasis is more of a refinement with fewer of the compromises made last year for fit and form. The new model has a similar asymmetric shape to its predecessor, with one thicker side having page-turn buttons, a power button and the microUSB charging port. The other, thinner side contains the new, larger 7in E-ink screen, which is an inch bigger than the last model and the biggest fitted to a Kindle since the 9.7in DX line, which was discontinued in 2013. Where the 2016 Oasis had a small battery in the reader itself and a larger battery in the case, which charged the internal battery, the new Oasis has a larger battery built-in, capable of “six weeks of reading” – enough to read around two 350-page novels even at my slow pace. It’s a more elegant solution, but the larger battery and bigger screen mean the body of the Oasis now weighs 63g more, at 194g. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The aluminium back of the new Kindle Oasis looks and feels nice. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian While it is no longer feather-light, it’s not heavy either, and the solid aluminium body feels more sturdy, meaning I’m less worried about it breaking in a bag. You also have to hold it differently to be able to still hit both page turn buttons, grasping it halfway up the side with your fingers tucked against the ridge on the back rather than down by the bottom corner. The buttons are still excellent and it’s still comfortable to hold for extended periods. While it’s more difficult to fit in a pocket, I appreciated the bigger display, which could fit more text on one page, meaning fewer page turns were required per chapter. It’s still as beautifully crisp and easy to read, and now has automatic front-light adjustment. Specifications Screen: 7in Paperwhite with frontlight (300ppi) Storage: 8/32GB Dimensions: 159 x 141 x 8.3mm (3.4mm at thinnest point) Weight: 194g Rated battery life: 6 weeks reading 30 minutes a day Native format support: Kindle (AZW/AZW3), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC Water resistance and audiobooks Facebook Twitter Pinterest Audible audiobook playback is just a button-press away and syncs to the position in the ebook if you own both. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Other than the bigger screen, the two new standout features for the 2017 Oasis are Audible audiobook integration and water resistance, a first for the Kindle line and a feature rivals have had for years. It will survive up to an hour in up to 2m of fresh water, which means trips to the beach or the pool are a bit safer, although don’t expect it to float. You can slot a case into the thinner section on the back, which will hold it on by magnets and can stand the Kindle up on a desk. I tried a fabric case, which is water safe and quite nice, but doesn’t feel as luxurious as the leather cover included with the 2016 Oasis (leather versions are available for a higher price than the fabric model). Audiobooks are nothing new, but what the new Oasis can do is sync your reading positions across Audible books and ebooks. If you have bought both the ebook and the audiobook you can seamlessly switch between the two by using a pair of Bluetooth headphones or a speaker connected to the Oasis – there’s no headphone socket. I hit play on the audiobook as I leave work to listen to while walking to the station. Once seated on the train, I pull out the Oasis and start reading rather than listening. The sync happens between complete pages, so you have to find the last word that was uttered on the page. Once I pull in at the station I hit the button, switch to the audiobook and hit play again, walking home. I found it delightful, working and syncing well, but it’s expensive as you have to essentially buy the book twice and you can’t side-load audiobooks from other sources. If you own one but not the other, Amazon discounts the other format, from £2.99 for an audiobook. It won’t show the text of the book when you listen to the audiobook, so it won’t work as a read-along system for kids. You also end up with the narrator’s version of characters entering into your reading of the book, which some will like but others will feel is imposing. Observations Facebook Twitter Pinterest There are plenty of options to customise the look and structure of text. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The 2017 Kindle Oasis is significantly faster in operation than the previous version There are plenty of formatting, typeface, size and display settings The magnetic cover switches the Kindle on or off, but it’s a shame one isn’t included in the box The Oasis is readable in pretty much any light, including very bright sunlight thanks to it’s E-ink screen The screen has the same 300ppi pixel density as the Kindle Paperwhite, Voyage and 2016 Oasis despite being an inch larger The fabric covers are water resistant, but don’t feel as luxurious as the leather versions - Price The 2017 Amazon Kindle Oasis costs £229.99 (buy here) with 8GB of storage and wifi, £239.99 (buy here) with 32GB and wifi, or £319.99 (buy here) with 32GB and wifi and 3G connectivity. For comparison, the Kindle Voyage costs £170 (buy here) with wifi only, the Paperwhite costs £110 (buy here) with wifi only and adverts, and the standard Kindle costs £60 with ads (buy here). Kobo’s Aura H2O costs £150 (buy here). Verdict The 2017 Amazon Kindle Oasis is the Rolls-Royce of e-readers – a premium device that does little more than the excellent Paperwhite, while costing more than twice the price. But that’s ok. It isn’t the Kindle you should buy, but it’s the one you’ll want to buy. It’s an indulgence. Where last year’s Kindle Oasis was a giant leap forward in e-reader design, the new version is just iterative. The bigger screen makes reading better, but portability slightly worse. The integrated battery makes it a little bit heavier, but less complex. It’s finally water resistant, and an auto-adjusting front light is much appreciated. Audiobook integration through Amazon’s Audible is a great, but expensive alternative way to consume books that may fit better with your commuting patterns – it does mine. The Kindle Oasis provides the best ebook reading experience money can buy. It’s just not a huge upgrade over the excellent model from last year. Pros: long battery life, light, easy to hold, excellent screen, even auto-adjusting frontlight, great page-turn buttons, luxurious feel, faster, Audible integration Cons: expensive, cover not included, no support for third-party audiobooks, no headphones socket Facebook Twitter Pinterest The optional blue fabric Amazon case magnetically attaches to the back and covers the screen.

The compact Soundbox might be your saviour – but it’s pricey if you don’t have Sky Samuel Gibbs Thu 23 Nov 2017 09.55 GMT Last modified on Fri 12 Jan 2018 10.24 GMT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close No more volume jockeying … the Sky Soundbox. Photograph: Sky Sky has partnered with French audio-firm Devialet to create the Soundbox, an all-in-one TV speaker that promises to squeeze full-range, powerful sound into a small box that, in theory, won’t annoy the neighbours. What is it? The Sky Soundbox is essentially a soundbar squeezed into a black speaker box just 37.5cm wide and 21cm deep, which makes it one of the smallest all-in-one speaker systems available. Arguably that is the Soundbox’s biggest strength as it’s barely bigger than the Sky box that it’s designed to be plugged into. It has a total of nine speakers of different sizes and orientations, which work together to produce a wide soundscape, hidden behind the black fabric mesh, and a cut out in the back that hides away two HDMI ports, an optical input and the power socket. At 4Kg the Soundbox is surprisingly heavy, but it has a large rubber foot on the bottom to stop it moving about or shaking your TV cabinet. Setting it up Facebook Twitter Pinterest One HDMI in, one HDMI out and a power plug is all that’s required to hook up the Soundbox to your Sky box and TV, making it a two-minute job. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Hooking up the Soundbox is incredibly easy. Plug one end of the HDMI cable coming out of your Sky box into the speaker. Plug the included HDMI cable into the output of the speaker and into the back of your TV. To route other TV sound through the speaker, just connect an optical cable. Plug in the power and the Sky Q box automatically recognises the speaker, and your TV will probably display a message saying its built-in speakers have been turned off. Using it Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Sky Soundbox comes with a small remote that mimics the look of the Sky Q touch remote. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian There’s a little remote supplied with it, for adjusting volume and changing inputs between HDMI, optical and the Bluetooth connection, which works just like most Bluetooth speakers. If you’ve got a Sky box – and I’m not sure why you would buy the Soundbox if you didn’t – you’ll just use your normal Sky remote to control volume. Hooked up to a Sky Q box you also get what Sky calls “Q Sound”, which basically means audio tuned to the type of content your watching. You can also activate special sound modes, such as vocal enhancer and late night mode, which further modify the audio. Vocal enhancer was genuinely great for boosting the sometimes muddy voices from comedy panel shows, while late night mode is effectively dynamic range compression – making more of the audio all one volume meaning you can better hear the quiet bits and reduce the volume of loud bits at night. As more of us live in ever closer confines with others, late night mode is more useful than you might think. In fact, the Soundbox more or less solved one of the biggest irritations I have with TV audio – incredibly variable volume. While still preserving suspense and range in the audio, the Soundbox removed the need for constant volume jockeying to be able to hear the dialogue but not blow the ears off the neighbours with sounds of gunfire and explosions. What does it sound like? Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Soundbox has a much larger sound stage if you place it in clear air with space either side for the speakers in the ends. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The Soundbox certainly sounds impressive for its size, matching soundbars of a similar price without a sub, and cranking up the volume to levels higher than I would be comfortable sitting in front of. It can’t quite match the bass of a unit with a dedicated sub, however. The virtual surround worked pretty well if the speaker was placed high enough in the room, say on top of the TV cabinet with space either side of it. Placed on the floor sound was much more direct. I wouldn’t quite call it an “immersive 360-degree” experience, but it had a wider soundscape than some much larger soundbars I’ve listened to. Movies and music sounded pretty good with solid separation – at no stage did the action all blend into one. It sounded best with sport, however, bringing a new dimension to football, and where Sky’s Q Sound really seemed to pay off. Observations Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Soundbox is relatively boring to look at, but sort of the point. It’s a small box that gets out the way. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian At 9.5cm tall, the Soundbox might be a little too tall for your TV stand, blocking the bottom of the picture The Soundbox announces source changes and Bluetooth devices connecting and disconnecting, which can be a bit distracting The soundscape is significantly limited if you put it in, rather than on top of a TV cabinet You can’t put anything on top of it and can’t put it on top of a Sky box (according to the manual) It doesn’t support Dolby Atmos, only Dolby Digital Plus Price The Sky Soundbox costs £799 for non-Sky customers, £299 (buy here) for Sky customers and £249 for Sky Q Multiscreen customers. For comparison, the Cambridge Audio TV2 soundbase costs £200 (buy here), the Q Acoustics M3 all-in-one soundbar costs £299 (buy here) and the Sonos Playbase costs £699 (buy here). Verdict The Sky Soundbox is a bit of a unique beast: a compact, all-in-one box that spits out full-range sound marking a significant upgrade to your TV-watching experience. Most competitors are much larger, being either longer soundbars or larger soundbases, and most come with a sub you have to put somewhere. So the Soundbox fills a niche well – for those that want more than tinny TV speakers but that don’t have a lot of room. The oddity is that it is way overpriced at £799 for non-Sky customers, but excellent value priced at £250 for Sky Q Multiroom customers. It’s not perfect, with a few connectivity options and some quirks. But the Soundbox’s simplicity, ability to pretty much eliminate the need for constant volume jockeying and compact size make for a very compelling product, particularly for those trying not to annoy the neighbours. Pros: compact, powerful sound, simple setup, Q Sound modes, good late night mode, no need for a separate sub, Bluetooth Cons: can’t put anything on top of it, needs to be placed in the open, no wifi or multi-room audio, no Dolby Atmos Facebook Twitter Pinterest Buttons on the top turn the Soundbox on or off, switch inputs or control the volume, but most will never need them thanks to the included remote.

Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Amazon’s bigger, 8in HD version of its rock-bottom tablet, the Fire HD 8, has always played second fiddle to the £50 Fire 7, but not any more. Fatter, heavier but cheaper Unlike the new Fire 7 tablet, the 2017 Fire HD 8 is actually thicker and heavier than the previous version, weighing 28g more and being 0.5mm thicker at just under 1cm deep. Side-by-side with 2015’s Fire HD 8 it’s hard to see any difference. The outside is still hardwearing plastic, the sides and corners still rounded, but now it comes in a collection of bright colours. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The back is one solid-feeling piece of textured plastic. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Amazon claims it’s twice as durable as Apple’s iPad mini 4 and it certainly feels like it could take a knock or two without much issue. At 369g, it weighs as much as a large paperback. One of the best bits about the Fire HD 8 is its speakers, which are mounted in the side (or top if held in landscape orientation) and produce fairly good, clear and loud audio, for a tablet. They were pretty good for watching a TV show while cooking, and make using Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa – which is now built into the tablet – much more like the experience you might get from an Echo Dot than the tinny speaker of the Fire 7. The 8in, 720p screen is good but not great. Text is crisper than on the Fire 7, but still not up to the standards you might expect of a modern smartphone or premium tablet. It has good viewing angles, solid colours and is bright enough to be watched indoors, but struggles a bit outdoors. I found reading on it surprisingly good though it’s nowhere near as clear and sharp as an e-reader. The integrated Blue Shade feature helps keep reading at night comfortable by reducing brightness and the amount of blue light emitted by the screen. Specifications Screen: 8in (1280 x 800) LCD (189ppi) Processor: 1.3GHz quad-core RAM: 1.5GB of RAM Storage: 16GB; microSD slot also available Operating system: Fire OS 5 based on Android 5 Lollipop Camera: 2MP rear camera, 0.3MP front-facing camera Connectivity: Wi-Fi n, Bluetooth Dimensions: 214 x 128 x 9.7 mm Weight: 369g A day’s battery Facebook Twitter Pinterest The microSD card slot is in the side of the tablet for if you need more storage than 16 or 32GB. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The new Fire HD 8 has the same 1.3GHz quad-core processor and 1.5GB of RAM as the last one, and performs similarly. It will handle most apps and games perfectly fine, if with slightly longer load times and slower frame rates than you might be used to on a top-end smartphone. It is not what I would call snappy, but the Fire HD 8 scrolled, launched apps and switched between apps without any moments of lag that made me question whether I actually tapped a button or not. With the brightness set at around 70%, the Fire HD 8 easily lasted long enough between charges to view three movies with a bit of light internet use in between and battery to spare. Playing games hurt the battery life a bit more, as did setting the brightness to max, but all in you’ll get around a day’s usage out of the HD 8. Charging it took forever, though, at around six hours, so best done overnight. Fire OS 5.4 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Alexa integration is the highlight of Amazon’s new version of Fire OS. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The Fire HD 8 runs Amazon’s customised version of Android called Fire OS 5.4, the same version as the Fire 7. It looks quite different to the traditional Android experience from Google, lacks Google apps and only has access to the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. Navigating it is easy with clearly marked panes filled with apps, games, books, video, music, magazines, and audio books etc. It makes the best of what is a media consumption device, rather than a working device. There is an email app, Amazon’s Silk browser, contacts, calendar, WPS Office and other bits pre-loaded that do general information management and light office duties should you need them. The Fire HD 8 has Alexa built-in and works pretty well. You have to hold the home button to get it to listen to you, but the speakers are loud and clear enough to hear the answer to your query from across the room. The screen also displays interactive cards such as music controls or more details on a weather forecast while Alexa speaks to you. Observations Facebook Twitter Pinterest The screen is perfectly good enough to watch three berks make a fool of themselves in cars. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The cameras are pretty poor, producing blurry shots with little in the way of detail – only to be used in an emergency There’s a for kids edition of the tablet with a rubber case and no Alexa, but there also kids apps on the default version and fairly good parental controls It requires an Amazon account to use and a Prime account to make the most of it The 16GB of storage is enough for a good handful of TV shows and movies, but the microSD card slot is there if you need more It doesn’t come encrypted out the box, but the option is available Price The 2017 Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet costs £80 for 16GB of storage “with special offers”, which are little adds on the lockscreen for recommended content from Amazon’s store. It costs £10 to remove the adverts. The version with 32GB of storage costs £100 with adverts. Verdict The Amazon Fire HD 8 has always played second fiddle to the cheap-as-chips £50 Fire 7, but this year with the price cut by £10 to just £80 for the starting Fire HD 8, it is actually worth the extra money. You get twice the storage, much longer battery life, a slightly better screen and much better speakers, which make the Fire HD 8 quite a compelling package, if all you want to do is consume media. It’s no iPad, but then it doesn’t try to be. It cuts the right corners to get the job done at a price worth paying. There are some cheaper no-name alternatives, but with the Fire HD 8 you get a brand name, support and experience very difficult to match at £80. If you’re just looking for a cheap tablet to watch a bit of video on, play the odd game and occasionally find the answer to a question, this is the one to buy. Pros: it costs just £80, HD screen, microSD card slot, good battery life, feels durable, good speakers, Alexa Cons: rubbish cameras, very slow charging, chunky, heavy for the size, no USB-C Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Fire HD 8 is a bit big and heavy for prolonged one-handed reading.

And has the utopian 90s net been replaced by digital feudalism, where a few powerful entities wield control over all of us digital serfs? In this series, Jordan Erica Webber looks at internet-enabled dystopia, and how even the technology designed to do good can end up causing harm. To kick off, we explore whether our privacy has been compromised by the tech giants whose business models depend on harvesting and monetising our data. We speak to cyborg rights activist Aral Balkan; the executive director of UK charity Privacy International Gus Hosein; and to Kevin Kelly, founding executive editor of Wired magazine and author of The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future.

Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images At least five buses used to transport Apple employees to the company’s headquarters have had their windows smashed by what is suspected to be pellet guns during the last week. The first window was shattered on the evening of Friday 12 January, as the shuttle bus travelled from the company campus back into San Francisco. Three more were hit on Tuesday morning, followed by another suspected attack on Tuesday evening, according to an email sent to Apple staff and seen by the Guardian. “There is nothing confirmed but it is suspected that a pellet gun might have been used in these incidents,” stated the email to all employees. “Luckily, no one seems to have been injured yet.” Tech's terrible year: how the world turned on Silicon Valley in 2017 Read more California highway patrol public information officer Art Montiel confirmed the incidents. “We received several reports of charter buses being damaged while driving on the I-280, but we’re not sure what caused the damage. We’re not ruling anything out,” he told the Guardian. Montiel said that he could not be sure that the attack was targeted at Apple as the buses are unmarked. “It could be Google, Apple or any other company,” he said. However, the buses of each of the tech firms are a distinct colour: Google’s are white, Apple’s are silver and Facebook’s are blue. Montiel said he had received no reports that other company buses or private vehicles had been targeted. Apple told staff that its commuter buses would be diverted away from the I-280 highway until further notice. Montiel did not believe this strategy would be effective. “If someone was targeting the buses I’m sure they are going to find them anywhere they go. It’s not like they are hidden.” This is not the first time that the corporate buses that ship workers from the city to Silicon Valley have been targeted. In 2013 a window was smashed on a Google bus in Oakland, across the San Francisco Bay. The following year, protesters blocked buses and brandished banners to express their discontent over the privatisation of the Bay Area’s transport system. The buses have become symbols of gentrification and the perception that the tech sector is responsible for pushing up housing prices in the city, making it unaffordable for those without six-figure salaries. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Still, for the past 15 months I have been pushing Facebook to sacrifice near term profits. The reason? I want them to address the harm the platform has caused through addiction and exploitation by bad actors. Government watchdogs barely regulate the technology sector in the United States, so investors like myself have a big role to play. I was once Mark Zuckerberg’s mentor, but I have not been able to speak to him about this. Unfortunately, all the internet platforms are deflecting criticism and leaving their users in peril. Zuckerberg’s announcement on Wednesday that he would be changing the Facebook News Feed to make it promote “meaningful interactions” does little to address the concerns I have with the platform. Facebook overhauls News Feed in favor of 'meaningful social interactions' Read more Thankfully, I am not the only investor demanding Facebook keep users safe. On Monday, two major investors in Apple sent an open letter criticizing the company for not doing enough to protect children from the negative aspects of smartphones and social media. This is a potential game changer. The players are combining two corporate governance strategies in ways that may be harder to resist than traditional strategies. Corporate governance is a murky area. Boards of directors are the first line of corporate governance. They are supposed to act as a check on management, and sometimes they do. More often, boards are handpicked by CEOs and frequently act as a rubber stamp. An example is the Weinstein Companies, where the board turned a blind eye to the alleged sexual misconduct of Harvey Weinstein. In theory, shareholders should have a large voice through their rights to approve the board of directors, the auditors, and changes in corporate policy. One of the two parties to the Apple letter, the California State Teachers Retirement System (Calstrs), is a $222bn pension plan with large stakes in many public companies. xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> The investors who wrote to Apple have an opportunity to change the game Calstrs has historically tried to influence companies through its voting choices. That doesn’t work often, as the vast majority of shareholders support management when they vote. As a result, CEOs and boards have gradually eroded shareholder rights for decades, to the point where technology leaders like Facebook, Google, and Snap are entirely controlled by their founders. The erosion of shareholder rights led to the emergence of a kind of activist investor, which use aggressive public actions to force management to change its behavior. This tactic works often enough that the activist category has grown in recent years. The other party to the Apple letter, Jana Partners, is a very successful activist investor. Jana is a hedge fund, which means they can “go long” on stocks they think will go up and “sell short” stocks they think will go down. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Facebook’s change to its News Feed does little to address the concerns I have with the platform.’ Photograph: Dado Ruvic/Reuters Another constituency with the power to influence corporate governance is customers. In the case of internet platforms, the customers are advertisers. To date, advertisers have stuck with the major internet platforms. Users can have significant influence on internet companies, but only if they stop using the platform. More than 2 billion people worldwide use social media; two-thirds of them use Facebook every day. A scary percentage of smartphone owners exhibit signs of addiction. They can’t quit. The final constituency that matters is employees. In knowledge businesses like Facebook and Google, employees have far more power than they realize. We saw this in the case of Uber, where the board and shareholders ignored alleged malfeasance for many years, and only made changes after a blog post by a former employee, Susan Fowler, about the company’s toxic management culture caused an employee rebellion. So far, the employees of the other platforms have remained loyal to management, despite a tsunami of bad news. Why Facebook's news feed is changing – and how it will affect you Read more The investors who wrote to Apple have an opportunity to change the game. Calstrs represents teachers, so protecting children from internet addiction is a core mission. It has huge voting power and a willingness to use it. Jana has formed a new fund to do social impact investing, bringing the hedge fund model to that world for the first time.

It is not yet known why he wants to buy the site. Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Venture capitalist Peter Thiel has made an offer for Gawker, hoping to overcome legal hurdles and rival bidders for the site whose collapse the billionaire helped precipitate last year, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Gawker’s news site has been inactive for more than a year, after it was shut down following a massive lawsuit against it by wrestling star Hulk Hogan, which Thiel bankrolled. In 2007, Gawker revealed Thiel was gay. Nobody Speak: Trials of the Free Press review – Hulk v Gawker in portrait of wealthy arrogance Read more Gawker is conducting an auction of its remaining assets, including its domain names and nearly 200,000 archived articles. Most of its assets, including its sister pages Deadspin and Jezebel were bought in 2016 for $135m by media company Univision Holdings. Thiel has not said why he wants Gawker, though the potential acquisition would let him take down stories about his personal life that are still on the website, and shut down scope for counter litigation against him. Thiel, an original Facebook investor and a co-founder of PayPal, did not respond to a request for comment. Bankruptcy and legal experts for Gawker have tried to block Thiel’s bid, according to court papers. Thiel funded the lawsuit against Gawker after the site published a sex tape featuring Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea. Hogan won a $140m judgment against the site, and later settled for $31m. Multiple bidders have submitted offers for the site, bankruptcy plan administrator Will Holden said in a phone interview. He will choose a winner as soon as this month, and then request approval for the deal from a US bankruptcy court. If Holden excludes Thiel’s bid, the Silicon Valley titan and cheerleader for Donald Trump could appeal to the judge. The value of Thiel’s bid could not be learned. Gawker is reportedly worth a few million dollars. A group of former Gawker employees this week abandoned their effort to bid, one of the sources said, having failed to raise their goal of $500,000.

Photograph: Winni Wintermeyer for the Guardian Google is facing renewed controversy over its alleged intolerance toward conservatives at the company, after a class action lawsuit filed by former engineer James Damore disclosed almost 100 pages of screen shots of internal communications in which employees discuss sensitive political issues. 'I see things differently': James Damore on his autism and the Google memo Read more The evidence appended to the lawsuit, which was filed on Monday, includes a message from Rachel Whetstone, who worked as a senior Google executive after a career in the UK Conservative party, bemoaning “prejudiced and antagonistic” political discourse at the company. Damore, who was fired in 2017 after writing a controversial memo about gender and technology, alleges in the lawsuit that white, male conservative employees at Google are “ostracized, belittled, and punished”. The lawsuit claims that numerous Google managers maintained “blacklists” of conservative employees with whom they refused to work; that Google has a list of conservatives who are banned from visiting the campus; and that Google’s firings of Damore and the other named plaintiff, David Gudeman, were discriminatory. “We look forward to defending against Mr Damore’s lawsuit in court,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. The company’s workforce, like much of the rest of the tech industry, is overwhelmingly white, Asian, and male. In 2017, the US Department of Labor accused Google of “extreme pay discrimination” against women, and a group of women have filed a class-action lawsuit against the company alleging systemic wage discrimination. But the Damore lawsuit purports to expose a cultural bias toward promoting diversity and “social justice” that, the suit claims, has created a “protected, distorted bubble of groupthink”. Efforts to increase the representation of women and underrepresented racial minorities, which companies like Google have undertaken in response to external criticism, are cast in the suit as illegal discrimination against the majority. Screenshots of internal communications reveal numerous employees appearing to support the idea of being intolerant toward certain points of view, such as one post arguing that Google should respond to Damore’s memo by “disciplining or terminating those who have expressed support”. In another post, a manager stated his intention to “silence” certain “violently offensive” perspectives, writing: “There are certain ‘alternative views, including different political views’ which I do not want people to feel safe to share here … You can believe that women or minorities are unqualified all you like … but if you say it out loud, then you deserve what’s coming to you”. Internal posts discussing the debate around diversity at Google, such as a meme of a penguin with the text “If you want to increase diversity at Google fire all the bigoted white men”, are filed as an appendix to the lawsuit under the heading “Anti-Caucasian postings”. One manager is quoted as posting: “I keep a written blacklist of people whom I will never allow on or near my team, based on how they view and treat their coworkers. That blacklist got a little longer today.” Another screenshot reveals a manager proposing the creation of a list of “people who make diversity difficult”, and weighing the possibility that individuals could have “something resembling a trial” before being included. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The lawsuit claims that numerous Google managers maintained ‘blacklists’ of conservative employees. Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters In the 2014 email from Whetstone, who served as senior vice-president of communications and public policy at Google for several years before departing for Uber, she wrote: “It seems like we believe in free expression except when people disagree with the majority view … I have lost count of the times at Google, for example, people tell me privately that they cannot admit their voting choice if they are Republican because they fear how other Googlers react.” The complaint argues that Google’s tolerance for “alternative lifestyles” – the company has internal mailing lists for people interested in “furries, polygamy, transgenderism, and plurality” – does not extend to conservatism. One employee who emailed a list seeking parenting advice related to imparting a child with “traditional gender roles and patriarchy from a very young age” was allegedly chastised by human resources. The suit also alleges that Google maintains a “secret” blacklist of conservative authors who are banned from being on campus. Curtis Yarvin, a “neoreactionary” who blogs under the name Mencius Moldbug, was allegedly removed from the campus by security after being invited to lunch. The plaintiffs subsequently learned, it is claimed in the suit, that Alex Jones, the InfoWars conspiracy theorist, and Theodore Beale, an “alt-right” blogger known as VoxDay, were also banned from the campus. Google faces new discrimination charge: paying female teachers less than men Read more The suit will likely reignite the culture wars that have swirled around the tech industry since the election of Donald Trump. Many liberals within the tech industry have pressured their employers to take a stand against Trump policies, such as the Muslim travel ban, and companies have struggled to decide the extent to which they will allow the resurgent movement of white nationalists to use their platforms to organize. Damore’s firing in August last year was heavily covered by the rightwing media, which portrayed the saga as evidence of Silicon Valley’s liberal bias, and the engineer was transformed into a political martyr by prominent members of the “alt-right”. In making its case against Google, the suit reveals some of the internal backlash Damore received after his memo went viral, including a mass email in which a Google director called the memo “repulsive and intellectually dishonest” and an email to Damore from a fellow engineer stating: “I will keep hounding you until one of us is fired.” Gudeman, the second named plaintiff, was fired following a post-election controversy in another online forum at Google. A Google employee posted that he was concerned for his safety under a Trump administration because he had already been “targeted by the FBI (including at work) for being a Muslim”. According to the suit, Gudeman responded skeptically to the comment, raising questions about the FBI’s motives for investigating the employee, and was reported to HR.

Photograph: Jam City/Warner Bros Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, a mobile game for iOS and Android from developer Jam City, will be released this spring. It will be the first Harry Potter video game since 2012’s Wonderbook: Book of Spells, for Sony’s PlayStation 3. It will also be the first game released under Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment’s new Portkey Games label, which the company set up last year. Announced via JK Rowling’s Pottermore site in November, Portkey Games will “work with talented creators to build games that focus on player-generated stories, which will live alongside the magical universe created by JK Rowling”. The game casts players as Hogwarts students, during the time between Harry’s birth and his admission to the wizarding school. Players can “create a personalised student avatar, attend classes, learn magical skills, form friendships or rivalries with other students, and make pivotal decisions that will influence their character’s story arc as they traverse their years at Hogwarts and grow as a witch or wizard”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A teaser trailer for Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery. It will face competition from Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, another mobile game from Pokémon Go developer Niantic, also scheduled for release this year through Portkey Games. Like Pokémon Go, Wizards Unite will use augmented reality technology to superimpose the Harry Potter universe onto the real world, placing magical artefacts and creatures around players’ neighbourhoods.

Photograph: PR French video game studio Quantic Dream has been accused of propagating a toxic working environment, according to reports in three French news publications. Quantic Dream is one of France’s best-known and most successful development studios. Its mature-themed cinematic games, including psychological horror title Heavy Rain and supernatural adventure Beyond: Two Souls, have sold in their millions. But stories published by Le Monde, investigative site Mediapart and gaming site Canard PC allege that the company’s success hides a “a toxic corporate culture” where inappropriate language and behaviour is routine and employees face overwhelming workloads. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Quantic Dream’s David Cage. Photograph: Stephane Grangier/Corbis via Getty Images Studio heads David Cage and Guillaume de Fondaumière are both accused of turning a blind eye to the unhealthy working culture and of behaving inappropriately themselves. Both have denied all of the allegations. The allegations came to light last spring when members of staff, including the head of the IT department, filed a complaint against the studio regarding Photoshopped images of employees. These images, said to have been created by an unnamed member of staff and distributed around the office since 2013, are alleged to have included racist, sexist and homophobic elements. Some 600 Photoshopped images are said to have been circulated, depicting employees of the 180-strong studio in Nazi uniforms, swimming costumes and sexualised nurse outfits. Cage and De Fondaumière claimed they were unaware that some of the images were offensive, and told Mediapart that the images had been removed from the company servers as soon as the complaint was received. Quantic Dream’s Guillaume de Fondaumière. Photograph: Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images for DIFF However, the IT head has since brought a wrongful dismissal complaint against the company through a Paris labour tribunal and, according to Mediapart, elements of the company’s working practices came to light during the hearing. Le Monde and Mediapart spoke to 15 current and former members of staff who claimed that the Photoshopped images were emblematic of a troubling company culture. Among the accusations – made by the 15 current and former staff members and reported in Le Monde – are that Cage made jokes with racist and homophobic undertones. Cage told Le Monde that these accusations were “ridiculous, absurd and grotesque”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest One of Quantic Dream’s best-selling games, Heavy Rain “You want to talk about homophobia?” he said. “We work with Ellen Page, who fights for LGBT rights. You want to talk about racism? We work with Jesse Williams, who fights for civil rights in the United States. Judge my work.” Elsewhere, De Fondaumière is accused by former female employees of acting inappropriately at office functions – greeting people using lips to cheek rather than the more formal (and more usual in a professional environment) cheek to cheek manner of kissing. De Fondaumière labelled the accusations “absolutely false”. The Le Monde and Mediapart reports also detail complaints about long working hours, with unnamed staff complaining of routinely working 60-hour weeks, plus regular weekend hours. French employment law dictates that a working week is 35 hours and that the working day may not exceed 10 hours. De Fondaumière denied staff were forced to work long hours, and said that they were paid overtime if they did. Quantic Dream faced controversy in October when a trailer for its forthcoming title Detroit: Become Human was widely criticised for a scene depicting domestic violence. Some felt the sequence, in which an android attempts to protect a child from an abusive father, trivialised the issue. According to the Le Monde report, staff members warned Cage that the scene would cause upset and could be interpreted as misogynistic – but their advice went unheeded. Cage called this, “a lie, pure and simple”. Following the publication of the reports, Quantic Dream released a statement via Twitter: “Articles published today level various allegations against Quantic Dream, its management and employees. We categorically deny all of these allegations [...] Inappropriate conduct or practices have no place at Quantic Dream. We have taken and always will take such grievances very seriously.

The game was shown alongside a number of other new versions of older games for Switch, including cult hit The World Ends With You, Super Nintendo classic Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze and Hyrule Warriors. Dark Souls, an intricate and arcane work of dark fantasy, pits players against a world of demonic creatures, is widely regarded as one of the best video games of all time. First released in late 2011, it took an influential approach to video game storytelling, letting its community of players piece together its backstory over the course of several years from well-hidden and often ambiguous hints hidden within the game world. Players could also appear in each others’ games to either help or hinder each others’ progress, maintaining a community of dedicated players that is still active seven years later. Its publisher Bandai Namco estimates that it and its two sequels have sold more then 9 million copies. The remastered version will be released on 25 May with “improved framerate and resolution”, according to Nintendo. It will also be available on the Playstation 4, Xbox One, and PC. From Software has also revealed a Dark Souls Trilogy box-set, set to be released on PlayStation 4 in May. The set features Dark Souls and its two sequels as well as a collection of soundtrack CDs. Nintendo recently claimed that the Switch was the fastest-selling games console in US history, having sold 4.8 million units in the 10 months since its launch last March. Playable both at home and away thanks to a pair of detachable controllers, the console has also proved popular in Japan and Europe, selling a combined worldwide total of 10 million.

Photograph: Epic Games The first real-world effects of processor vulnerabilities Meltdown and Spectre are beginning to show, due to fixes for the two megabugs which have the side-effect of slowing down cloud services worldwide. Online video game Fortnite is one of the worst hit, with the game’s creators attributing login issues and service instability to a 30 percentage point spike in processor use that occurred when the company installed the patches. Q&A What are Meltdown and Spectre? Show Hide Meltdown and Spectre are the names of two serious security flaws that have been found within computer processors. They could allow hackers to steal sensitive data without users knowing, one of them – Meltdown – affecting chips made as far back as 1995. Meltdown is a security flaw that could allow hackers to bypass the hardware barrier between applications run by users and the computer’s core memory, which is normally highly protected. Spectre is slightly different. It potentially allows hackers to trick otherwise error-free applications into giving up secret information. Practically every computing device affected by Spectre, including laptops, desktops, tablets, smartphones and even cloud computing systems. A few lower power devices, such as certain Internet of Things gadgets, are unaffected. Read a full explainer on Spectre and Meltdown processor security flaws Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. “All of our cloud services are affected by updates required to mitigate the Meltdown vulnerability,” said a spokesperson for Fortnite’s publisher, Epic Games. “We heavily rely on cloud services to run our back-end and we may experience further service issues due to ongoing updates. We are working with our cloud service providers to prevent further issues and will do everything we can to mitigate and resolve any issues that arise as quickly as possible.” Users of AWS, Amazon’s cloud services division, have seen similar spikes in CPU usage following the patches. One developer reported processor utilisation tripling, while a number of others took to support forums to complain of degraded performance and forced reboots immediately after the system maintenance. Individual users may also see slowdowns following the installation of the fixes, but only if they carry out particular types of intensive use: casual users and hardcore gamers are unlikely to see any reduction in efficiency locally, since they don’t perform the sorts of actions which the patches impact. Security experts are warning users to apply the software patches regardless of whether or not they expect to suffer from system slowdown, since the downsides of running a vulnerable computer are much worse than simple sluggishness. Spectre and Meltdown expose users with affected processors – which comprise a substantial proportion of those on the market – to data theft through attacks as simple as malicious advertisements.

1707\Technology\SEATTLE — Amazon said on Thursday that it had whittled the list of possible homes for its second headquarters to 20, including centers of technology like Boston and some surprise locations like Columbus, Ohio. The full list of finalists leans toward locations in the Midwest and South and on the East Coast, and away from the tech-saturated hubs of the West Coast. It includes: Atlanta Austin, Tex. Boston Chicago Columbus, Ohio Dallas Denver Indianapolis Los Angeles Miami Montgomery County, Md. Nashville Newark New York Northern Virginia Philadelphia Pittsburgh Raleigh, N.C. Toronto Washington, D.C. Many of the finalists, including Dallas, Denver, Raleigh and Washington, were considered shoo-ins from the moment Amazon announced the search, largely because of the attributes that the company said it was seeking for its second home. Those criteria included a metropolitan area with a population of greater than one million and the ability to attract and keep strong technical talent. More unexpected was Amazon’s selection of locations not typically thought of as tech centers, such as Columbus, Indianapolis, Miami and Nashville. Los Angeles was the sole city from the West Coast to make the cut. Just as surprising was Amazon’s rejection of applications from Detroit, Phoenix and San Diego. Although it received bids from regions in Mexico, Amazon narrowed its finalists to just American locations and one city in Canada, Toronto. Terry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia, celebrated the acceptance of his state’s bid in a message on Twitter. “Let’s close the deal and bring it home!” he wrote. The company, based in Seattle, selected the finalists out of a pile of more than 238 applications submitted by local officials in Mexico, Canada and the United States — all of them eager to attract the 50,000 high-paying jobs the company says it could bring. When the unusual public contest was announced in September, it set off a public charm offensive by the applicants, with many local officials trying to entice Amazon with tax breaks and other benefits. The process will now shift into a new phase, with Amazon representatives communicating more directly with finalist cities as they prepare to select a winner later this year, and perhaps with cities being even more outspoken about why they should be chosen. “Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough — all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity,” said Holly Sullivan, Amazon’s head of economic development. “Through this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation.” Amazon provided little detail about how it picked the finalists for its second headquarters, which it is calling HQ2, other than to say it based it choices on the criteria it laid out for the search earlier. According to people briefed on the process who would speak only anonymously because the deliberations were private, the process was conducted by a team of about a dozen people within Amazon, including economists, human resources managers and executives who oversee real estate. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive who was the mastermind behind turning the search into a public process and coined the term “HQ2,” was also involved, the people said. Amazon said in September that it needed a second headquarters because it would soon outgrow its hometown, Seattle. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, founded the company there in 1994, and it has since transformed Seattle, employing more than 40,000 in the city. That expansion has also contributed to the city’s soaring cost of living and traffic woes. To lure applicants, Amazon showered local politicians with statistics about the impact the company has had on the Seattle economy and some of the immediate economic benefits for its new home, including plans to spend $5 billion for construction of its second headquarters. It asked candidates to include in their bids a variety of detailed information about the area, including potential building sites, crime and traffic stats and nearby recreational opportunities. And it asked cities and states to describe the tax incentives available to offset Amazon’s costs for building and operating its second headquarters. The response prompted a wave of publicity stunts by cities that surprised even Amazon. A business group in Tucson trucked a giant cactus to Amazon in Seattle, and the mayor of Washington buttered up Amazon in a promotional video in which she called it the “most interesting company in the world.” An economic development group in Calgary, Alberta, took out an advertisement in The Seattle Times in which it offered to fight a bear for Amazon and spray-painted Seattle sidewalks with a humorous promise to change the city’s name to Calmazon or Amagary. There were also more serious offers, including a commitment of up to $7 billion in tax incentives by New Jersey to bring Amazon to Newark. Officials in Chicago offered Amazon tax credits that would allow it to keep about $1.32 billion in income taxes that employees would ordinarily pay to the state, according to a report by The Chicago Reader. The process has also attracted critics. Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit organization that serves as an advocate for local businesses, said that local politicians were enhancing Amazon’s image just as the company’s market power was under growing scrutiny from groups like her own. “As these cities woo and grovel, they are basically communicating this idea that we should want Amazon to be bigger and more powerful in our economy,” Ms. Mitchell said. In an interview before Amazon announced its list of finalists, Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, said Amazon, long criticized in Seattle for its role in a booming economy that has displaced lower-income residents and minorities, had an opportunity to make a statement by selecting a less fortunate city for its new headquarters. “There’s an opportunity to turn the page here and create a new narrative for the company,” he said.\-0.2315605729818344,-0.2905057966709137,-1.587396264076233,0.4328405261039734,0.20264077186584473,-1.0750179290771484,1.3906655311584473,0.393079549074173,-1.6015266180038452,-0.6107944846153259,-0.8723702430725098,-0.023228177800774574,-1.7406216859817505,1.1272263526916504,-1.0040051937103271,0.437005877494812,0.5853984355926514,0.13935250043869019,0.20217646658420563,-1.4550937414169312,0.5152712464332581,-0.4635171890258789,-0.036130886524915695,-1.1794525384902954,0.8672353625297546,-0.1388261914253235,1.3784880638122559,0.822684109210968,9.722033864818513E-4,0.3469630777835846,-0.13808271288871765,0.7685684561729431,-0.3778150975704193,-1.1263507604599,0.2625926733016968,0.7556272149085999,0.3846840262413025,-0.2925320267677307,0.929226815700531,-0.14268758893013,-0.839900016784668,0.3130667209625244,0.7063871026039124,0.19721220433712006,-1.1711276769638062,-0.9307592511177063,1.4274581670761108,0.6863154172897339,-1.360608696937561,-0.6543251872062683,0.3734515607357025,-0.2930043339729309,-0.5555079579353333,-0.21742130815982819,0.6178452968597412,-0.8798092603683472,0.4468206465244293,-0.3284790813922882,-1.9529317617416382,0.36739882826805115,0.4334818720817566,-1.9196312427520752,0.09934118390083313,0.5950667858123779,-0.5172026753425598,-0.31502512097358704,0.9651612639427185,1.5385504961013794,-1.422929048538208,-0.745667040348053,1.4873911142349243,-0.5550981163978577,0.025971300899982452,0.5517767667770386,-0.19121050834655762,0.11199426651000977,0.28322580456733704,-0.2245529592037201,-1.5704021453857422,-1.1647460460662842,0.5248759388923645,-1.0616271495819092,-1.6429566144943237,1.7008090019226074,0.4938472509384155,-0.7585380673408508,-0.1986801028251648,0.4845052659511566,0.23916910588741302,0.2969483435153961,-0.45869991183280945,2.047346353530884,-1.7003090381622314,0.022501220926642418,0.7786427140235901,-6.282607209868729E-4,-0.25115203857421875,-0.39300233125686646,-0.46019503474235535,0.33970507979393005\NYTIMES\Amazon Chooses 20 Finalists for Second Headquarters\2018-01-18 16:29:06.0\
1708\Technology\SAN FRANCISCO — Apple, which had long deferred paying taxes on its foreign earnings and had become synonymous with hoarding money overseas, unveiled plans on Wednesday that would bring back the vast majority of the $252 billion in cash that it held abroad and said it would make a sizable investment in the United States. With the moves, Apple took advantage of the new tax code that President Trump signed into law last month. A provision allows for a one-time repatriation of corporate cash held abroad at a lower tax rate than what would have been paid under the previous tax plan. Apple, which has 94 percent of its total cash of $269 billion outside the United States, said it would make a one-time tax payment of $38 billion on the repatriated cash. For years, Apple had said it would not bring its foreign earnings back to the United States until the corporate tax code changed, because such a move would be too costly. Now Apple’s bet to hold back on paying such taxes is reaping rewards under the Trump administration. In return, Mr. Trump and other Republicans can point to Apple as having come around because of their legislative action. The $38 billion tax payment from the Silicon Valley giant is set to be among the biggest payouts from the tax bill, and Apple said it would put some of the money it brought back toward 20,000 new jobs, a new domestic campus and other spending. “I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday. “Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS.” Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said in a statement, “We have a deep sense of responsibility to give back to our country and the people who help make our success possible.” Apple estimated that its direct impact on the American economy would total more than $350 billion over the next five years, but how much that goes beyond what the company would have spent anyway is unclear. Apple’s current pace of spending in the United States is $55 billion for 2018, so it was already on track to spend $275 billion over the next five years. After the $38 billion tax payment is subtracted, that leaves its new investment at roughly $37 billion over the next five years. A. M. Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said Apple had consistently spent tens of billions of dollars on areas like staffing and capital expenditures in recent years. Bringing back the overseas cash, he said, does little to aid its expansion. But it makes the company appear to answer Mr. Trump’s call for more jobs to be created in the United States. “This is Apple putting its best foot forward consistent with objectives of the administration,” Mr. Sacconaghi said. Apple is one of several multinational giants that have kept a total of roughly $3 trillion in global profits off their domestic books to sidestep the previous 35 percent federal corporate tax rate. Under the new tax law, companies that make a one-time repatriation of cash will be taxed at a rate of 15.5 percent on cash holdings and 8 percent on nonliquid assets. That is lower than the new 21 percent corporate rate. And under the new tax code, Apple would also have been taxed whether it brought the money back or not. By shifting the money under the new terms, Apple has saved $43 billion in taxes, more than any other American company, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research group in Washington. Other tech giants are set to follow suit in the coming months. Companies like Microsoft, Alphabet and Cisco also shifted their profits into offshore shell companies, avoiding billions of dollars in taxes, and are now in a better position to bring the money back. Although Republican supporters of the tax law argued that the influx of international profits would create jobs and increase wages, many economists disagreed that a one-time repatriation would have any substantial impact on real investment. Apple’s announcement, couched as a major investment in the United States instead of a massive financial windfall, followed years of criticism that the company did not do enough for the American economy because it makes most of its products in China and parked its profits abroad. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Apple was a frequent target of Mr. Trump, who pledged that as president he would force the company to start making iPhones and Macs in the United States. While that hasn’t happened and is unlikely to, Apple has since gone on a charm offensive to demonstrate its value to the American economy. The company has highlighted the number of jobs created by the so-called app economy, an ecosystem of software and services that run on the iPhone and other Apple products. Last year, Apple also said it was creating a $1 billion fund to invest in advanced manufacturing in the United States. On Wednesday, Apple said it was increasing the size of that fund to $5 billion and noted that it was already backing projects from manufacturers in Kentucky and Texas. Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., also took a page out of Amazon’s public relations strategy on Wednesday by saying it will open a new domestic campus in a location where it currently has no operations. Amazon garnered good will throughout the country last year when it announced plans to open a second corporate headquarters outside its home base of Seattle. Apple currently has about 84,000 employees in the United States, so 20,000 new jobs would be a 24 percent increase. The company added that it would invest more than $30 billion in capital expenditures, or spending on parts and the equipment required to produce them, over the next five years in the United States. For a comparison, Apple spent $14.9 billion in capital expenditures in the last fiscal year, though it did not specify how much it spends in the United States alone. For Apple, repatriating the cash creates opportunities that could include acquisitions and higher dividends for shareholders. The company had previously chosen to borrow money to fund its stock buybacks and dividends, instead of bringing its cash back from abroad. Over the last five years, Apple has returned $233 billion in cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Paying $38 billion in taxes now is unlikely to strain Apple’s checkbook because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings. “From a financial statement perspective, it’s going to be a nonevent,” said J. Richard Harvey, a Villanova University law professor and former Internal Revenue Service official. Other companies are not as prepared, he said, and would likely have to take a significant loss should they make a one-time cash repatriation. Apple employees will see benefits as well. Mr. Cook said in an email to staff on Wednesday that Apple was increasing investment in its employees by rewarding them with bonuses of $2,500 in restricted stock units, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plans were not public. Apple joins other companies, such as AT&T, that have issued employee bonuses since the tax law was signed.\-1.4000946283340454,0.8664476871490479,-0.18522265553474426,-0.7212062478065491,1.3482229709625244,-0.5167791843414307,0.18578578531742096,0.5059834718704224,-1.7737393379211426,1.2483144998550415,-0.4936372935771942,-0.7056373357772827,-0.6053694486618042,0.09596283733844757,-0.17573297023773193,0.2229679375886917,0.32569679617881775,-0.10696662217378616,0.40503475069999695,0.3247750401496887,0.6788520812988281,-0.6157050132751465,0.658638596534729,-0.1780203878879547,-0.7737458348274231,-0.20506533980369568,-0.619624137878418,0.2933572828769684,-0.15726979076862335,0.15206606686115265,-0.4519155025482178,1.1586707830429077,0.6732551455497742,-0.9276587963104248,-0.44133463501930237,-0.378452867269516,-0.3442433178424835,-1.1574187278747559,0.29177001118659973,0.9064394235610962,-0.8413447141647339,0.46954336762428284,-0.3480161130428314,-0.8798626661300659,-0.28115683794021606,-0.44271019101142883,0.9260799884796143,-0.3164781332015991,0.4221861660480499,1.3144069910049438,0.19588150084018707,-0.37195584177970886,-0.6203538775444031,-0.2454928755760193,0.5246594548225403,1.0017681121826172,0.18068112432956696,1.3388843536376953,-1.235474705696106,-0.8895755410194397,-1.068450927734375,-0.49442023038864136,0.395873099565506,0.9579707980155945,-3.191816806793213,1.1350586414337158,-0.623103678226471,1.7560876607894897,-1.496143102645874,0.7502939105033875,0.4717252254486084,-0.8570274114608765,0.886776864528656,-1.0923969745635986,-0.487240195274353,1.0747922658920288,-0.26152992248535156,0.9722861051559448,-0.10961601138114929,-1.6971355676651,0.1639077514410019,-1.3169139623641968,-0.6855026483535767,1.0298317670822144,0.11879882216453552,-0.21116125583648682,0.02886512130498886,0.7550118565559387,0.9833797812461853,-0.0741046592593193,1.0454907417297363,1.1167200803756714,-0.6563456654548645,0.7178045511245728,0.39076879620552063,-2.135601043701172,0.9709398746490479,0.06304161995649338,-2.1026854515075684,-0.48736733198165894\NYTIMES\Apple, Capitalizing on New Tax Law, Plans to Bring Billions in Cash Back to U.S.\2018-01-18 02:56:36.0\
1709\Technology\It’s not Apple’s fault that you feel enslaved by your phone. But the company that gave the world the modern smartphone has a perfect opportunity this year to create a brave and groundbreaking new take on that device: a phone that encourages you to use it more thoughtfully, more deliberately — and a lot less. Tech “addiction” is a topic of rising national concern. I put the A-word in quotes because the precise pull that our phones exert over us isn’t the same as that of drugs or alcohol. The issue isn’t really new, either; researchers who study how we use digital technology have for years been warning of its potential negative effects on our cognition, psyche and well-being. What is new is who has joined the ranks of the worried. Recently, a parade of tech luminaries, including several former Facebook employees, have argued that we’re no match for the sophisticated machinery of engagement and persuasion being built into smartphone apps. Their fears are manifold: They’re worried about distraction, productivity, how social networks alter our emotional lives and relationships, and what they’re doing to children. It’s hard to know what to make of these confessions of regret. Come on, guys — you gave us these wondrous machines, you made billions of dollars from their ubiquity, and now you tell us they’re bad? Also, what do we do about it? Like air pollution or intrusive online advertising, tech addiction is a collective-action problem caused by misaligned incentives. Companies that make money from your attention — that is, ad-supported apps like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube — now employ armies of people who work with supercomputers to hook you ever more deeply into their services. Sure, we should call on them to act more ethically — and Facebook, for its part, has said it’s willing to lose money to improve its users’ well-being — but I’m skeptical they’ll be able to suppress their economic interests. Government regulation and more restraint from users might also help, but the former is unlikely and the latter is insufficient. So who’s left? The same company that always seems to turn up when it’s time to cross into a new era of technology: Apple. I got to thinking about Apple’s responsibility last week when two large investors wrote an open letter asking the company to do more about its products’ effects on children. I was initially inclined to dismiss the letter as a publicity stunt; if you’re worried about children and tech, why not go after Facebook? But when I called several experts, I found they agreed with the investors. Sure, they said, Apple isn’t responsible for the excesses of the digital ad business, but it does have a moral responsibility to — and a business interest in — the well-being of its customers. And there’s another, more important reason for Apple to take on tech addiction: because it would probably do an elegant job of addressing the problem. “I do think this is their time to step up,” said Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google who now runs Time Well Spent, an organization working to improve technology’s impact on society. “In fact,” Mr. Harris added, “they may be our only hope.” For one thing, Apple’s business model does not depend on tech addiction. The company makes most of its money by selling premium devices at high profit margins. Yes, it needs to make sure you find your phone useful enough to buy the next one, but after you purchase your phone and sign up for some of its premium services, Apple doesn’t really need you to overdo it. Indeed, because it can’t make infinite battery life, Apple would probably be O.K. if you cooled it with your phone a little. Yet even though Apple is not part of the ad business, it exerts lots of control over it. Every tech company needs a presence on the iPhone or iPad; this means that Apple can set the rules for everyone. With a single update to its operating system and its app store, Apple could curb some of the worst excesses in how apps monitor and notify you to keep you hooked (as it has done, for instance, by allowing ad blockers in its mobile devices). And because other smartphone makers tend to copy Apple’s best inventions, whatever it did to curb our dependence on our phones would be widely emulated. Mr. Harris suggested several ideas for Apple to make a less-addictive smartphone. For starters, Apple could give people a lot more feedback about how they’re using their devices. Imagine if, once a week, your phone gave you a report on how you spent your time, similar to how your activity tracker tells you how sedentary you were last week. It could also needle you: “Farhad, you spent half your week scrolling through Twitter. Do you really feel proud of that?” It could offer to help: “If I notice you spending too much time on Snapchat next week, would you like me to remind you?” Another idea is to let you impose more fine-grained controls over notifications. Today, when you let an app send you mobile alerts, it’s usually an all-or-nothing proposition — you say yes to letting it buzz you, and suddenly it’s buzzing you all the time. Mr. Harris suggested that Apple could require apps to assign a kind of priority level to their notifications. “Let’s say you had three notification levels — heavy users, regular users and lite, or Zen,” Mr. Harris said. Apple could set rules for what kind of notifications were allowed in each bucket — for instance, the medium bucket might allow notifications generated by other people (like a direct message in Instagram) but not those from the app itself (Instagram just sending you an alert to remind you that your high school friend’s mom’s brother posted a new picture recently). “And then Apple could say, by default, everyone is in the middle level — and instantly it could save a ton of users a ton of energy in dealing with this,” Mr. Harris said. There’s a danger that some of these anti-addiction efforts could get too intrusive. But that’s also why Apple would shine here; building a less-addictive phone is chiefly a problem of interface design, which is basically Apple’s entire corporate raison d’être. Another thing that Apple is good at is marketing, and I suspect it could make a lot of gauzy ads showing people getting more out of iPhones and iPads by unplugging from them for a little while. Note that it already sells a device, the Apple Watch, whose marketing extols the magic of leaving your phone behind. Done right, a full-fledged campaign pushing the benefits of a more deliberative approach to tech wouldn’t come off as self-interest, but in keeping with Apple’s best vision of itself — as a company that looks out for the interests of humanity in an otherwise cold and sometimes inhumane industry. “How we live with technology is the cultural issue of the next half-century,” said James Steyer, the founder and chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group that studies how children are affected by media. He suggested that the feeling was ripe for Apple to tap into. “It’s something that everyone cares about — whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative, whether you live in San Francisco or Biloxi, Miss., you know that you and your kids are part of the arms race for attention,” he said. Apple released a statement last week saying it cared deeply “about how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them,” adding that it had a few features on addiction in the works. Apple hardly ever talks about future products, so it declined to elaborate on any of its ideas when I called. Let’s hope it’s working on something grand.\1.4723905324935913,-0.8673014640808105,0.8270891308784485,0.6026964783668518,-0.1388242095708847,0.07130693644285202,1.0302107334136963,-1.394068956375122,-0.5302106738090515,-1.014208197593689,0.7129470109939575,0.4679167866706848,-0.6564480662345886,0.11708784848451614,-0.5068480968475342,-0.17854838073253632,-0.872147262096405,1.3599393367767334,0.11813563108444214,-0.3263638913631439,0.16390448808670044,-1.566949725151062,1.2010133266448975,-1.5457580089569092,0.1270042359828949,1.4595692157745361,0.8627989292144775,-0.13294555246829987,-0.26603588461875916,-0.4543992877006531,-1.1244663000106812,2.9212687015533447,1.1082395315170288,-0.499600887298584,0.5200669169425964,-0.9988400936126709,-0.353972464799881,-0.07861435413360596,0.1979709416627884,-0.7762770056724548,-0.6054655909538269,-0.9979954957962036,1.9165184497833252,-0.4203943908214569,-1.4202970266342163,-1.5381993055343628,0.40572452545166016,-0.34386932849884033,-0.15708035230636597,0.34612736105918884,1.6490567922592163,-0.6358606219291687,-1.256527304649353,0.3581690192222595,0.5071749091148376,0.02590862102806568,1.8245587348937988,0.5768218636512756,-0.3467167317867279,1.0479114055633545,-1.6151413917541504,-0.38251978158950806,-0.4651724696159363,-0.890299916267395,-0.027548735961318016,0.3990786373615265,1.0797266960144043,1.0362355709075928,-2.290900707244873,0.23960965871810913,1.2267789840698242,-0.6990631222724915,-1.2061628103256226,0.5881687998771667,0.018850350752472878,0.3204522728919983,-2.15560245513916,-0.08438557386398315,-1.4030026197433472,-1.46454918384552,-0.39132994413375854,-0.2524043619632721,-1.121533751487732,1.4305912256240845,0.6615685224533081,0.962096631526947,-1.0704401731491089,0.1529703438282013,0.15492774546146393,-1.1442285776138306,-1.2066991329193115,-0.37337425351142883,-0.7559172511100769,1.0926629304885864,0.1354255974292755,0.43054938316345215,0.06917253881692886,-0.5833671689033508,-2.8187239170074463,1.5990219116210938\NYTIMES\State of the Art: It’s Time for Apple to Build a Less Addictive iPhone\2018-01-17 11:00:23.0\
1710\Technology\For five and a half years, nearly the entire tenure of its chief executive, Virginia M. Rometty, IBM has reported a steady erosion of revenue. Selling off its chip manufacturing and smaller data-center computer businesses contributed to the decline. So, too, did the fact that new businesses like cloud computing, data analytics and artificial intelligence had not yet grown big enough to make up for the downturn in IBM’s traditional hardware and software products. But IBM’s half-decade losing streak will most likely end on Thursday, analysts predict, when the company reports its quarterly performance. The crossover to growth would be a long-awaited bright spot for Ms. Rometty and IBM, a challenged giant that has been overshadowed in recent years by the younger technology giants on the West Coast. Even if IBM delivers a revenue gain, however, the bigger question facing the company remains: Has Ms. Rometty turned it around? Skeptics abound. IBM is expected to have gotten an extra lift in the most recent quarter from currency gains and strong sales of a new line of mainframe computers. Without that help, the company’s revenue would decline by 2 percent or so, according to an estimate from A. M. Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein. “Is a turnaround afoot? I don’t see it yet,” Mr. Sacconaghi said. There is no doubt, though, that there are signs of progress at IBM, which would not comment on its financial picture before the release of the earning report. So much attention is focused on the company’s top line because revenue is the broadest measure of the headway IBM is making in a difficult transformation toward cloud computing, data handling and A.I. offerings for corporate customers. The new businesses — “strategic imperatives,” IBM calls them — now account for 45 percent of the company’s revenue. And though it still has a ways to go, IBM has steadily built up those operations — and gained converts. The number of software developers using its cloud technology has doubled in the last year, IBM says, though it would not provide numbers. On Wednesday, Barclays upgraded IBM’s stock to a buy and noted its long-term opportunity in the cloud market. IBM’s stock price, a notable laggard as markets have surged in recent years, has climbed nearly 10 percent so far this year. IBM was slow to recognize the significance of cloud computing and software tools delivered as Internet-style services. In artificial intelligence, the company scored a research and public relations triumph in 2011, when its Watson system defeated human champions in the question-and-answer game, “Jeopardy!” But IBM first applied the Watson technology to the daunting realm of cancer research, a lengthy struggle with little short-term financial reward. Today, IBM trails well behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft in the cloud market, according to analysts. Yet IBM has invested heavily in more than 60 cloud data centers in 19 countries in the past three years. And the most recent analysis by IDC, a technology research firm, and a report last month by Jefferies, a Wall Street firm, ranked IBM third in the category, ahead of Google. The Watson technology has been retooled as dozens of different services including text understanding, language translation, image recognition and sentiment analysis — all delivered via the cloud and available à la carte. IBM’s strategy is to offer businesses cloud computing, A.I. technology and industry expertise tailored for each customer. Big companies, said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM’s Watson and cloud businesses, are adapting cloud and A.I. technology to make their businesses faster and smarter. “We start from our strength in knowing how enterprises operate,” Mr. Kenny said. “We’re a trusted partner for companies in this data and A.I. wave.” Companies want to move quickly, Mr. Kenny said, but they often want to exploit the speed and flexibility of cloud technology from within their own computer centers, where they figure their vital business data is more secure. AT&T began a project with IBM last fall to accelerate the use of cloud technology in developing and updating the telecommunications giant’s 2,200 in-house software applications. IBM — a longtime technology supplier to AT&T — was chosen both for its cloud expertise and its industry knowledge, said Sorabh Saxena, AT&T’s president of business operations. The AT&T-IBM collaboration involves breaking down programs into cloud-based building blocks of code called microservices, each of which handles a certain task. So a new feature for mobile payments, for example, can be adopted quickly by updating a few lines of code rather than having to rewrite an entire program. Most of this business software uses cloud technology that runs inside AT&T data centers — in a so-called private cloud, in contrast to a public cloud in which computing services are delivered from remote data centers owned by another company. Many corporations opt for private clouds to house their most sensitive customer and business data. “For certain parts of our business, IBM was the ideal partner,” Mr. Saxena said. IBM emphasizes its hybrid stance in the cloud market, offering both private and public cloud technology to its corporate clients. In its financial reporting, IBM also includes all the hardware, software and services it sells to companies to build private clouds in its total cloud revenue, which would put it on a par with Amazon. Most industry analysts focus on the public cloud market, assuming it will grow faster as companies build fewer data centers themselves. In the public cloud market, IBM has revenue of about $2 billion a year, growing at 30 percent, according to the most recent estimate by IDC. By contrast, Amazon generates more than $12 billion a year and Microsoft about $6.5 billion. Yet for IBM, its underlying cloud software is crucial to building a big A.I. business with Watson. “IBM has a strong set of assets in A.I.,” said Ed Anderson, an analyst at Gartner. “And cloud is the answer to getting Watson in the hands of developers.” That was the appeal for Opentopic, a start-up that uses A.I. technology to mine online and corporate data for marketing insights. Opentopic switched from Amazon Web Services to the IBM cloud in 2015, largely to tap Watson’s code modules for text, image and sentiment analysis, so the Opentopic developers had to write less code themselves. “It allows us to prototype rapidly,” said Andre Konig, a co-founder of Opentopic. “And Watson is the artificial intelligence layer that makes that possible.” The start-up’s clients include Unilever, Abbott Laboratories and The Economist. Today, Opentopic does all its software development on the IBM cloud, but that will most likely change soon. It is working with a new company that runs its business on the Amazon cloud. “We need to be where our customers are,” Mr. Konig said. “The future is going to be multi-cloud,” meaning businesses will use various services. His comment points to a brewing issue for IBM — and perhaps one that will help determine the resilience of Ms. Rometty’s turnaround campaign. IBM is putting all its advanced technology on the cloud — not just artificial intelligence, but also blockchain and quantum computing. If others are leaders in the underlying cloud layers, why not focus higher up and distribute its leading-edge technology on other clouds as well? IBM says its Watson software, for example, is fine-tuned down to the chip level for the IBM cloud. But some analysts suggest that IBM may eventually take another path, working with Amazon, Microsoft and Google. “If IBM does that,” said Frank Gens, IDC’s chief analyst, “its chance of being a cloud leader goes way up.”\1.241974115371704,-1.8695307970046997,-0.5417243242263794,-0.9642841219902039,-0.40721023082733154,0.02965925820171833,0.7934538722038269,0.2180889993906021,-0.9818016290664673,-0.17709887027740479,1.006689190864563,-0.6683827638626099,-0.2617517411708832,0.06942059099674225,-2.0677709579467773,-0.5459721088409424,-1.1678615808486938,0.32770299911499023,-1.3575588464736938,1.2852747440338135,-0.753513753414154,-0.2661028802394867,0.5892009735107422,-3.2193281650543213,-0.7190900444984436,1.6566709280014038,-1.0876351594924927,-0.1617988646030426,0.6876381039619446,-0.6710082292556763,-0.32837778329849243,0.8889987468719482,-0.6105817556381226,-0.11072809994220734,-0.9098516702651978,-0.1696287989616394,0.6028809547424316,-1.0942217111587524,1.1633423566818237,0.06572074443101883,-1.9454586505889893,-0.8563128113746643,0.9147497415542603,1.0828371047973633,-0.18150028586387634,-1.8625519275665283,-0.3075275719165802,0.876452624797821,-0.8243345022201538,-0.24857154488563538,1.1770225763320923,-0.6571573615074158,-0.8498915433883667,0.6573783159255981,0.22953951358795166,0.5594373345375061,0.23525425791740417,1.315940499305725,1.2148375511169434,0.6060973405838013,-0.881151556968689,-1.0073992013931274,-0.5384788513183594,-0.8915661573410034,-2.6607718467712402,-0.05476440116763115,1.6005955934524536,1.3163148164749146,-0.7244008183479309,-0.3361682891845703,-0.6130282878875732,-0.9029644727706909,-0.21843019127845764,0.782033383846283,2.627352714538574,2.0227746963500977,-1.1084166765213013,0.4961489737033844,-2.1186439990997314,-1.3829987049102783,-0.2726513743400574,-0.3872387707233429,0.238047257065773,2.089791774749756,0.2880805432796478,0.6030055284500122,1.0835113525390625,0.43018144369125366,1.2866711616516113,-1.7842837572097778,0.1452828198671341,-0.013858035206794739,-0.36345595121383667,3.374276876449585,-0.8033305406570435,1.9499197006225586,0.4428693950176239,-0.16470353305339813,-1.4905141592025757,0.4947916865348816\NYTIMES\IBM May Finally Stop Shrinking.

1711\Technology\In a building that once housed a discount women’s clothing store and was the headquarters for the Zionist Organization of America, 12-year-old Carter Radmiller stood in a dark room, blowing away zombies. His eyes were pressed snugly against a virtual reality headset, and both of his hands gripped plastic controllers, while his avatar stood on a rocky outcropping, firing bullets and hurling grenades, dismembering the hordes of undead mutants that lumbered toward him from every direction. A few feet away, his mother, Eileen Radmiller, watched Carter’s progress on an enormous monitor. The two of them were in town from San Francisco for vacation. It was frigid outside, and they had spent the whole day at VR World on East 34th Street, which bills itself as “the largest virtual reality experience center located in North America and the Western Hemisphere.” Ms. Radmiller said this was their first encounter with virtual reality, and that they had played most of the dozens of games VR World has to offer. “It’s amazing how quickly he picks it up,” she said. While she watched the screen, a game called The Brookhaven Experiment told her son that he was 75 percent accurate with his weapons. “I know I shouldn’t say it because it’s so gory,” she added, “but the zombie game is probably my favorite.” VR World is one of at least seven virtual reality centers that have cropped up across the city in the last two years that allow anyone to walk in off the street and experience a technology that seems to be finally entering the mainstream. A Goldman Sachs report from 2016 compared virtual reality (“which immerses the user in a virtual world,” as defined in the report) and augmented reality (“which overlays digital information onto the physical world”) to “the PC and the smartphone,” and predicted that hardware and software sales could reach $182 billion by 2025. And this past June, the city announced a $6 million investment in a 15,000-square-foot “hub for virtual reality and augmented reality” at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, which the de Blasio administration says will create more than 500 jobs. Despite its promise, VR and AR technology is still evolving. The equipment is clunky and the setup is fairly elaborate. “It’s very expensive, it’s hard to set up, and there’s a learning curve,” said Igal Nassima, a programmer and the founder of Superbright, a firm that creates VR and AR experiences for a variety of clients. “It’s due to the commercial failure of the VR headset that you’re seeing these people use this moment to take the medium to the public,” he said. “It’s like the early days of PCs, where we had internet cafes.” Superbright recently developed an immersive virtual reality experience for the Museum of Sex, and Mr. Nassima described the challenges of introducing VR to the uninitiated. “You don’t know what you’re getting into; you have to have a certain amount of trust to go into this experience,” he said. When people put on the headset, Mr. Nassima explained, it’s isolating. “Even though they’re in a virtual world, they’re suddenly blindfolded.” “And it’s not very good for social settings, right?” he added. “Like, one of the most exciting things in an arcade is you want to hang out and talk to your friends. If you go to a VR arcade, you’re disconnected, you’re completely isolated.” To counter the perception that virtual reality is only for hard-core gamers, and to create a livelier atmosphere, VR World employs trippy lighting, ’90s dance hits, and a fully stocked bar. Guests sign up for different games and experiences by tapping an iPad. When one person’s turn (which typically lasts five to 10 minutes) is over, the next person in line (who has been given instructions by an attendant), straps on the headset and enters the matrix, whether it’s sky diving, rock climbing or slicing watermelons with a samurai sword. VR World is right next to the Empire State Building, and a steady stream of tourists flows through the two-story space. For sanitary reasons, visitors must wear white cloth eye masks to wear under the headsets, and many see little point in taking them off in between turns, giving the place an air that is both mysterious and goofy — Sleep No More meets Dave & Buster’s. If VR World and others try and cater to the public at large, Hubneo VR Lab, located on Suffolk Street on the Lower East Side, cultivates a more underground vibe. Industrial gray floors, harsh fluorescent lighting, and low ceilings make the ground-level space feel like the church basement it once was. There is no Top 40; there are no $12 cocktails. A couch sits glumly at the back of the room. A small translucent sign in the window lists the lab’s hours below a drawing of a neon-blue spaceship. But Hubneo offers what many other VR centers do not: custom-made racing machines, treadmills and a flight simulator to deepen the immersive experiences, which tend to last longer than a typical game. Climbing into the driving simulator transports you from Hubneo’s sterile confines into a rumbling car on a European racetrack, the growl of the engine blasting into your headphones. As the virtual speedometer climbs, a human driver’s jaw will clench involuntarily, or relax into a grin. The steering wheel feels heavy with the friction of the tires on the asphalt, and the machines are sensitive to what’s happening on the track. If the driver skids into a curve, the driver’s stomach lurches too. Nan Wen, 18, an attendant who was overseeing Hubneo on a recent Saturday night, assured the gamers that mild motion sickness is common for first-timers, though a customer has yet to actually throw up on his watch. “We have one regular who comes in, she can stay on the flight simulator forever,” Mr. Wen said, “but she can’t get on the racing machine.” Adam May, a graphic designer originally from Melbourne, Australia, said it was precisely these simulated G-forces that kept him coming back to Hubneo at least once a week. “These machines are the best that’s been built so far,” Mr. May said. “You ever heard the expression ‘flying by the seat of your pants’? You get all of the sensations on your bum, and you can’t get that on a normal machine.” Mr. Wen estimated the cost of one of Hubneo’s racing machines at around $15,000, and Hubneo is among the pricier VR spaces in town — $25 per experience, or $80 for four. At VR World, a two-hour pass costs $39. “People get to know about us from their friends and from the community of gamers,” Ilya Polokhin, Hubneo’s chief executive and founder, wrote in an email. ”We don’t rely on and are not really interested in random foot traffic.” Mr. Polokhin said that Hubneo has angel investors, which may help answer the question: Can virtual reality survive New York’s cutthroat commercial rents? Michael Deathless, one of the owners of another virtual reality space on Orchard Street, Jump Into the Light, said that the landlords on his block were expecting exorbitant rents. A 1,200-square-foot retail space next door is listed for $12,000 per month. “We just got a reduction, our landlord is so nice,” Mr. Deathless said. “But it’s still a ton of money. We are paying the bills, every week it’s getting bigger and bigger, but it’s a ridiculous way to try and make money.” Mr. Deathless, who is originally from Boston — and whose name is listed on his LinkedIn page as “Deathless” — said he is a software developer and compared Jump Into the Light to a kind of software incubator. He too, is working with partners and investors. “The people with an angle, they’re going to survive,” he said. “The people who just think they’re going to have an arcade and make a lot of money — it’s not going to happen.” Kishore Doddi, 36, who owns vrbar in Dumbo, said he has not taken on any investment money, and relies on curating larger corporate events and birthday parties to make rent. He noted that the first pop-up VR lab he started, in Park Slope in 2016, catered almost exclusively to families with children. Mr. Doddi said he wants to maintain that same inclusive spirit at his new location. “I do love VR, and I do think there’s something to changing people’s perception of it, and I do want to always keep it accessible to the public,” Mr. Doddi said. As for whether New York’s brick-and-mortar virtual reality spaces will remain fixtures of the city’s streets, or will go the way of the oxygen bar, Mr. Nassima, the VR programmer, said it depends on how quickly the technology can evolve. “The generalist arcades will slowly fade away,” Mr. Nassima said. A possible future may be unfolding in art galleries like Transfer, located in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Kelani Nichole, who runs Transfer, commissions virtual reality pieces from artists that push the boundaries of the medium beyond solo gaming. “I think we’re going to move past that really quickly,” Ms. Nichole said, “and we’re going to see more interesting ways for people to be more social with VR spaces.” Multiplayer VR experiences are still in their infancy, and are mostly geared toward seasoned gamers, but the possibilities seem encouraging. “What if you can go bowling with your friends in different locations across the world through VR?” Ms. Nichole said. “What does it mean to have a shared experience with another person and can that be fully virtualized?”\2.7294652462005615,-0.48973098397254944,-1.8104203939437866,1.0877677202224731,-0.04444829374551773,0.271771639585495,1.3658041954040527,-0.1615646332502365,-0.7509079575538635,0.2759632170200348,0.6978598237037659,0.45770758390426636,-0.43467170000076294,0.4389304220676422,-0.4001011252403259,0.08713829517364502,-0.20132070779800415,1.0262829065322876,-0.9314191937446594,-0.685793399810791,0.42077985405921936,-1.05391263961792,1.8181266784667969,-1.4731382131576538,0.22965267300605774,1.5731289386749268,1.373153805732727,0.12078852206468582,-0.31523361802101135,-0.7210842967033386,0.8105118274688721,1.9169788360595703,1.5079048871994019,-0.4128079116344452,0.08435560762882233,-0.8421978950500488,0.0967661440372467,-0.7490052580833435,0.8879915475845337,-0.3006456196308136,-0.6907462477684021,-1.2459768056869507,1.7737016677856445,-0.10923497378826141,-0.1238008514046669,-0.301005095243454,1.4451546669006348,1.4571651220321655,-2.1534605026245117,-0.7848199605941772,1.6247631311416626,-0.5650877356529236,-1.02293062210083,0.18561634421348572,0.31969916820526123,-0.25301679968833923,1.6547157764434814,0.9823703765869141,-1.2548432350158691,0.8501197099685669,-0.4187024235725403,-0.3566525876522064,-0.23437468707561493,-1.5988929271697998,-0.7550132274627686,1.0371984243392944,1.0088444948196411,1.209052324295044,-0.3335527777671814,0.6418660879135132,1.264783501625061,0.9300446510314941,-0.8833369612693787,-0.43195101618766785,-0.9869583249092102,0.19560684263706207,-0.7519899010658264,0.764116644859314,-0.6129897832870483,-2.048638343811035,-0.2594578266143799,-0.3158860504627228,-0.7549263834953308,1.3492132425308228,-0.3356983959674835,-1.099581003189087,0.3697201907634735,0.7620037198066711,0.17828865349292755,0.10176056623458862,-0.3828466534614563,1.8251018524169922,-0.32951119542121887,1.247874140739441,-0.5619431138038635,-0.04910308122634888,-1.3463176488876343,-0.1684921383857727,-1.8092788457870483,0.7100300788879395\NYTIMES\They Have Seen the Future, and It’s Wasting Zombies at the Arcade\2018-01-18 00:56:32.0\
1712\Technology\LONDON — Facebook said on Wednesday it was reopening and broadening an internal investigation into the possibility that Russia had used the platform to influence the British vote to leave the European Union. Reports that the Kremlin had used Facebook and other social media to try to sway elections in the United States, France and other countries have raised widespread suspicions that it had played the same game in the June 2016 British referendum. Russia has long viewed the European Union as a threat, and promoting the groups that favored Britain’s leaving would be one way to weaken the bloc. But the possibility of Russian interference has threatened to further complicate the torturous negotiations with Brussels over Britain’s departure, known as Brexit, by undermining the credibility of the referendum. After the British Parliament asked Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies last year for information on any Russian efforts to sway the vote, Facebook said in December that it had found no evidence of manipulation. But lawmakers complained that Facebook’s internal research had been inadequate, and on Wednesday, the social media giant acknowledged that its previous investigation had focused only on the Russian-linked accounts already identified by United States intelligence agencies as having been active in the 2016 presidential election. “Our investigatory team is now looking to see if we can identify other similar clusters engaged in coordinated activity around the Brexit referendum that was not identified previously,” Simon Milner, Facebook’s policy director for Britain, wrote in a letter to Parliament. Facebook faces a greater challenge in identifying potential Russian activity around the Brexit vote — if any exists — because British intelligence agencies have not identified a list of suspected accounts, as the American agencies did. “We would be very interested in receiving any information, including intelligence assessments or reports, that you and the U.K. government may have that is relevant to this work,” Mr. Milner said in his letter, noting that the inquiry “requires detailed analysis of historic data by our security experts.” Academic researchers have analyzed information from other social media platforms such as Twitter, where data is more accessible, and a few have found indications of Russian activity but not conclusive evidence. Many have urged more disclosure by Facebook, Twitter and other companies, which possess internal information about users and payments. A study by the Oxford Internet Institute concluded there was scarce evidence that the Kremlin had exploited the social media platforms to influence the British vote. Damian Collins, the Conservative member of Parliament leading the inquiry, said in a statement, however, that “companies like Facebook should initiate their own research into issues like this, where there is such clear public concern, and not just act on intelligence that has been passed to them.” “They are best placed to investigate activity on their platform.”\0.22595219314098358,-0.18991711735725403,-0.4538235366344452,-0.6222420334815979,0.8558648228645325,0.988685667514801,0.34481340646743774,0.08441007137298584,-1.0982987880706787,-1.1608885526657104,0.49896419048309326,-0.07124291360378265,-1.0016188621520996,-0.012983308173716068,-0.6911963820457458,0.03110208734869957,1.3103225231170654,-0.09923195093870163,0.054152533411979675,-0.1253652572631836,-0.5098889470100403,-0.26565682888031006,-0.26671162247657776,0.03829839825630188,-0.9549568295478821,0.8048668503761292,-0.3577963709831238,-0.9735916256904602,0.5863671898841858,-0.5482953190803528,0.3974052667617798,0.6667415499687195,-0.02842196822166443,-0.2947484254837036,0.16233257949352264,-0.439860075712204,-0.9457001686096191,-0.33733469247817993,0.47107720375061035,0.14402683079242706,-0.2069501131772995,-0.9042844176292419,-0.04994945228099823,-0.5230140686035156,-0.9342881441116333,0.026914343237876892,0.22740258276462555,0.814245879650116,-0.845554530620575,-0.38539376854896545,-0.16979938745498657,-0.816324770450592,0.8088751435279846,-0.02369331568479538,0.5200165510177612,-1.3233089447021484,1.03042471408844,-0.6267454624176025,-1.0650304555892944,0.6331157088279724,-0.19724467396736145,0.6602952480316162,0.8968300223350525,0.9627708792686462,-0.6128095388412476,0.34026023745536804,1.0685179233551025,1.5180481672286987,-1.4795196056365967,1.3750464916229248,1.1769698858261108,0.011691819876432419,0.0368366613984108,-0.8376479744911194,-0.0905180424451828,-0.13842350244522095,0.38630133867263794,0.2342318743467331,-0.12979437410831451,-1.150951862335205,0.33023157715797424,0.2991783022880554,-1.1863616704940796,-0.08399074524641037,0.777513861656189,0.4807386100292206,-0.19972287118434906,-0.44043415784835815,1.1468702554702759,-0.76151442527771,0.12147518247365952,0.6518558859825134,-0.8012161254882812,0.5764094591140747,-0.1876736730337143,0.4890548288822174,0.35416343808174133,-0.6185271739959717,-0.6556389927864075,0.8172759413719177\NYTIMES\Facebook to Take Broader Look at Possible Russian Role in Brexit Vote\2018-01-18 00:16:44.0\
1713\Technology\SAN FRANCISCO — The air has been swiftly leaking out of the virtual currency bubble. A decline in virtual currency prices that began before Christmas has picked up pace in recent days as concern has grown that governments could crack down on the new industry. For a time on Wednesday, the price of Bitcoin dipped below $10,000 — taking it down to about half what it was at its peak last month. Other virtual currencies have been falling even faster. Ripple, which was briefly second in value after Bitcoin, has lost more than two-thirds of its value from the high it hit early this month. The falling prices have been serious enough to prompt online posts with suicide hotlines for virtual currency investors in despair. The declines are likely to be particularly painful for people who took out debt to buy virtual currencies at high prices. Even the lows hit on Wednesday are still well up — some 1,000 percent — from where Bitcoin began 2017. But that is little comfort for the people who purchased late last year. One person on Reddit wrote about persuading family members to buy digital tokens late in 2017 and regretting it. “Fast forward to today,” the user, going by the screen name PM_ME_UR_ROOM_VIEW, wrote. “I opened my phone and I find a barrage of messages from them accusing me of scamming them and tricking them into crypto because they lost money, I tried to explain to them that this is normal and it will bounce back soon and it’s just a correction and don’t sell but they aren’t listening.” For skeptics of virtual currencies, the falling prices have provided some vindication. “Most people are buying Bitcoin, not because of a belief in its future as a global currency, but because they expect it to rise in value,” a note from economists at Capital Economics said on Wednesday. “Accordingly, it has all the hallmarks of a classic speculative bubble, which we expect to burst.” The pessimism in recent days has been fed by several reports that governments around the world were planning to tighten the reins on virtual currency trading. South Korean officials have said they were contemplating shutting down the virtual currency exchanges that have popped up over the past year. South Korea has seen the most frenzied surge of ordinary investors throwing their savings into Bitcoin and other digital tokens. The Chinese government has already shut down exchanges in China, but it was recently reported to be taking even further measures against new forms of online trading as well as Bitcoin mining operations in the country. Regulators in the United States have continued to crack down on smaller virtual currencies like Bitconnect, which has been described as a Ponzi scheme by many in the industry. Bitcoin, which began in 2009, has been through these sorts of wild swings before. The price spiked in late 2013 to above $1,000, before moves by the Chinese government sent the price sliding. It was only last year that the price again recovered to the same levels. Since that recovery, an array of virtual currencies have been on a nearly uninterrupted tear. With Bitcoin, investors have been betting that it could be a new kind of asset, outside the control of any government, something like digital gold. Investors have also been putting money into newer virtual currencies like Ethereum and Ripple, which were designed to do more sophisticated types of transactions than Bitcoin. The excitement has been amplified by hedge funds that were created in the last year to invest in virtual currencies and by Wall Street institutions that have expressed an interest. But investments in these new tokens have far outstripped their real-world use in the types of transactions for which they are intended. Ripple, for example, is supposed to help financial institutions transfer money across international borders. But only a few institutions have said they are using the currency, known as XRP, for that purpose. Some longtime virtual currency investors have said that a major price pullback was necessary after the hype had gotten so far ahead of the reality. “This is the ecosystem purging the ‘easy money’ crowd that arrived in past couple months,” Spencer Bogart, a partner with the hedge fund Blockchain Capital, wrote on Twitter. Prominent individual investors echoed that sentiment. “I usually recommend people to buy during dips like these if they were hesitant to enter the market before because you can get in on a discount,” said James Spediacci, who with his brother Julian runs an investment club for virtual currency investors. Monica Quaintance, lead engineer at a company working on technology related to digital currencies and an organizer of events for women interested in them, said investors should expect price volatility until there is strong government regulation. “People want to know that if they make a lot of money from Bitcoin they’re going to be able to keep the money,” Ms. Quaintance said. But for those less enamored of the technology, the declines are viewed as the beginning of an even steeper fall. “The latest price falls suggest that the bubble is bursting — although with prices still ten times higher than a year ago, they have a lot further to fall yet,” Capital Economics wrote.\0.17545905709266663,-0.19390104711055756,-1.1907453536987305,-0.6241046190261841,0.27836140990257263,-0.05021381005644798,-0.8384548425674438,-0.3440137207508087,-1.0125590562820435,-0.3278346359729767,-0.5367633700370789,-0.6373153328895569,-0.24658451974391937,-0.8832707405090332,-0.3510509133338928,-0.5276445150375366,-0.7190968990325928,0.5770019888877869,0.07409306615591049,-0.20939525961875916,0.3052540421485901,0.11605988442897797,0.17485158145427704,0.20099571347236633,-0.5951762795448303,1.1077821254730225,0.727361798286438,-0.8618703484535217,0.8108969330787659,0.5926769375801086,-0.749598503112793,0.8267965316772461,0.6188469529151917,0.9021593928337097,-0.829042375087738,-0.2691299319267273,-0.046366967260837555,0.5797829031944275,0.25557148456573486,0.6329898834228516,0.33878809213638306,-1.6538832187652588,1.0415904521942139,0.6931892037391663,-0.5173443555831909,-0.7397540807723999,-0.44664475321769714,0.6545519828796387,-1.1780619621276855,1.1780970096588135,0.12410078942775726,0.16335180401802063,-1.7880792617797852,1.259522557258606,-0.012382319197058678,-0.9713455438613892,0.7342069149017334,0.32138147950172424,-0.28698888421058655,0.7777774333953857,0.3437385857105255,0.20000752806663513,0.9063571095466614,-0.17774973809719086,-1.8390635251998901,-0.24730195105075836,0.8566845655441284,1.0114063024520874,0.16324035823345184,0.8966642618179321,0.5455082654953003,0.9223781824111938,-1.112511396408081,-0.3778614401817322,-0.42630940675735474,-0.095882348716259,0.16200490295886993,0.1923176646232605,-2.315922975540161,-0.5274868011474609,-0.8044572472572327,-0.2121148705482483,-2.3682730197906494,1.8318082094192505,-0.6291784644126892,-0.720579206943512,-0.5186716914176941,-0.02294502779841423,0.02712821774184704,0.4120404124259949,0.6566833257675171,-0.7424928545951843,-1.0265403985977173,0.40320754051208496,-1.1562118530273438,-0.002742784796282649,-0.336051881313324,0.3714255690574646,-0.6675211787223816,2.055473804473877\NYTIMES\Bitcoin Falls Below $10,000 as Virtual Currency Bubble Deflates\2018-01-17 23:32:38.0\
1714\Technology\How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Alexandra Alter, who covers the books industry for The Times, discussed the tech she’s using. Given that you write about the books industry, how do you prefer to read books? On a Kindle or iPad or some other device, or printed books? I came a little late to e-books, but I became a convert in 2010 when my older daughter was born. I needed a way to read books with one hand (and in a dark room), so I got a Kindle. The Kindle and ice cream sandwiches — also easily managed with one hand — are what got me through the brutal early weeks with a newborn, when you basically can’t put them down. Now I’m on my fifth Kindle. I still love print books and find it to be a much more relaxing and immersive experience, but when I’m reading books for work — honestly, the bulk of my reading — the Kindle is incredibly convenient. I have all my books on a single device that I always have with me. I read advance copies of books that way: Publishers send me digital copies through NetGalley or Edelweiss, sites where book industry professionals and critics can get digital copies of books before they’re published. I like that e-books are searchable, which is helpful for fact-checking, and the device stores all my notes and highlights, so I can quickly look stuff up when I’m writing. And I can read with one hand on a crowded train. One of my mild phobias is being trapped somewhere, on a plane or a stalled train or in a line, with nothing to read, and I also have the Kindle reader app on my iPhone, so I always have my entire library with me. How is technology affecting the publishing industry? About a decade ago, when Amazon introduced its first e-reader, publishers panicked that digital books would take over the industry, the way digital transformed the music industry. And for a while, that fear seemed totally justified. At one point, the growth trajectory for e-books was more than 1,200 percent. Bookstores suffered, and print sales lagged. E-books also made self-publishing easier, which threatened traditional publishers. But in just the last couple of years, there has been a surprising reversal. Print is holding steady — even increasing — and e-book sales have slipped. One possible reason is that e-book prices have gone up, so in some cases they’re more expensive than a paperback edition. Another possibility is digital fatigue. People spend so much time in front of screens that when they read they want to be offline. Another theory is that some e-book readers have switched to audiobooks, which are easy to play on your smartphone while you’re multitasking. And audiobooks have become the fastest-growing format in the industry. Social media has also had an enormous impact on publishing, as it has on all corners of the media industry. It has definitely become a new way for readers to connect with authors and discover books, but it has probably also cut into the time that people spend reading. (A depressing article in Quartz estimated that if people spent the same amount of time reading that they did on social media, they could read 200 books a year easily.) Many new authors are skipping traditional publishers and use tech tools to go straight to self-publishing their own e-books or print books. What will be the fate of traditional publishers in the next few years? Self-publishing has been one of the most fascinating corners of the industry to me. There have been a handful of massively successful self-published authors who have started their own publishing companies, and they’ve started to publish other “self-published” authors. But publishers have survived so far through consolidation, and we’ll probably see more of that. What will be the fate of physical bookstores? And what do you think about Amazon’s bookstores? Indie bookstores have made a surprising comeback in recent years (a trend that might be connected to the resurgence of print books). A lot of independent stores have been so successful that they’ve expanded into mini-chains. The future of Barnes & Noble looks uncertain, and the company has suffered setbacks after a few disastrous strategies. It made a huge and, in retrospect, unwise investment in digital hardware and its Nook device, and then tried to become more of a general-interest gift and toy and books store, which probably alienated some of its core customers. Lately, it has tried smaller concept stores, with cafes with food and wine and beer. There was some snickering online after its new chief executive announced that its latest strategy was to focus on selling … books. Snickering aside, I think it’s the smartest thing the company can do. In many parts of the country, Barnes & Noble is the only place people can buy books, and it’s still a beloved brand. Amazon’s entry into the physical retail space has been fascinating. I’m not sure how successful the experiment has been. When I visited the Amazon bookstore at New York’s Columbus Circle, it definitely felt like a device store that also sold books. The store even looks like a 3-D version of the website, with book covers facing out and curated sections that reflect what’s popular with Amazon’s customers. But they’re expanding rapidly across the country, so something must be working. I’ll be curious to see how Indigo Books, the Canadian chain, will do here next year when it expands into the United States. Maybe it will shake up the model. Outside your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with? I am, my family would confirm, not great with gadgets. It would be fair to say that I’m actively bad with them. I’m wary of some of the new home assistants like Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, not necessarily because I’m paranoid about my conversations being recorded — Amazon and Google already know everything about me — but because my kids would likely be yelling at the devices all the time, and the Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande songs would play in an endless loop. I have become a podcast junkie. I found The Daily to be habit forming. My other go-tos are Planet Money (disclosure: my husband is a reporter there), The New York Times Book Review podcast (where I sometimes appear), Longform, the New Yorker Radio Hour and some of the shows from Gimlet Media, like StartUp and Reply All. (Heavyweight, Jonathan Goldstein’s show, is hilarious and engrossing.) What tech is popular with your family? The one app that’s popular with the whole family is this Japanese game Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector. You buy virtual presents for these cartoon cats, which come and go as they please, and the cats leave you fish. You can’t really control the cats or win in any way. Just like with real cats, I suppose.\0.8744305372238159,-0.6569278240203857,0.5140644907951355,-0.5912533402442932,-1.246665120124817,1.7017207145690918,0.7383940815925598,-0.15079861879348755,-1.2395411729812622,0.4373086988925934,0.21256519854068756,0.36199113726615906,-0.9016834497451782,0.5414767265319824,-0.6115103363990784,0.24173925817012787,-1.1721168756484985,-0.04654209315776825,-1.262143611907959,0.5249711275100708,1.2474161386489868,-0.2629808485507965,1.086161494255066,-2.642559289932251,-0.5200905203819275,0.5413786172866821,-0.2751420736312866,-0.39455267786979675,1.2457364797592163,-0.04183356091380119,-0.45531949400901794,1.162672758102417,1.1902257204055786,-1.0408947467803955,-0.5349692702293396,-1.3382501602172852,0.18793238699436188,-0.6799322962760925,1.2610352039337158,0.035133544355630875,-1.0808229446411133,0.12952283024787903,2.0098137855529785,0.7057902812957764,0.6856134533882141,-0.48008641600608826,-0.32521048188209534,-0.21935154497623444,-0.8021855354309082,0.037067312747240067,1.704494595527649,0.48384782671928406,-2.5033600330352783,0.6627721786499023,0.684367835521698,0.07608669996261597,0.7137005925178528,1.0084326267242432,-0.10144121944904327,0.9059159159660339,0.03231760486960411,-0.24650496244430542,-0.06177987530827522,-0.9176934361457825,-1.289380431175232,1.0521414279937744,1.211709976196289,2.180830478668213,-1.4313092231750488,0.13427957892417908,0.8457545638084412,0.4888451099395752,-1.289790391921997,1.1797903776168823,0.435048371553421,0.851746678352356,-1.236541986465454,0.23473533987998962,-0.8834558725357056,-1.2895737886428833,0.5120397806167603,-0.11614737659692764,-1.5883281230926514,1.2322834730148315,-0.15992371737957,0.7539447546005249,-0.32989710569381714,0.807127833366394,0.7384330630302429,-0.0762517973780632,-0.6073623299598694,0.3003830015659332,0.9815270304679871,0.7731858491897583,0.5993486046791077,1.0883815288543701,-0.6588101387023926,-1.690866231918335,-1.9776824712753296,-0.4881994426250458\NYTIMES\Tech We’re Using: How Technology Is (and Isn’t) Changing Our Reading Habits\2018-01-18 06:07:40.0\
1715\Technology\Ross W. Duffin was wandering through a museum in Pasadena, Calif., last summer when he paused before a 17th-century painting of a bearded warrior in armor. “I thought, ‘Wow, that is really funny, he looks just like me,’” Dr. Duffin recalled. Then he moved on. But his wife, Beverly Simmons, was stunned by the resemblance. “She came running after me and said, ‘You have to come back and look at this painting!” Dr. Duffin said. Dr. Duffin had found his art twin. So the couple did what millions of people have discovered as a new way to interact with art — something that has exploded with new popularity in recent weeks thanks to a new feature in a Google museums app. But Dr. Duffin and his wife were pioneers last summer, using old-fashioned serendipity. He stood next to the oil painting, a work by the Dutch artist Jan van Bijlert displayed at the Norton Simon Museum. He turned sideways, raised his chin and narrowed his eyes. His wife captured the moment with her iPhone. Long before the Google Arts and Culture app, which became the most downloaded mobile app over the weekend, art aficionados, dabblers, narcissists and soul searchers pondering a cosmic connection to distant humans have been searching for their art twins, a long-gone, sometimes fictional or unknown doppelgänger encased in oil, sculpture or ceramics. Some set out specifically to find their twin, in an engaging pastime that gives museum visits a new focus. Others, like the Duffins, have stumbled on theirs as they wander. As anyone who regularly looks at a social media feed knows by now, millions more need never leave home or cross a border to find that uniquely familiar face on some obscure etching. They just upload a selfie and let technology do the sleuthing. The app was available in 2015, but its arts matching feature was introduced in mid-December. Its popularity has quickly surged, and Instagram, Twitter and YouTube users have widely shared photos of both their art twins and those of celebrities, from William Shatner to Taylor Swift. Google estimates more than 20 million selfies have been uploaded using the new feature. Dr. Duffin said he was amused by his moment with the unknown soldier, described by the museum as probably a more mythological than human figure. But the resemblance had an impact on his life after he posted the photograph on Twitter, where it was widely shared without identifying him by name. “A month later, all of a sudden, it started to get a lot of play in the press,” Dr. Duffin, a professor of music at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said in an interview. “I would get email messages from people I had not heard from in years who knew immediately it was me.” With people seeking selfies that make a connection going back in time, museums are using the opportunity to engage with visitors. Leslie C. Denk, a spokeswoman for the Norton Simon Museum, said the museum had noticed some visitors posting photographs of themselves posing like works of art, particularly alongside sculptures by Auguste Rodin and Aristide Maillol. “Art has the power to transport us through time, and so I think it’s a joy to recognize ourselves, a friend or even a pet, in an artwork from centuries ago,” she said. Art-twinning happens so often in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston that it hosts a fan favorite every week on Instagram. The most popular piece to pose with is “Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer,” a sculpture by Edgar Degas. “In our galleries, visitors frequently seek out their museum doppelgänger or attempt to mimic works of art — usually as they search for the perfect Instagram shot,” said Katie Getchell, the deputy director and chief brand officer at the Boston museum. At the Brooklyn Museum, selfies with artworks are also popular. “The success of Google’s project comes as no surprise to me, or probably to anyone else who works in a museum,” said Brooke Baldeschwiler, the museum’s senior manager of digital communications. “It’s really simple. People love to see themselves in art.” If human beings are obsessed with selfies, then the Google Arts and Culture app is the addiction’s enabler for the art world. It does have its critics. Some people just find facial recognition software creepy, and the app is not available in Texas and Illinois, which have some of the country’s strictest laws about the collection of biometric data, including selfies. The app also has mixed results, particularly when it comes to race, gender and age. “My grandmother got Ronald Reagan’s presidential portrait,” said Patrick Lenihan, a spokesman for Google. Far from the virtual realm, Greco-Roman antiquities, Egyptian funerary portraits and the contemporary people who resemble them are being brought together in an exhibit in Canada called “My 2,000-Year-Old Double.” The Musée de la Civilisation in Quebec City has narrowed down thousands of selfies to a few dozen people who resemble the artworks, arranging for them to be photographed in Montreal by François Brunelle, whose previous projects include documenting people who look alike but are not twins. Wesley Rowell, 57, who works in New York City, was one of them. He will appear alongside his art twin, a sculpture of an unidentified man from the third century B.C. “To think about the lives, the generations, between him and me in New York City, is kind of bizarre,” Mr. Rowell said. “I keep going back to that human need, to feel like I am connected to everything that was before me.” Amanda Bullis, 29, an actor who lives in Jersey City, was chosen for her similarity to a face carved onto a vessel, dating between 300 and 201 B.C. Ms. Bullis sat for hours for hair and makeup. “In that moment I was able to embody her,” she said, adding that it made her think about her ancestry. “I just found it interesting that I am part of a larger humanity that has been evolving and changing, but largely the same, over thousands of years.” Dr. Duffin, the Ohio professor, said he did not think much more about his art twin after he posed with the painting in California. He is accustomed, he added, to being mistaken for another bearded fellow. Strangers often ask him, “Has anyone ever told you that you look like Santa Claus?” he said. “And my answer is, ‘Not since yesterday.’”\2.1731343269348145,-0.11226939409971237,-0.14785803854465485,0.5832001566886902,-0.5795513391494751,-0.025839947164058685,1.683287501335144,-0.21428145468235016,-1.2320330142974854,-0.1856241673231125,0.10913398116827011,0.81886225938797,-0.5750502347946167,0.1662912368774414,-0.022310711443424225,-0.36160656809806824,-0.5752105116844177,0.9535149931907654,0.32461169362068176,0.4299025237560272,-0.557149350643158,-1.3458056449890137,0.03159267082810402,0.011131049133837223,0.05517341196537018,1.4736487865447998,1.439479947090149,0.7961841225624084,-0.6782218813896179,-0.3647845387458801,-0.2554418742656708,1.7168474197387695,0.03153226152062416,0.44340187311172485,0.34377408027648926,0.5335974097251892,-0.44890567660331726,0.7149435877799988,0.03381972014904022,-1.1873489618301392,0.36116987466812134,-1.2282731533050537,0.9606723189353943,-0.8246986865997314,0.3392528295516968,-0.3571472465991974,0.6533259153366089,0.026559386402368546,-3.221938133239746,-0.1604975163936615,1.1941883563995361,-1.5126317739486694,-1.1219710111618042,0.8430371880531311,0.9457322359085083,-0.7317332625389099,1.4877761602401733,0.5774643421173096,-1.4741551876068115,1.3333451747894287,-0.7109343409538269,-0.35859811305999756,-0.5561763644218445,-0.1386660784482956,-1.0051426887512207,0.6782923340797424,1.2601633071899414,1.2133985757827759,-1.8650802373886108,1.1507618427276611,1.4365332126617432,0.3176482617855072,-0.6283701658248901,0.20807179808616638,-0.7227729558944702,-0.2749566435813904,-0.13408608734607697,1.1307510137557983,-1.5207642316818237,-1.2597240209579468,1.2806602716445923,0.04597000032663345,-1.1262788772583008,0.974412739276886,0.7218940258026123,-0.7916666865348816,0.19064457714557648,1.6549832820892334,0.40007472038269043,-0.2785493731498718,-1.128889799118042,0.4871443510055542,-1.5942996740341187,0.372735857963562,0.32965174317359924,1.2165838479995728,-0.5559435486793518,-0.01795048452913761,-1.5953885316848755,0.7350450158119202\NYTIMES\Meet Your Art Twin: A 400-Year-Old With an Oily Complexion\2018-01-18 13:46:24.0\
1716\Technology\Q. I have a few programs in my Windows 7 Startup folder, but my PC is slow. I think there’s a lot more happening when the computer boots up. Is there one place to look to see everything that’s running instead of poking around in a bunch of different windows? A. If you want a detailed overview of all the programs, services, drivers, tool bars and other bits of code that start up along with Windows, Microsoft has a free utility for you. The program is called Autoruns. It has been around for several years and works on several recent versions of Windows. A page on Microsoft’s site calls it “the most comprehensive knowledge of auto-starting locations of any start-up monitor.” Microsoft’s site has a link to download Autoruns and brief instructions for using it after you install it. With Autoruns, you can see and manage everything that starts up with Windows. Click any of the various tabs at the top of the window, like Scheduled Tasks, Office or Internet Explorer, to see what is running in those categories. Right-click on an entry to get more information and a menu of actions. For the less technically inclined, Autoruns may seem like a bewildering eyeful, but the Microsoft Press site has a longer, illustrated guide to the software.

1717\Technology\SAN FRANCISCO — Google has been using artificial intelligence to build other artificially intelligent systems for the last several months. Now the company plans to sell this kind of “automated machine learning” technology to other businesses across the globe. On Wednesday, Google introduced a cloud-computing service that it bills as a way to build a so-called computer vision system that suits your particular needs — even if you have little or no experience with the concepts that drive it. If you are a radiologist, for example, you can use CT scans to automatically train a computer algorithm that identifies signs of lung cancer. If you run a real estate website, you can build an algorithm that distinguishes between living rooms and kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms. At least that is the pitch. “You don’t need a Ph.D. in machine learning,” said Diane Greene, who oversees Google’s cloud computing group. “But you can still build a highly accurate machine learning model.” Like many of the world’s largest internet companies in recent years, Google has begun relying on machine learning — computer algorithms that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing large amounts of data. These include systems that learn to recognize commands spoken into smartphones or translate one language into another. They also include algorithms that learn to build other machine learning systems. Google uses the technique while building systems that can recognize faces, products, landmarks and other objects in photos. In some cases, these algorithms are more accurate than something that is designed solely by engineers. The new service is part of a widespread effort to expand the power of modern A.I. to businesses that are largely unfamiliar with this rapidly evolving technology. Like Google, a New York start-up called Clarifai offers an online service that helps customers train computer vision algorithms. At the same time, several other start-ups, like Boston’s DataRobot and Silicon Valley’s H2O.ai, offer services designed to help businesses analyze the way products, customers, markets and employees behaved in the past and predict how they will perform in the future. “They aim to automate data science in general,” said Randy Olson, a data scientist at Life Epigenetics, a company in Portland, Ore. Tech giants like Google, Amazon and Microsoft have hired a large portion of the people who specialize in the machine learning techniques that are rapidly accelerating the progress of A.I. — a community of only 10,000 researchers worldwide, according to one estimate. That means most businesses don’t have the talent needed to explore the latest machine learning. The question is whether these new services will work as advertised and how rapidly they will evolve in the years to come. Google, Amazon, Microsoft and others already offer cloud-computing services that let businesses add existing machine learning algorithms to their own products. A company can take a Microsoft computer vision algorithm, for example, and slip it into a new smartphone app. But with its new service, Google goes a step further, providing an automated way for businesses to build new algorithms. Businesses can upload their own images, provide a list of objects pictured in these images and train their own computer vision systems, tackling tasks that aren’t necessarily handled by existing technology, according to Google. Initially, Google will open this service only to a small group of businesses. A Google product manager, Rajen Sheth, said the company would work with these customers to determine the price. Risto Miikkulainen, a professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin who has long explored the kind of technology that underpins Google’s new service, agreed that it had the potential to help other businesses build their own A.I. “It is really powerful technology,” said Mr. Miikkulainen, who is also vice president of research at Sentient Technologies. But sometimes, there is no substitute for good old human labor. With Google’s new service, humans must label the data before the system can learn from it. Google can provide the human labelers, as do companies like CrowdFlower. And even when an online service successfully automates a task, it’s not necessarily worth using. James Bradley and his London company, NMT Vision, once used Clarifai to train and operate algorithms to identify websites that are selling products that infringe on copyrights. But he and his company now handle this on their own, mainly because the cost is lower. Services like DataRobot and H20.ai may bill themselves as automated data scientists, but here, too, automation has its limits. “These services are only as good as their parts,” said Patrick Dougherty, a data scientist with the Seattle-based firm Slalom Consulting. “And humans still supply some of the parts.” Google says that once images are labeled, its new service operates without human involvement. In a matter of minutes, it can retrain an existing algorithm using the customer’s images. Given more time, it can build a model from scratch, specifically for the problem at hand. If you are a zoologist who wants an algorithm that identifies jaguars and giraffes, said Fei-Fei Li, chief scientist inside the Google cloud group, all you have to do is supply the right images. “You upload jaguars and giraffes,” she said. “And you are done.” All that remains is determining how well it works.\2.0173943042755127,0.21561114490032196,-1.4800381660461426,-0.2956441342830658,0.11658580601215363,-0.7152597904205322,1.199000358581543,-0.7758153676986694,-0.9335712194442749,0.27008333802223206,-0.09447309374809265,1.0850895643234253,0.06428675353527069,-1.31295907497406,-0.07117490470409393,0.633329451084137,-0.5877057909965515,0.07795657217502594,-0.5460603833198547,-0.8193336725234985,0.36020293831825256,-1.4079771041870117,1.0044771432876587,-2.2899856567382812,0.4094915986061096,0.47105076909065247,0.5829742550849915,-0.14737440645694733,0.5097388029098511,-0.729317843914032,0.0551881268620491,1.3391717672348022,-0.32707953453063965,-0.566601037979126,-1.260477900505066,-1.2264233827590942,-0.048640888184309006,0.2200026512145996,1.6321145296096802,0.45475444197654724,-1.484542965888977,-0.5394046902656555,1.382450819015503,0.22794203460216522,-1.338492512702942,-1.2261531352996826,0.0864955261349678,0.7137689590454102,-1.5393558740615845,0.7811784744262695,1.2150063514709473,-0.5909601449966431,-1.3568575382232666,0.38907915353775024,0.47080469131469727,0.7451366782188416,0.3939376771450043,0.327679306268692,-0.9055089354515076,1.1394917964935303,-1.056587815284729,-0.39643198251724243,-0.30034708976745605,-0.9151045680046082,-0.43943488597869873,-1.1747294664382935,1.174187183380127,0.8304862380027771,-1.2602651119232178,1.3222416639328003,0.6227319240570068,1.3504258394241333,-1.4636619091033936,-0.13138343393802643,0.868439793586731,0.7844037413597107,-0.6324202418327332,1.3061259984970093,-1.2565275430679321,-2.573944330215454,-0.24983106553554535,0.290513813495636,-1.5951402187347412,0.40378761291503906,0.4425787627696991,1.138304352760315,-0.04421904310584068,-0.36406466364860535,0.6842149496078491,-1.1575360298156738,-0.9990646839141846,0.7447600364685059,-0.4443580210208893,0.270826131105423,0.2790467441082001,1.0069668292999268,1.1919564008712769,0.6986995935440063,-2.3863525390625,0.18207648396492004\NYTIMES\Google Sells A.I. for Building A.I.

1718\Technology\DECADES ago, the brilliant satirist Tom Lehrer skewered the engineer’s willful ignorance of the consequences of his designs in a ditty about Wernher von Braun, the scientist who moved from Nazi Germany’s rocket factories to the United States space program. “Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down?” Mr. Lehrer sings. “That’s not my department, says Wernher von Braun.” But Mr. Lehrer’s target was bigger than engineers who could focus only on the research in front of them. There was no amoral approach to science, Mr. Lehrer reminded us. Seeing science and the tools and connections it provides as a good in itself is profoundly dangerous and wrong. Founded by young computer engineers, Facebook, Google and other Silicon Valley companies have been happy to view their powerful inventions as neutral platforms. Once the posts are up, who cares where they come down? These companies have converted an engineer’s disregard for real-world outcomes into a libertarian ideology that belittles the harms that stem from their platforms and rejects rules and regulations meant to prevent those harms. In a recent essay, Sam Altman, the president of the influential tech incubator Y Combinator, denounced “political correctness” as a danger to economic progress. “This is uncomfortable,” he wrote on his blog, “but it’s possible we have to allow people to say disparaging things about gay people if we want them to be able to say novel things about physics.” It’s easy to find similarly blunt statements from Silicon Valley leaders. For example, when a French official described her determination to encourage tech innovation without extreme income inequality, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen responded mockingly on Twitter: “Capitalism, without all that messy capitalism!” And when India rejected a proposal from Facebook to introduce a free version of internet access that was limited to Facebook and a small assortment of other sites, Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, responded more in sorrow than anger. “History tells us that helping people is always a better path then shutting them out,” he explained, gliding past the Indian government’s argument that introducing incomplete access to the internet was a worse path. But 2018, it seems, is going to represent what Silicon Valley would call “an inflection point” on the morality graph. Facebook is leading the charge, with the announcement last week by Mr. Zuckerberg that the company felt “a responsibility to make sure our services aren’t just fun to use, but also good for people’s well-being.” In practical terms, this means that Facebook will be reducing the amount of so-called public content — often provocative posts from businesses and news organizations — in favor of personal content, posts from friends and family. The public faces the unsatisfying question: Is it better to suffer an engineer’s neglect or an engineer’s concern? Since Facebook’s earliest days, Mr. Zuckerberg has been fascinated by the power to understand and manipulate users by applying algorithms to the data it collects. In 2005, speaking at Stanford, he described how he and a friend were “seeing if we could use the information that we had to compute who we thought were going to be in relationships. So, we tested this about a week later, and we realized that we had over a third chance of predicting whether two people were going to be in a relationship a week from now.” Through this deep knowledge of its users, Mr. Zuckerberg explained, Facebook could determine “what actually matters to each person on a more granular level.” More than a decade later, Facebook is still using these social-engineering tools to probe its users’ psyches. Now, however, the company, which reported $4.7 billion in profits in the third quarter, assures us that these tools will be refashioned to take account of the health of our society. In December, Facebook’s researchers tried to answer the question of whether social networks were a force for good and returned with a split verdict. “When people spend a lot of time passively consuming information — reading but not interacting with people — they report feeling worse afterward,” the company said. By contrast, “actively interacting with people — especially sharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions — is linked to improvements in well-being.” Mr. Zuckerberg says Facebook will be steering users to healthier interactions. “I expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down,” he wrote in a post on Facebook. “But I also expect the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable. And if we do the right thing, I believe that will be good for our community and our business over the long term too.” At age 33, Mr. Zuckerberg is already worried about his good name, but unlike past business titans — Rockefeller, Carnegie, Gates — he doesn’t think he needs to wait until after he has built his empire to do good. Mr. Zuckerberg says he is making changes to Facebook so that when his young daughters, Max and August, grow up, they will “feel like what their father built was good for the world.” So what does Mark Zuckerberg think makes the world good? In an open letter, published upon Max’s birth in 2015, Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, laid out some goals. First, was “advancing human potential,” which they described as “pushing the boundaries on how great a human life can be.” Most intriguingly, they posited that someday we could “learn and experience 100 times more than we do today.” The other was “promoting equality,” which they defined as “making sure everyone has access to these opportunities — regardless of the nation, families or circumstances they are born into.” Often, “access” appears to mean relying on the internet to provide an education or work opportunity. Connecting people is what keeps society churning, improving. “For every 10 people who gain internet access, about one person is lifted out of poverty and about one new job is created,” they wrote. Turns out, an enlightened, socially engaged Facebook has a similar outlook as the amoral, audience-seeking Facebook. Each sees connecting online as key to the good life. In other words, don’t count on Facebook to disrupt Facebook any time soon.\0.6252120733261108,-1.3269342184066772,-0.040692828595638275,0.07665479183197021,-0.5852919816970825,0.7376854419708252,-0.1836611032485962,-0.03552811220288277,-1.0744450092315674,-0.08658333867788315,-0.38220036029815674,0.36932194232940674,0.0885624811053276,0.6266809105873108,0.27478885650634766,-0.7799943089485168,0.7683252096176147,0.7334195971488953,-0.3928147256374359,-0.3568182587623596,0.6783221364021301,-0.8480104207992554,-0.07705217599868774,0.12263591587543488,-0.2739066481590271,1.1940282583236694,0.6426681876182556,0.6508336663246155,0.6348683834075928,-1.1250057220458984,-0.23365752398967743,2.0117950439453125,-0.3354703485965729,0.2711273431777954,-0.13472118973731995,-0.5819892883300781,-0.44733119010925293,0.4791650176048279,0.2896839678287506,-1.060628890991211,-0.23641178011894226,-1.0092812776565552,2.068608045578003,-0.09621501713991165,0.0763966515660286,-1.2903671264648438,1.159926414489746,0.07156510651111603,-1.6642179489135742,0.3252211809158325,0.313830703496933,-1.4586375951766968,-1.4573060274124146,0.41914501786231995,0.8095977902412415,-0.5301385521888733,2.0582385063171387,0.5490058660507202,-1.121026873588562,0.9865302443504333,-0.4612426459789276,-0.22143980860710144,0.3389594852924347,-0.7376461029052734,-0.8877268433570862,0.7061269879341125,0.24295766651630402,1.5728057622909546,-0.02149956300854683,1.4176369905471802,1.2366840839385986,-1.2387059926986694,-0.7774187922477722,0.589117705821991,0.41250017285346985,-0.20415493845939636,0.1658443957567215,-0.01138799823820591,-1.4389525651931763,-1.6493195295333862,0.2339170277118683,-0.080420583486557,-1.932466983795166,1.9447721242904663,0.24004237353801727,1.2237303256988525,0.047167301177978516,-0.041561491787433624,0.7862333655357361,-1.2581156492233276,-0.608795166015625,0.24293170869350433,-2.156418561935425,0.936188280582428,-0.40954524278640747,-0.05399858206510544,0.5664952993392944,-1.0558761358261108,-2.1428022384643555,0.8696057796478271\NYTIMES\Op-Ed Contributor: Facebook Doesn’t Like What It Sees When It Looks in the Mirror\2018-01-17 01:51:59.0\
1719\Technology\SAN FRANCISCO — The decade-plus evolution of YouTube from repository of cat videos and pirated content to potential TV replacement hit a road bump last year when marketers discovered their advertisements were showing up next to extremist videos and other unsavory content. Ever since, YouTube has been scrambling to come up with new policies that give advertisers more control over where their ads go and provide additional assurance that the videos on the online service are better screened. On Tuesday in a blog post, YouTube said it had altered the threshold for which videos can accept advertisements and pledged more human oversight of its top-tier videos. If that sounds familiar, that’s because YouTube has made similar promises in the past. “There’s no denying 2017 was a difficult year, with several issues affecting our community and our advertising partners,” Paul Muret, a Google vice president, wrote in the blog post. “We are passionate about protecting our users, advertisers and creators and making sure YouTube is not a place that can be co-opted by bad actors.” The recent uproar over a video of a dead body hanging from a tree in a Japanese forest, posted by the YouTube star Logan Paul, demonstrated that policing the platform remains as challenging as ever. The company said the YouTube Partner Program would now accept advertisements only for video creators whose videos have garnered 4,000 “watch hours” over the last 12 months and have at least 1,000 subscribers. YouTube said a four-minute video watched by more than 60,000 people would most likely surpass that watch hours threshold. The new standard is an update to a rule, announced in April, that said only creators with more than 10,000 lifetime views on their videos would be able to collect advertising money. YouTube said a standard based solely on views did not filter out enough “bad actors” and that coupling the watch hours with subscribers would make it harder to game the system. The challenge for YouTube is to make sure advertisements don’t show up next to troublesome content without cutting off the revenue stream of smaller video makers whose niche content helps make YouTube different from mainstream television. YouTube also pledged that humans would screen all videos from creators who are part of Google Preferred, which the company says is limited to the top 5 percent of all content on YouTube when measured by popularity and engagement. YouTube created the Google Preferred tier as a way to assure advertisers that they could place advertisements on the best YouTube content, while allowing creators to generate guaranteed revenue from videos. However, the content on Google Preferred has not always been very palatable to advertisers. Over the last year, Mr. Paul and another one of YouTube’s biggest stars, PewDiePie, were dropped from Google Preferred for posting inappropriate videos. In the blog post, YouTube said all of the Google Preferred videos in the United States would be vetted by humans by mid-February. The new monitoring system will extend globally by the end of March. While Google has long argued that the volume of video content on YouTube makes it hard to rely solely on human screeners, computers have not mastered the nuances required to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate content. In December, YouTube said it planned to hire thousands of reviewers to screen content on the site and remove inappropriate content.\0.5413822531700134,0.11371400207281113,-1.749772310256958,-1.1607500314712524,-0.341836541891098,0.29337984323501587,0.38002657890319824,-0.3625488877296448,-0.12810100615024567,0.6843158602714539,-0.5364181995391846,1.0033420324325562,0.4229719042778015,0.41880515217781067,-1.0269067287445068,0.949062168598175,-0.47542282938957214,0.5246387124061584,0.06970516592264175,0.3185696303844452,0.23038025200366974,-0.08871515095233917,0.3368931710720062,-0.23663270473480225,-0.23282648622989655,-0.06092780455946922,0.6715636253356934,0.4444113075733185,0.2677134871482849,0.07879415154457092,-0.6532151103019714,0.7470642924308777,0.18680565059185028,-0.5557190775871277,-0.6455516219139099,-0.6581456065177917,-0.7220820784568787,-0.2346915900707245,-0.045501161366701126,0.5633055567741394,-0.12243626266717911,-1.0098340511322021,0.606176495552063,-1.1606098413467407,0.06167087331414223,0.05640481039881706,1.0508322715759277,0.16349604725837708,-1.2231495380401611,-0.3879222273826599,0.9265691637992859,-0.23869508504867554,-1.5928469896316528,-0.5087604522705078,0.31967902183532715,-0.21607671678066254,0.53047776222229,0.10804574936628342,-0.5493676662445068,0.643345832824707,-0.27994564175605774,-0.029751189053058624,-0.3224274218082428,0.07293710857629776,0.05714906007051468,-0.8045945763587952,0.9910701513290405,0.7983938455581665,-0.8849761486053467,0.40092653036117554,0.6216839551925659,1.132080316543579,0.01921066641807556,-0.8312931060791016,-0.8877066969871521,0.2745421230792999,-0.4888109564781189,0.5055869221687317,-1.2562437057495117,-0.5866235494613647,-0.1804339587688446,-0.9071056246757507,-0.5455924868583679,0.6567875742912292,0.14251019060611725,-0.2076319456100464,0.8136803507804871,-0.3487226068973541,0.15342789888381958,-0.20867981016635895,0.23910146951675415,0.8594103455543518,-0.32458293437957764,-0.057687122374773026,-0.9032160043716431,0.6777060627937317,-0.2645561397075653,-0.5078979730606079,-1.2318665981292725,1.1257429122924805\NYTIMES\YouTube Adds More Scrutiny to Top-Tier Videos\2018-01-17 00:51:52.0\
1720\Technology\WASHINGTON — The legal fight against the Federal Communications Commission’s recent repeal of so-called net neutrality regulations began on Tuesday, with a flurry of lawsuits filed to block the agency’s action. One suit, filed by 21 state attorneys general, said the agency’s actions broke federal law. The commission’s rollback of net neutrality rules were “arbitrary and capricious,” the attorneys general said, and a reversal of the agency’s longstanding policy to prevent internet service providers from blocking or charging websites for faster delivery of content to consumers. Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the Firefox web browser, said the new F.C.C. rules would harm internet entrepreneurs who could be forced to pay fees for faster delivery of their content and services to consumers. A similar argument was made by another group that filed a suit, the Open Technology Institute, a part of a liberal think tank, the New America Foundation. Suits were also filed on Tuesday by Free Press and Public Knowledge, two public interest groups. Four of the suits were filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Free Press suit was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. “The repeal of net neutrality would turn internet service providers into gatekeepers — allowing them to put profits over consumers while controlling what we see, what we do, and what we say online,” said Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, who led the suit by the state officials. The lawsuits have long been expected. The filings on Tuesday, petitions to begin the suits, kick off what is expected to be an extended legal and political debate about the future of internet policy. Democrats have rallied to fight the F.C.C.’s repeal of net neutrality, which was passed in a 3-to-2 party line vote in December. The agency is led by Ajit Pai, a Republican nominated by President Trump. All of the attorneys general involved in the suit filed on Tuesday are Democrats. The lawsuits have the support of the Internet Association, a trade group representing big tech firms including Google and Netflix, giving the various legal challenges financial support and the clout of companies. The companies say internet service providers have the incentive to block and throttle their sites in order to garner extra fees. The F.C.C. declined to comment on the suits. But it did point to a part of its order that prohibits legal challenges until the new rules are submitted into the federal registry. The F.C.C. is expected to enter the new rules into the federal registry in the coming days or weeks. The states said they could file a petition to the United States Court of Appeals, starting the process to determine which court would hear the case. That is the action the attorneys general, as well as Mozilla and the Open Technology Institute, took on Tuesday. The states that signed onto the lawsuit include California, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts and Oregon, as well as the District of Columbia. Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general, said the decision to roll back the agency’s declaration of broadband as a utility-like service will harm consumers. “Internet access is a utility — just like water and electricity,” Mr. Becerra said in a statement. “And every consumer has a right to access online content without interference or manipulation by their internet service provider.” In a release, Mr. Schneiderman said the agency’s roll back disregarded a record of evidence that internet service providers’ could harm consumers without rules. A similar argument was made by Mozilla. “Ending net neutrality could end the internet as we know it,” said Denelle Dixon, Mozilla’s chief business and legal officer in a blog post. “That’s why we are committed to fighting the order. In particular, we filed our petition today because we believe the recent F.C.C. decision violates both federal law as well as harms internet users and innovators.” The issue of net neutrality has been fought in court challenges twice before in the past decade. The rules adopted in 2015, which set rules that sites could not be blocked or throttled, were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals in 2016 after legal challenges by telecom companies. The F.C.C. vote in December was to roll back those 2015 rules. The new lawsuits are among several efforts to restore net neutrality rules. On Tuesday, Senate Democrats announced they were one supporter away from winning a vote to restore net neutrality rules. All 49 members of their caucus, as well as one Republican, have signed on to a resolution to overturn the rules. A similar effort initiated in the House has the support of 80 members. Success by members of Congress is unlikely, particularly in the House, where Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, would have to agree to bring the resolution to a vote. The president will also have to agree to the resolutions, if they were passed, but the White House has expressed its support of the rollback of net neutrality rules.\1.013192057609558,-0.30408185720443726,-0.028216036036610603,-0.7384766340255737,0.3727692663669586,-0.02668921649456024,-0.4118462800979614,0.7567633986473083,-1.021819829940796,-0.992519736289978,-0.35412219166755676,0.5128713250160217,0.02492629736661911,0.09044980257749557,-1.8076833486557007,0.5879469513893127,-0.4818620979785919,-0.7791003584861755,-0.26510608196258545,1.0710735321044922,1.368661880493164,1.2278178930282593,0.16149397194385529,1.3972885608673096,-1.8085085153579712,1.0351983308792114,0.053253043442964554,-0.16252760589122772,-0.5427820682525635,-0.3428100347518921,-0.15929648280143738,0.22566084563732147,-1.6741511821746826,-0.9971978664398193,0.9114319086074829,0.25703805685043335,-0.2570670247077942,-1.8500267267227173,0.5335536599159241,0.04820618778467178,0.4922313690185547,-0.34574034810066223,1.4410912990570068,0.6159581542015076,-1.0910357236862183,-0.8403839468955994,-0.5380029082298279,0.26772627234458923,-1.1090015172958374,-1.458219051361084,-1.0610408782958984,0.6688690781593323,0.8964238166809082,-0.056723736226558685,0.4006957411766052,-0.38505083322525024,0.8415583372116089,-1.3494278192520142,-1.618177056312561,0.023691514506936073,-1.1579337120056152,1.2989978790283203,0.3613407611846924,1.2712135314941406,-1.31798255443573,1.0356760025024414,-0.2889068126678467,1.4787229299545288,-2.2867493629455566,0.9427247047424316,1.3559789657592773,-0.2604459226131439,0.44547194242477417,-0.40721219778060913,-0.37018123269081116,1.441009759902954,0.28519755601882935,1.0708757638931274,-0.5218861103057861,-0.53242427110672,2.2796945571899414,-0.8187660574913025,0.15393266081809998,-1.0418187379837036,-0.22287367284297943,0.9714643359184265,1.1697839498519897,0.08249777555465698,0.3181246817111969,-1.708373785018921,-0.6026847958564758,0.813850462436676,-1.5714329481124878,0.4689671993255615,-0.5545455813407898,0.24657566845417023,0.4766426086425781,-0.45694464445114136,0.3437827229499817,-0.7075400948524475\NYTIMES\Flurry of Lawsuits Filed to Fight Repeal of Net Neutrality\2018-01-17 00:51:27.0\
1721\Technology\WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats announced on Tuesday that they were one supporter away from winning a vote to restore the so-called net neutrality rules that the Federal Communications Commission rolled back in December. But even if Democrats win that vote, Democrats have a long ways to go before they are able to reinstate rules that prevent internet service providers from creating fast and slow lanes for online users. Here is a look at their difficult road ahead, and some of the motivations: What are the Senate Democrats doing? Senate Democrats said on Tuesday that all 49 members of their caucus had agreed to sign on to a resolution that would overturn the F.C.C. repeal of net neutrality rules. They are using a tool of the Senate, the Congressional Review Act, which requires a simple majority to overturn a recent order by a federal agency. The Democrats also have the support of at least one Republican, Senator Susan Collins of Maine. So that leaves them searching for one more Republican to join their effort to get the necessary 51 votes. “Given how quickly we have gotten 50, we have a real chance of succeeding,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said in a statement. If this passes, are the rules automatically reinstated? No. The House would have to pass a similar resolution, also using the Congressional Review Act, and the chances there are slim. Representative Mike Doyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, is leading the effort there and has 80 Democrats on board so far. But Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, could refuse to bring it to a vote. And 218 signatures would be needed to send it to the floor through a petition. Finally, the president would have to sign the legislation. That, too, seems unlikely, since the White House has said it supported the F.C.C.’s vote. When will the Senate introduce its bill? It could be months. Lawmakers have 60 days after the F.C.C. puts its December order in the federal registry to introduce their resolution. The agency hasn’t done that yet and could delay the process for several days and even weeks. If this is such a long shot, why are Democrats putting so much effort into it? Many Democrats would like to turn net neutrality into a bigger political issue ahead of the 2018 midterms. The efforts to overturn the F.C.C. order are aimed to raise awareness about an issue that has broad interest, particularly among younger voters, Democratic lawmakers have said. Consumer advocacy groups like Free Press, Demand Progress and Fight for the Future, have been singling out lawmakers who have either supported the F.C.C. order or have not spoken up in favor of restoring rules. “There will be a political price to pay for those on the wrong side of history. Momentum is on our side,” Mr. Markey has said. What are the other efforts going on around net neutrality? There are a few major fights underway to bring back net neutrality. On Tuesday, 22 attorneys general sued to block the F.C.C.’s repeal. The nonprofit Mozilla Foundation, the group behind Firefox web browsers, also sued the commission. More public interest groups and tech companies are also expected to take legal action. In addition, a few lawmakers have introduced bills to bring back rules.\0.869456946849823,-0.6470526456832886,-0.10886991769075394,-2.0578794479370117,0.8663702607154846,0.9998945593833923,-0.30656468868255615,0.13577613234519958,-0.19666121900081635,-0.7141823768615723,1.3319530487060547,0.6657257676124573,-0.5315727591514587,-0.4536016583442688,-0.6057857275009155,0.04222524166107178,0.1918386071920395,-0.0990622490644455,-0.42094287276268005,0.10064595192670822,0.1571369171142578,0.5705576539039612,-0.30463558435440063,-0.003607441671192646,-1.4597047567367554,0.07169518619775772,-0.3623668849468231,-0.5328329205513,0.008685149252414703,-0.19741272926330566,-0.18244962394237518,-0.5598025321960449,-0.9471052289009094,-0.9813675880432129,0.04848092794418335,0.461582750082016,-0.5600876212120056,-0.9651896953582764,0.8697174787521362,0.34966224431991577,0.17821453511714935,-1.783206582069397,0.20287896692752838,-0.15129727125167847,-0.976870596408844,0.6227027773857117,-0.6043816208839417,0.600189745426178,-0.5119062662124634,-0.7908814549446106,0.4075205624103546,0.2687806189060211,-0.6486009955406189,-0.01156044751405716,0.2984680235385895,-1.4824347496032715,1.141605019569397,-1.5823434591293335,-0.08325613290071487,0.2841514050960541,-0.8603161573410034,0.187804713845253,-0.1537245810031891,0.14496852457523346,-1.4076099395751953,1.2330185174942017,-0.41435033082962036,1.6357111930847168,-1.548599362373352,0.8861424922943115,0.6669274568557739,-0.9776735901832581,-0.28380632400512695,-0.3427738845348358,-1.9159049987792969,1.0282821655273438,0.020720653235912323,0.676129162311554,-0.7291992902755737,-0.5475412011146545,0.4409707486629486,-0.3658656179904938,-0.09612704068422318,-1.2522860765457153,-0.08530909568071365,-0.1191115528345108,0.9209299683570862,-0.06528881192207336,-0.27766114473342896,-1.059027075767517,-0.5958530306816101,0.6510379910469055,-0.928820013999939,0.45868173241615295,-0.7653640508651733,0.2688586115837097,-0.14744621515274048,-0.7504693269729614,-0.17295542359352112,-0.4073416590690613\NYTIMES\Senate Democrats Push for a Net Neutrality Vote.

1722\Technology\A company making “smart thermometers” that upload body temperatures to its website claims to be tracking this year’s flu season faster and in greater geographic detail than public health authorities can. This year’s flu season — which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers “moderately severe” — has left Missouri and Iowa the “sickest states in the country,” said Inder Singh, the founder of Kinsahealth.com. California has had its worst outbreak in five years, with nearly 1 percent of the state exhibiting flu symptoms on Jan. 2, he added. By contrast, New York, New England and the Southeast have had relatively mild seasons so far, but cases are rising and should peak in two weeks. Mr. Singh’s data paints a different picture from that of the C.D.C., which held a news conference Friday to announce that flu activity was “widespread” across the continental United States, which is unusual. (Hawaii’s outbreak is smaller, the agency said.) “There’s lots of flu in lots of places,” said Dr. Daniel B. Jernigan, director of the C.D.C.’s flu division. [READ: Questions and Answers About This Year’s Flu Season] Hospitalization and death rates, though climbing, are still lower than was expected, Dr. Jernigan added, even though most of this season’s cases are H3N2, which is typically the most deadly seasonal strain. Although 20 children and teenagers have already died of flu or its consequences, the 2014-2015 season — the one this season most closely resembles — killed 148. (This year’s final death toll will not be known until summer, because the deaths from lingering pneumonia may occur as late as June.) The C.D.C. data comes from hospitals and clinics that report how many cases of “influenza-like illness” they treat. Delays can result if clinic statisticians are busy or if state health departments do not pass on the figures quickly. Kinsa, by contrast, is able almost instantly to spot fever spikes in states — or even in cities and neighborhoods. More than 500,000 households now own its smartphone-connected oral and ear thermometers, Mr. Singh said, and the company gets about 25,000 readings each day. (Of course, the company cannot measure hospitalizations, deaths, or which strains of flu are circulating, or consistently distinguish flu from other febrile illnesses.) Kinsa’s technology was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2014 and gathered data in subsequent flu seasons; the company hopes to soon publish a study by outside experts assessing its accuracy in measuring the seasonal spread. Those experts, Mr. Singh said, found the data to be more accurate than Google’s Flu Trends, which Google shut down three years ago after it missed the peak of the 2013-2014 season. Google tracked internet searches for terms like “flu,” “fever” and so on, but could be misled by, for example, searches triggered by news coverage. Kinsa’s smartphone app uses a bubble game to entice children to take their temperatures. If fever is detected, it asks parents about other symptoms and then offers basic medical advice or urges the user to see a doctor. The makers of cold medications, disinfectants, toothbrushes and even orange juice buy advertising on the app, Mr. Singh said.\0.7078830599784851,-0.23168085515499115,0.6623856425285339,-0.46883687376976013,-0.04834384471178055,1.4462121725082397,1.163206696510315,-0.029614226892590523,-0.31622275710105896,-0.1856917291879654,0.4828525185585022,0.406615287065506,-1.32343327999115,-0.08154894411563873,-0.7372379899024963,0.15314391255378723,0.05056021735072136,1.0507010221481323,-0.21927247941493988,0.7144930362701416,0.05839602276682854,0.21722960472106934,0.3609038293361664,-0.618772566318512,0.020254453644156456,0.34099310636520386,-1.0906338691711426,-0.33095329999923706,-0.3863907754421234,-0.254649817943573,-0.31990474462509155,0.5952198505401611,0.20756414532661438,-0.0819525197148323,-0.057882796972990036,-0.6280482411384583,0.2948797643184662,0.1706840544939041,-0.3174334764480591,0.37058573961257935,-0.22563223540782928,-0.7218322157859802,1.2342699766159058,0.889505922794342,0.2888339161872864,-0.5997219085693359,1.3865011930465698,-0.9041638970375061,-0.6793087720870972,-0.5331684947013855,0.137450709939003,-0.5602880716323853,0.08978723734617233,-0.2923203110694885,0.13529659807682037,-0.6354610919952393,1.3016695976257324,0.10800686478614807,-1.1063697338104248,0.741607129573822,0.8514823317527771,-0.01910454034805298,0.529846727848053,0.9033520221710205,-0.18187975883483887,-0.1572917252779007,0.6640651822090149,1.505236268043518,-0.21489399671554565,0.22355405986309052,-0.20176200568675995,0.37848204374313354,-0.20558343827724457,0.09011556208133698,0.00187433953396976,-1.23759925365448,-0.5797396898269653,1.7327824831008911,-0.8633151650428772,0.045924365520477295,0.7462864518165588,-0.21198144555091858,-0.8740159273147583,1.5118504762649536,-0.268754243850708,-0.15306223928928375,-0.11430542916059494,-0.186773419380188,0.9552473425865173,-0.4451616704463959,-0.6024826169013977,0.43869879841804504,-0.835841178894043,1.0247291326522827,-0.22009843587875366,0.3149265944957733,1.1776758432388306,-1.799320101737976,-0.46710753440856934,0.6861391067504883\NYTIMES\Global Health: ‘Smart Thermometers’ Track Flu Season in Real Time\2018-01-16 08:00:29.0\
1723\Technology\SAN FRANCISCO — These days, you can find virtual assistants like Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Assistant in all sorts of things, from smart speakers and smartphones to washing machines and bathroom mirrors. The challenge isn’t finding these digitized helpers, it is finding people who use them to do much more than they could with the old clock/radio in the bedroom. A management consulting firm recently looked at heavy users of virtual assistants, defined as people who use one more than three times a day. The firm, called Activate, found that the majority of these users turned to virtual assistants to play music, get the weather, set a timer or ask questions. Activate also found that the majority of Alexa users had never used more than the basic apps that come with the device, although Amazon said its data suggested that four out of five registered Alexa customers have used at least one of the more than 30,000 “skills” — third-party apps that tap into Alexa’s voice controls to accomplish tasks — it makes available. But while some hard-core fans are indeed tapping into advanced features of virtual assistants, like controlling the lights in their homes, for the most part, “people are still using these speakers for very routine tasks,” said Michael J. Wolf, the founder of Activate. “It’s not clear that there is something that’s going to drive people to use these.” Apple popularized the virtual assistant concept in 2011 when it introduced technology called Siri in its iPhones. About three years later, Amazon debuted the Echo, a speaker packed with microphones to capture and decipher what we’re saying to Alexa. Soon, various technology companies were betting that speaking to machines through virtual assistants would be an essential way for consumers to interact with devices and services in the future. There is a reason tech companies think virtual assistants are so important: They want to control an indispensable “platform” — a crucial piece of technology other services or devices must rely upon. Some believe virtual assistant technology can be that sort of platform, and the company with the most useful assistant will gain an advantage for their other services — like internet search or online shopping. Lose that competition, however, and a company could be at the mercy of its rivals. With those stakes in mind, tech giants have been scrambling to make their assistants omnipresent. Since smart speakers are the main way for people to deal with virtual assistants, Amazon and Google stoked holiday sales with heavy discounts, dropping the price of their entry-level models to $30, from $50. At the same time, tech companies have been putting their assistants inside products of all shapes and sizes. Before last week’s International CES tech conference in Las Vegas, Amazon announced a string of new Alexa partnerships. Hisense will put the assistant into its television sets, while Kohler said a new bathroom mirror will have built-in microphones so people can use Alexa to dim the lights and fill a bathtub using voice commands. PC makers like HP, Asus and Acer said they were integrating Alexa into their computers, while Panasonic, Garmin and other electronics makers will do the same for devices that go into cars. Amazon also announced an agreement with Toyota to integrate Alexa into some Toyota and Lexus vehicles. Ditto for a new smoke alarm from First Alert. Google said LG Televisions, headphones from Sony and smart displays from Lenovo will tap into its Assistant. For now, consumers’ satisfaction with their smart speakers — and by extension, the onboard assistants — is helped in part by the fact they didn’t pay a lot to get them into their homes. Justin Hosseininejad, an engineering consultant from Medina, Ohio, said he bought his first Amazon Echo Dot for $50 last year and got a second one free a few months ago with another internet-connected device, the Nest thermostat. He uses them to listen to news in the morning and play music throughout the day. He recognizes that he’s not asking Alexa to do a lot, but considering how little he paid, he is fine with that. “There’s only certain things I use it for, but I’m happy with it,” he said. “I’m not doing my taxes with it.” Paul Erickson, a senior analyst at the research firm IHS Markit, said the next step for these devices will be to become the hub of a connected home, controlling internet-connected lights, thermostats and other basic home appliances. “The more interesting functionality is yet to come,” Mr. Erickson said. “Part of that will come as more integration happens this year and next year. This is the first year we’re going to see real advances with the assistants because of competition in the marketplace.” Competitors of Google and Amazon are also spreading their assistants far and wide. Apple now has Siri running across its universe of devices, along with an upcoming smart speaker called HomePod. Samsung has its own assistant, Bixby, available in its phones and televisions, and Microsoft has Cortana as a feature built into its Windows software. Amazon has turned its Echo family of products and the Alexa assistant that powers them into the unlikeliest of success stories — although it is hard to say exactly how successful because it shrouds its disclosures about devices sales in fuzzy language. Amazon would say only that it sold “tens of millions” of Alexa devices during the recent holiday season, millions more than the same period last year. Analysts estimate that Echo accounts for over 70 percent of sales in the smart speaker category, with Google a distant second. Google was also coy about revealing exact sales of Google Home. In a statement on Jan. 5, Google announced it has sold one Google Home smart speaker every second since it started shipping a smaller version of voice-controlled device on October 19 — or about 79 days. That works out to roughly seven million units. In the 20 months since it first started making the Google Assistant available as part of its Allo messaging app, Google said its Assistant is now accessible on more than 400 million devices including washing machines, dryers, air-conditioners, refrigerators and dishwashers from LG, headphones from Bose and a range of speakers from 15 different companies. Google said the Assistant can now accomplish more than one million tasks, or “actions,” such as asking for photos from Halloween or adding events to a calendar. It created a directory — searchable, of course — to highlight these capabilities, hoping to remind users that the Assistant can do more than set a timer. There are signs that some consumers are starting to recognize the value of virtual assistants even if they aren’t interested in smart speakers. Mr. Hosseininejad’s friend Stephen Melik, also an engineer from Ohio, said he uses Siri on his Apple Watch and iPhone to control his lights and power switches. But the notion of a stand-alone smart speaker that remains in one place doesn’t make sense to him. “I’ve always viewed these smart speakers as a solution searching for a problem,” he said. “But the voice assistants, potentially there are a lot of benefits to it.”\0.7869648337364197,0.5032196640968323,-0.5324354767799377,-0.6699686050415039,-0.5825619101524353,0.5696771144866943,1.4711527824401855,-0.526071310043335,-0.3444993495941162,-0.3316743075847626,1.0085077285766602,0.7870486974716187,-1.3338998556137085,-0.01321440376341343,-0.5813860893249512,0.09112248569726944,-1.2800164222717285,1.0993744134902954,-0.998301088809967,-0.38883060216903687,0.6683059334754944,-1.167829990386963,1.247944951057434,-0.8846525549888611,0.602514386177063,0.8979988694190979,1.2380532026290894,1.0396308898925781,-0.37380099296569824,0.04784800112247467,0.08120466768741608,1.799655795097351,0.9196740984916687,-0.6829258799552917,-0.6580420732498169,-1.1533622741699219,0.6887485384941101,-0.8517622947692871,0.4436904191970825,0.2747792601585388,-0.09530270844697952,-0.5561666488647461,1.3798166513442993,0.7283585667610168,-1.0816606283187866,-1.3365386724472046,0.23583047091960907,-0.6894598603248596,-1.9194360971450806,0.4771268367767334,1.8080627918243408,-0.9960951209068298,-1.3021173477172852,0.8807682991027832,1.1995471715927124,-1.4175266027450562,0.5661515593528748,0.5956029295921326,-1.964662790298462,0.17402012646198273,-0.17323116958141327,0.14692896604537964,-0.3942129909992218,-1.2382835149765015,-0.5061177015304565,0.5887317657470703,0.4911624491214752,2.7911171913146973,-0.9983429908752441,0.43093380331993103,1.1013429164886475,0.2039499431848526,-0.9998162984848022,0.7351061701774597,0.09319815039634705,-0.7215706706047058,-1.01698637008667,-0.5693616271018982,-0.6388710141181946,-1.809960126876831,0.7971957921981812,0.24144257605075836,-0.4578797519207001,1.7117608785629272,0.7011841535568237,-0.8738000988960266,0.5919308066368103,-0.24371884763240814,1.0633240938186646,-0.46953508257865906,-0.42906007170677185,0.1743813455104828,-1.1301270723342896,-0.040808793157339096,-1.7519234418869019,0.3537970781326294,0.20348487794399261,-0.11501148343086243,-1.1410691738128662,0.5459907054901123\NYTIMES\Alexa, We’re Still Trying to Figure Out What to Do With You\2018-01-15 23:08:38.0\
1724\Technology\Q. Is it safe to install the Windows patch for these new Spectre and Meltdown bugs? Do they affect Linux? (And who names these security flaws, anyway?) A. Meltdown and Spectre, the two recently announced security flaws that can expose personal data to hackers, could potentially affect Linux systems, along with computers and devices running Windows, Mac and other operating-system software. These new bugs are actually in the computer’s hardware — specifically, in the central processing unit. Check Microsoft’s support site for the absolute latest news, but the company previously warned that its updates for Windows 7 and Windows 10 can conflict with certain antivirus programs; users should contact those software makers about updates. Early reports that the Windows patches were causing severe problems on computers with AMD processors prompted Microsoft to temporarily halt updates to many of those systems for a few days. The software fixes are expected to make the computer run more slowly, but Microsoft has noted that newer processors running Windows 10 should feel the least impact. The Meltdown vulnerability exists in laptops, desktops and cloud-based computers running most types of Intel processors made since 1995. The Spectre flaw can affect those same systems as well, but also smartphones, tablets and other gadgets running on processors made by other companies, including AMD and ARM. To find out details for your particular system, Graz University of Technology’s “Meltdown and Spectre” site at https://meltdownattack.com has an extensive collection of links to information about patches from most major hardware and software makers, including several Linux companies. Intel also has a page on its site with links and information about updates. As for the origin of the names assigned to these bugs, the “Meltdown and Spectre” site has an explanation. Meltdown gets is name because it “basically melts security boundaries which are normally enforced by the hardware.” Spectre’s moniker is “based on the root cause, speculative execution,” and as the researchers note, “As it is not easy to fix, it will haunt us for quite some time.”\0.9335088133811951,0.08363685011863708,0.34310945868492126,-1.0292376279830933,0.660169243812561,0.5027285218238831,0.5159029364585876,-0.1590074896812439,-0.2264639437198639,-0.37745869159698486,-0.2839665114879608,0.3660142421722412,-0.42965295910835266,0.7467278242111206,0.41858914494514465,0.5611180663108826,-0.07333964109420776,0.5033507943153381,0.4041033983230591,0.9723207950592041,0.4391719102859497,-0.2398541271686554,1.2488070726394653,-0.026115156710147858,0.6189364790916443,0.3808348476886749,0.6266139149665833,-0.15424597263336182,0.5715686678886414,0.7858996391296387,5.049884784966707E-4,0.2629261016845703,-0.43126147985458374,-0.7519378066062927,0.29668012261390686,-0.04383819177746773,-0.06638327240943909,0.08773922175168991,0.10273460298776627,0.6602965593338013,-0.77176833152771,-0.8313533663749695,0.7378960251808167,-0.4056912660598755,-0.6562959551811218,-0.21223106980323792,0.6054928302764893,-0.05591089278459549,-1.1790094375610352,0.24854952096939087,0.017693636938929558,0.20638202130794525,-0.2919653654098511,-0.18835924565792084,0.5901385545730591,-0.2554815709590912,-0.07913101464509964,0.2887547016143799,0.5727429389953613,0.4981222152709961,0.07557383179664612,-0.414646178483963,-0.647932767868042,0.027100639417767525,0.0870264396071434,-0.3060351312160492,1.1628574132919312,1.2814995050430298,-1.3496277332305908,0.32806527614593506,0.7827984690666199,0.06440691649913788,-0.0430593267083168,-0.03888591006398201,-0.4706728458404541,-0.4799911677837372,-0.80880206823349,0.17686809599399567,-0.6944255828857422,0.15442287921905518,0.750328004360199,-0.19547812640666962,0.010593117214739323,0.42682182788848877,0.618899941444397,-0.17755673825740814,0.3708000183105469,0.24344880878925323,0.11082540452480316,-0.4818829894065857,-0.504176676273346,0.9934723377227783,-0.5059673190116882,0.8067325353622437,0.048646628856658936,-0.1468205451965332,-0.05219748988747597,-0.20644716918468475,-0.6943862438201904,-0.059729836881160736\NYTIMES\Tech Tip: Keeping Up With the Meltdown and Spectre Bugs\2018-01-15 22:23:55.0\
1725\Technology\Graydon Carter, the former editor of Vanity Fair, was preparing coq au vin in Provence, France, the other day when he picked up a telephone call from back home. “We’re just cooking,” Mr. Carter said, affably, as the sounds of family chimed in the background. This is what semiretirement looks like for Mr. Carter, a bon vivant who is taking what he has called a six-month “garden leave” in France after 25 years as one of America’s most influential magazine editors. He keeps up with the news in the London dailies, has found himself bombarded by Johnny Hallyday tributes in the French press and started reading Michael Wolff’s book, “Fire & Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” before giving up halfway through. “It was too depressing,” Mr. Carter said. “It’s what I got away from.” He is not, however, staying idle. Mr. Carter, who has produced films and opened restaurants, said he was exploring a suite of new ventures — the first of which is set to debut on Monday. Zig, an app that aims to simplify users’ consumption of news, is Mr. Carter’s first public project since he left Vanity Fair last month. It resembles an Instagram of news: a feed of photographs culled from stories around the web, with the material tailored to a user’s interests. The idea, said Joshua James, one of the founders, is to deliver useful news without making readers slog through a dozen sites. “I had been going to the same 15 websites for years, and they never knew what I wanted when I got there,” he said. Mr. Carter offered advice — when the founders considered changing their logo, Mr. Carter said he liked the old one, so it stayed — but his most significant contribution was financial. He is one of several high-profile investors in Zig, along with the music producer Quincy Jones, the Hollywood mogul Ron Meyer and the concert giant Live Nation. Zig declined to disclose how much it had raised. Mr. James and a co-founder, Adam Platzner, pitched the idea to Mr. Carter at a tech-industry conference hosted by Vanity Fair in 2016. (The third founder is John Tornow.) At the time, Mr. Carter was mulling the state of news; he recalled an assistant pointing out to him that millennials “think in more visual terms, than in textual terms.” “That sort of sat with me for a bit,” Mr. Carter said. “And then when Josh and Adam came in and saw me and explained Zig, I thought this goes right to that.” Mr. James worked in the music industry, selling a digital start-up to Warner Music Group. Mr. Platzner worked briefly at Condé Nast before investing in media ventures like The Infatuation, a restaurant recommendation site. He is also a founder of Dream Water, a liquid soporific meant as a kind of reverse Red Bull. Over lunch last week at the Lamb’s Club — once a popular dining spot for Condé Nast brass — the founders said that the presentation of news in Zig matched the smartphone habits of a younger generation steeped in Instagram. “For millennials, we’ve built a delivery system that is familiar,” Mr. James said. The photos that appear in a Zig feed double as links to the underlying articles, a referral system that the founders say could lead to revenue-sharing agreements with news sites. Users can also flip through dozens of photos inside the app, an ad-free way to quickly consume pop culture slide shows from sites like T.M.Z. and PopSugar. The app was originally designed for entertainment news, but Mr. Carter suggested that the founders broaden the scope. “People follow Kellyanne Conway the way they follow Kim Kardashian,” Mr. James said, recalling a lesson from Mr. Carter. Each user’s feed is customized, with the mix of subjects (politics, pop culture) and celebrities (movie stars, members of the Trump administration) determined by his social media activity. Users can also share articles with friends, superimposing a photograph of themselves reacting to a story — a thumbs-up for a Time’s Up pin, for instance. While honing the idea, the members of the Zig team received coveted invites to last year’s Vanity Fair Oscar party in Beverly Hills, Calif. “It’s been fun,” Mr. Platzner said. “Graydon’s been good to us.” Mr. Carter said that the founders “have a very good chance of creating something that has lasting value.” But the former magazine editor said that he was setting his own ambitions beyond the media realm. “This is more of an outlier to what I will be planning over the next six months,” he said. “This is not my life’s work going forward. But I’m willing to help them in any possible way I can.” Any details about those other projects? Mr. Carter demurred. “I’m still in the planning stages,” Mr. Carter said, before excusing himself for his evening meal. “I may wind up running a pig farm here in France.”\1.375897765159607,-0.7144660949707031,-0.10511036962270737,-0.38841164112091064,0.6241530179977417,-0.9334887266159058,0.9689831137657166,0.30139145255088806,-1.2224291563034058,-0.7150022983551025,0.21276254951953888,0.7373567819595337,0.5349662899971008,0.7040504217147827,-0.8569719195365906,-0.6584152579307556,-0.2898847460746765,0.676243782043457,-0.47533658146858215,-0.36962151527404785,-0.44187718629837036,-1.2417664527893066,-1.4083071947097778,-0.39475083351135254,-0.5457618236541748,0.8387754559516907,1.5289820432662964,0.7713195085525513,-0.9258970618247986,-0.4730958044528961,1.888526201248169,1.3548678159713745,0.08854369074106216,0.1217343881726265,-0.04509911686182022,-0.6952884793281555,-0.6157971620559692,0.42313823103904724,0.3743492066860199,-0.21709251403808594,-0.04637843742966652,-0.9323475956916809,0.7094060778617859,-0.8890883922576904,0.3644455075263977,-0.4306672513484955,-0.6147434115409851,0.17126920819282532,-1.400073766708374,-0.2996872365474701,2.0493717193603516,-1.9170165061950684,0.11620846390724182,2.4103713035583496,1.4951444864273071,-0.634854793548584,1.741393804550171,2.5143957138061523,-1.119004249572754,1.467106580734253,-0.16823911666870117,0.627451479434967,-0.559711754322052,-0.9171801209449768,-0.1817476749420166,1.1673967838287354,0.8500726819038391,1.1252062320709229,-1.224374771118164,1.7942463159561157,0.8386456370353699,0.8933782577514648,-0.7154381275177002,-0.2761371433734894,-0.5332249402999878,1.1017431020736694,-0.5410795211791992,-1.2042796611785889,-0.8991765975952148,-1.2237529754638672,0.2868053913116455,1.140523076057434,-1.0075328350067139,0.946976900100708,0.7859766483306885,0.9352598190307617,0.9299390316009521,0.45936453342437744,0.2673032879829407,-0.7455336451530457,0.44690364599227905,1.5906174182891846,-0.8706828355789185,-0.21486139297485352,-0.09912598133087158,-0.04360341280698776,-1.3439840078353882,-0.03718036040663719,-1.3811415433883667,-0.17118389904499054\NYTIMES\Graydon Carter, Ex-Editor of Vanity Fair, Invests in an App\2018-01-15 01:00:14.0\
1726\Technology\SAN FRANCISCO — For years, tech industry financiers showed little interest in start-up companies that made computer chips. How on earth could a start-up compete with a goliath like Intel, which made the chips that ran more than 80 percent of the world’s personal computers? Even in the areas where Intel didn’t dominate, like smartphones and gaming devices, there were companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia that could squash an upstart. But then came the tech industry’s latest big thing — artificial intelligence. A.I., it turned out, works better with new kinds of computer chips. Suddenly, venture capitalists forgot all those forbidding roadblocks to success for a young chip company. Today, at least 45 start-ups are working on chips that can power tasks like speech and self-driving cars, and at least five of them have raised more than $100 million from investors. Venture capitalists invested more than $1.5 billion in chip start-ups last year, nearly doubling the investments made two years ago, according to the research firm CB Insights. The explosion is akin to the sudden proliferation of PC and hard-drive makers in the 1980s. While these are small companies, and not all will survive, they have the power to fuel a period of rapid technological change. It is doubtful that any of the companies fantasize about challenging Intel head-on with their own chip factories, which can take billions of dollars to build. (The start-ups contract with other companies to make their chips.) But in designing chips that can provide the particular kind of computing power needed by machines learning how to do more and more things, these start-ups are racing toward one of two goals: Find a profitable niche or get acquired. Fast. “Machine learning and A.I. has reopened questions around how to build computers,” said Bill Coughran, who helped oversee the global infrastructure at Google for several years and is now a partner at Sequoia, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm. Sequoia has invested in Graphcore, a British start-up that recently joined the $100 million club. By the summer of 2016, the change was apparent. Google, Microsoft and other internet giants were building apps that could instantly identify faces in photos and recognize commands spoken into smartphones by using algorithms, known as neural networks, that can learn tasks by identifying patterns in large amounts of data. Nvidia was best known for making graphics processing units, or G.P.U.s, which were designed to help render complex images for games and other software — and it turned out they worked really well for neural networks, too. Nvidia sold $143 million in chips for the massive computer data centers run by companies like Google in the year leading up to that summer — double the year before. Intel scrambled to catch up. It acquired Nervana, a 50-employee Silicon Valley start-up that had started building an A.I. chip from scratch, for $400 million, according to a report from the tech news site Recode. After that, a second Silicon Valley start-up, Cerebras, grabbed five Nervana engineers as it, too, designed a chip just for A.I. By early 2018, according to a report by Forbes, Cerebras had raised more than $100 million in funding. So had four other firms: Graphcore; another Silicon Valley outfit, Wave Computing; and two Beijing companies, Horizon Robotics and Cambricon, which is backed by the Chinese government. Raising money in 2015 and early 2016 was a nightmare, said Mike Henry, chief executive at the A.I. chip start-up Mythic. But “with the big, aquisition-hungry tech companies all barreling toward semiconductors,” that has changed, he said. China has shown a particular interest in developing new A.I. chips. A third Beijing chip start-up, DeePhi, has raised $40 million, and the country’s Ministry of Science and Technology has explicitly called for the production of Chinese chips that challenge Nvidia’s. Because it’s a new market — and because there is such hunger for this new kind of processing power — many believe this is one of those rare opportunities when start-ups have a chance against entrenched giants. The first big change will most likely come in the data center, where companies like Graphcore and Cerebras, which has been quiet about its plans, hope to accelerate the creation of new forms of A.I. Among the goals are bots that can carry on conversations and systems that can automatically generate video and virtual reality. Researchers at places like Microsoft and Google, which has built its own chip just for A.I., “train” neural networks by extreme trial and error, testing the algorithms across vast numbers of chips for hours and even days on end. They often sit at their laptops, staring at graphs that show the progress of these algorithms as they learn from data. Chip designers want to streamline this process, packing all that trial and error into a few minutes. Today, Nvidia’s G.P.U.s can efficiently execute all the tiny calculations that go into training neural networks, but shuttling data between these chips is still inefficient, said Scott Gray, who was an engineer at Nervana before joining OpenAI, an artificial intelligence lab whose founder include Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk. So in addition to building chips specifically for neural networks, start-ups are rethinking the hardware that surrounds them. Graphcore, for example, is building chips that include more built-in memory so that they don’t need to send as much data back and forth. Others are looking at ways of widening the pipes between chips so that data exchange happens faster. “This is not just about building chips but looking at how these chips are connected together and how they talk to the rest of the system,” Mr. Coughran, of Sequoia, said. But this is only part of the change. Once neural networks are trained for a task, additional gear has to execute that task. At Toyota, autonomous car prototypes are using neural networks as a way of identifying pedestrians, signs and other objects on the road. After training a neural network in the data center, the company runs this algorithm on chips installed on the car. A number of chip makers — including start-ups like Mythic, DeePhi and Horizon Robotics — are tackling this problem as well, pushing A.I. chips into devices ranging from phones to cars. It is still unclear how well any of these new chips will work. Designing and building a chip takes about 24 months, which means even the first viable hardware relying on them won’t arrive until this year. And the chip start-ups will face competition from Nvidia, Intel, Google and other industry giants. But everyone is starting from about the same place: the beginning of a new market.\1.0076473951339722,0.5951902866363525,-0.24602912366390228,-0.32624322175979614,-2.153775930404663,-0.08069177716970444,1.5899138450622559,-1.4161722660064697,-1.0188169479370117,-2.2910349369049072,0.3163881301879883,-0.8219156265258789,-1.0767663717269897,-0.5550570487976074,-1.972837209701538,-0.5071398615837097,-1.185207724571228,1.4434435367584229,-1.0670591592788696,-0.11089833080768585,-0.6711056232452393,-0.5109506845474243,-0.3500054180622101,-4.038620948791504,0.4528737962245941,1.156415581703186,0.8750171661376953,0.3880998492240906,0.6482248306274414,-0.08078978955745697,-0.9719271659851074,0.5885648131370544,0.5104578733444214,-0.38870173692703247,-1.4408750534057617,1.347909688949585,-1.30787992477417,-1.1087884902954102,1.4754334688186646,0.22606158256530762,-0.365824818611145,-1.041260004043579,2.2991909980773926,0.09811163693666458,-0.3020782470703125,0.051876988261938095,0.01260167546570301,0.5003136992454529,-1.6018160581588745,-0.3474002778530121,1.0639175176620483,-0.023129215463995934,-2.0962252616882324,-0.20343782007694244,1.9633582830429077,-1.100563645362854,1.3689630031585693,0.5821354389190674,0.3919677436351776,-0.6372148394584656,-0.2556082606315613,-0.35949939489364624,-0.5896097421646118,-1.553511619567871,-1.619802713394165,-0.6034571528434753,0.9710914492607117,3.3347127437591553,-1.0225530862808228,1.0995512008666992,0.1396523118019104,-0.008537097834050655,-0.4681198000907898,0.8342453837394714,0.8940659165382385,0.9588503837585449,-1.3898566961288452,1.2381858825683594,-2.3303656578063965,-1.3515902757644653,-0.3431900441646576,-0.6928461790084839,-1.096733570098877,1.1826012134552002,-0.6940344572067261,0.11499321460723877,1.1058400869369507,-0.2696947455406189,-0.27895835041999817,-1.592202067375183,-1.4408212900161743,0.08690237253904343,0.7255118489265442,2.749804973602295,-0.23249444365501404,0.8170188069343567,-0.3402320444583893,0.746194064617157,-1.9873268604278564,1.688978672027588\NYTIMES\Big Bets on A.I.

1727\Technology\SAN FRANCISCO — One morning in October, the editors of Página Siete, Bolivia’s third-largest news site, noticed that traffic to their outlet coming from Facebook was plummeting. The publication had recently been hit by cyberattacks, and editors feared it was being targeted by hackers loyal to the government of President Evo Morales. But it wasn’t the government’s fault. It was Facebook’s. The Silicon Valley company was testing a new version of its hugely popular News Feed, peeling off professional news sites from what people normally see and relegating them to a new section of Facebook called Explore. Like it or not, Bolivia had become a guinea pig in the company’s continual quest to reinvent itself. As Facebook updates and tweaks its service in order to keep users glued to their screens, countries like Bolivia are ideal testing grounds thanks to their growing, internet-savvy populations. But these changes can have significant consequences, like limiting the audience for nongovernmental news sources and — surprisingly — amplifying the impact of fabricated and sensational stories. On Thursday, Facebook announced plans to make similar changes to its News Feed around the world. The company said it was trying to increase “meaningful interaction” on its site by drawing attention to content from family and friends while de-emphasizing content from brands and publishers, including The New York Times. The changes are being made as the company finds itself embroiled in a larger debate over its role in spreading fake news and misinformation aimed at influencing elections in the United States and other nations. Facebook said these News Feed modifications were not identical to those introduced last fall in six countries through its Explore program, but both alterations favor posts from friends and family over professional news sites. And what happened in those countries illustrates the unintended consequences of such a change in an online service that now has a global reach of more than two billion people every month. In Slovakia, where right-wing nationalists took nearly 10 percent of Parliament in 2016, publishers said the changes had actually helped promote fake news. With official news organizations forced to spend money to place themselves in the News Feed, it is now up to users to share information. “People usually don’t share boring news with boring facts,” said Filip Struharik, the social media editor of Denník N, a Slovakian subscription news site that saw a 30 percent drop in Facebook engagement after the changes. Mr. Struharik, who has been cataloging the effects of Facebook Explore through a monthly tally, has noted a steady rise in engagement on sites that publish fake or sensationalist news. A bogus news story that spread in December illustrates the problem, Mr. Struharik said. The story claimed that a Muslim man had thanked a good Samaritan for returning his lost wallet, and had warned the Samaritan of a terrorist attack that was planned at a Christmas market. The fabricated story circulated so widely that the local police issued a statement saying it wasn’t true. But when the police went to issue the warning on Facebook, they found that the message — unlike the fake news story they meant to combat — could no longer appear on News Feed because it came from an official account. Facebook explained its goals for the Explore program in Slovakia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Bolivia, Guatemala and Serbia in a blog post in October. “The goal of this test is to understand if people prefer to have separate places for personal and public content,” wrote Adam Mosseri, head of Facebook’s News Feed. “There is no current plan to roll this out beyond these test countries.” The company did not respond to a list of questions about the Explore program, but Mr. Mosseri said in a statement on Friday that the company took its role as a “global platform for information” seriously. “We have a responsibility to the people who read, watch and share news on Facebook, and every test is done with that responsibility in mind,” he said. The impact of the changes to the News Feed were also felt in Cambodia. Months into the experiment (Facebook hasn’t said when it will end), Cambodians still don’t know where to find trusted, established news on Facebook, said Stuart White, editor of The Phnom Penh Post, an English-language newspaper. Nongovernmental organizations working on issues like education and health care also complained that the changes broke down lines of communication to Cambodians in need. Facebook has become particularly important in Cambodia. The country’s leader, Hun Sen, has cracked down on political opponents, activists and media, effectively transforming the struggling democracy into a one-party state. Journalists have been arrested, newspapers have been shut down, and Facebook has emerged as an important, more independent channel for information. That is, if you can find that information. Mr. White recalled a conversation this month with a friend who casually observed the lack of political conversation on Facebook. “He said he thought the government had banned politics on Facebook,” Mr. White said. “He had no idea that Facebook had created Explore or was placing news there. He’s a young, urbanite, English-speaking Cambodian. If he didn’t know about it, what do you think the effects are on other parts of the country?” In Bolivia, the alterations to the News Feed also occurred in a country where the government and the press have found themselves at odds, with news sites like Página Siete frequently criticizing Mr. Morales, a left-wing populist who has accumulated enormous power since being elected president in 2006. “We became the only media to take on the government,” said Rodolfo Huallpa, the web editor of Página Siete. Half of the site’s traffic came from social media, with the lion’s share of that from Facebook, he said. Since Explore was introduced, overall web traffic to the site has dropped 20 percent. The loss of visitors from Facebook was readily apparent in October, and Mr. Huallpa could communicate with Facebook only through a customer service form letter. He received an automatic reply in return. After complaints from other outlets, Facebook eventually released a statement on a blog in Spanish explaining the Explore feature and the testing being done in Bolivia and other countries. But Facebook offered no means to contact it, Mr. Huallpa said. “We can’t talk to Zuckerberg, we can’t even talk to a customer service representative,” said Isabel Mercado, the editor of Página Siete, referring to Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. The Explore experiment has reduced traffic by 30 to 60 percent at the website of Los Tiempos, the main newspaper of Cochabamba, the country’s fourth-largest city, said Fabiola Chambi, the publication’s web editor. Ms. Chambi, however, fears the main consequence of the Explore function will be deepening polarization in a country already divided by ideology. “It’s good to see things from your friends and your family, but there needs to be diversity of information,” she said. “The miscellany is good.” Bolivia has also seen an increase in fake news as the established news sites are tucked behind the Explore function. During nationwide judicial elections in December, one post widely shared on Facebook claimed to be from an election official saying votes would be valid only if an X was marked next to the candidate’s name. Another post that day said government officials had put pens with erasable ink in the voting booths. Vladimir Tirado, a social media expert in Bolivia, said the government might simply begin paying for posts to appear on users’ News Feeds, an option that he said most newsrooms could not afford. “Whoever has more money will appear more,” Mr. Tirado said. “In this sense, the government will certainly win.” Ms. Chambi of Los Tiempos said her newsroom hardly had enough money to pay its journalists to report stories, let alone to distribute them as paid posts on Facebook. The situation has left her uneasy about the role that the tech giant may play in her country. “It’s a private company — they have the right to do as they please, of course,” she said. “But the first question we asked is ‘Why Bolivia?’ And we don’t even have the possibility of asking why. Why us?”\0.8239374756813049,-0.25092813372612,-0.162164106965065,0.6500697135925293,-0.0518936850130558,0.5944904685020447,2.9197027683258057,0.021424410864710808,-0.5659930109977722,0.3483697474002838,0.7636553049087524,-0.6702479124069214,-0.9919648766517639,1.3181489706039429,-1.0050947666168213,-0.097996786236763,0.9154126048088074,0.45700499415397644,-0.02922084555029869,-0.7363552451133728,-0.3995210826396942,-0.7881287336349487,0.0076172370463609695,-0.09254276007413864,-0.6179750561714172,0.19002199172973633,1.0225746631622314,0.2493382841348648,-0.08209466189146042,0.9705555438995361,0.14019154012203217,1.2763383388519287,0.691048264503479,0.12548001110553741,0.37052685022354126,-0.2728636562824249,-0.035068899393081665,0.8527269959449768,0.011636764742434025,-0.7034697532653809,-0.9912065863609314,-0.535647988319397,1.300188422203064,-1.0607974529266357,-0.8996484279632568,0.6034582257270813,0.9408004283905029,0.5409353971481323,-1.5827656984329224,0.38448968529701233,1.2530765533447266,-0.4729466140270233,-1.0774580240249634,-0.356294721364975,1.3947628736495972,-1.6682698726654053,1.0872666835784912,-0.47675567865371704,-1.0539326667785645,1.4203864336013794,0.08878374099731445,0.7436922192573547,1.6125792264938354,0.8623326420783997,-1.1241037845611572,0.4824104309082031,-0.47722315788269043,0.5760964155197144,0.08840593695640564,2.4624719619750977,0.17414289712905884,0.5636016130447388,-0.9102891087532043,0.4669233560562134,-1.6815760135650635,-0.7099972367286682,0.14591453969478607,0.3526223599910736,-0.44669806957244873,-1.4120279550552368,0.8739727139472961,0.9189420342445374,-1.1374993324279785,1.51146399974823,0.181414395570755,-0.013497439213097095,0.31611064076423645,0.7741063237190247,1.0152820348739624,-0.159362331032753,-0.30702775716781616,0.9808253049850464,-0.6975803971290588,-0.17533034086227417,-0.6530876159667969,0.14054878056049347,1.0878866910934448,-0.6523600220680237,-1.5081125497817993,1.0463309288024902\NYTIMES\In Some Countries, Facebook’s Fiddling Has Magnified Fake News\2018-01-14 09:00:25.0\
1728\Technology\SAN FRANCISCO — Recently the founder of something called Ripple briefly became richer than Mark Zuckerberg. Another day an anonymous donor set up an $86 million Bitcoin-fortune charity called the Pineapple Fund. A Tesla was spotted with a BLOCKHN license plate. There’s a surge in people looking to buy Bitcoin on their credit cards. After the Long Island Iced Tea company announced it would pivot to blockchain, its stock rose 500 percent in a day. In 2017, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin went from $830 to $19,300, and now quivers around $14,000. Ether, its main rival, started the year at less than $10, closing out 2017 at $715. Now it’s over $1,100. The wealth is intoxicating news, feverish because it seems so random. Investors trying to grok the landscape compare it to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, when valuations soared and it was hard to separate the Amazons and Googles from the Pets.coms and eToys. The cryptocurrency community is centered around a tightknit group of friends — developers, libertarians, Redditors and cypherpunks — who have known each other for years through meet-ups, an endless circuit of crypto conferences and internet message boards. Over long hours in anonymous group chats, San Francisco bars and Settlers of Catan game nights, they talk about how cryptocurrency will decentralize power and wealth, changing the world order. The goal may be decentralization, but the money is extremely concentrated. Coinbase has more than 13 million accounts that own cryptocurrencies. Data suggests that about 94 percent of the Bitcoin wealth is held by men, and some estimate that 95 percent of the wealth is held by 4 percent of the owners. There are only a few winners here, and, unless they lose it all, their impact going forward will be outsize. They also remember who laughed at them and when. James Spediacci and his twin brother, Julian, who bought ether when it was about 30 cents, now run one of the most popular whale clubs: private cryptocurrency trading communities where crypto syndicates are coordinated in group chats. He showed me a screen shot of his Facebook post from 2014 telling everyone to buy ether. “One like,” he said, pointing to his phone. “It got one like.” Whether it’s all built on sand or not, the crypto castle has risen. There’s an actual house called the Crypto Castle, and the king is Jeremy Gardner, 25, a rakish young investor with a hedge fund who has become the de facto tour guide for crypto newcomers. Early one afternoon, he opened a bottle of rosé while he charged half a dozen external batteries so he wouldn’t have to ever plug in his phone in Ibiza, Spain, the next week. “I do I.C.O.s. It’s my thing,” he said. He wore a pink button-front and pink pants. “It’s me, a couple V.C.s and a lot of charlatans.” An initial coin offering is a way to raise money: A company creates its own cryptocurrency and investors buy into the new coin, without actually buying a stake in the company. Mr. Gardner led an I.C.O. for his start-up Augur, creating an “Augur token” that he then sold to raise real world money. These tokens sold fast, and it is one of the forces that kicked off this boom. For a time, the value of Augur, a market-forecasting start-up with few customers, exceeded $1 billion. About eight people live in the Crypto Castle on any given night, and some of Mr. Gardner’s tenants brought out snacks (Cheez-Its and a jar of Nutella). One of the bedrooms has a stripper pole. Mr. Gardner leaned back into the sofa and rested his feet on the table. He recently did an I.C.O. for a start-up after-party. “You can I.C.O. anything,” he said. He runs Distributed, a 180-page magazine about cryptocurrency that comes out about once a year. He is now raising $75 million for his hedge fund, Ausum Ventures (pronounced “awesome”). He said his closest friends are moving to Puerto Rico to get around paying taxes. “They’re going to build a modern-day Atlantis out there,” he said. “But for me, it’s too early in my career to check out.” He wears a bracelet from his Burning Man camp (Mayan Warrior) and a necklace that is a key on a chain. “I was given this necklace and was told my net worth would go up, and it’s gone up six x since then,” he said. He drew a chart to explain the crypto community: 20 percent for ideology, 60 percent for the tech and 100 percent for the money, he said, drawing a circle around it all. A roommate on the sofa perked up and asked if he’d ever invest in his lucid dreams start-up (the idea is a headpiece that induces them). Mr. Gardner did not seem impressed: “Probably not,” he said. A reality show wants to follow him around, but he’s skeptical that it can add to his life. “I literally have a date with Bella Hadid not having a reality show,” he said. A few weeks after we first met, as the Bitcoin price exploded in December, Mr. Gardner seemed shaken. People had begun making pilgrimages to the Crypto Castle, knocking on the door, hoping Mr. Gardner could help them invest. “Nothing feels real, it doesn’t feel real,” he said. “I’m ready for crypto assets to go down 90 percent. I’ll feel better then, I think. This has been too insane.” Nearby is a building residents call the Crypto Crackhouse. Grant Hummer, who runs the San Francisco Ethereum Meetup, lives there. Long hallways called Bitcoin Boulevard and Ethereum Alley lead to communal bathrooms. Mr. Hummer and his co-founder committed $40 million of their own crypto-made money to their new $100 million hedge fund, Chromatic Capital. “My neurons are fried from all the volatility,” Mr. Hummer said. “I don’t even care at this point. I’m numb to it. I’ll lose a million dollars in a day and I’m like, O.K.” His room is simple: a bed, a futon, a TV on a mostly empty media console, three keyboard cleaning sprays and a half dozen canisters of Lysol wipes. His T-shirt read, ‘The Lizard of Wall Street,’ with a picture of a lizard in a suit, dollar-sign necklaces around its neck. He carries with him a coin that reads, “memento mori,” to remind himself he can die any day. He sees the boom as part of a global apocalypse. “The worse regular civilization does and the less you trust, the better crypto does,” Mr. Hummer said. "It’s almost like the ultimate short trade.” Mr. Hummer went out to meet Joe Buttram, 27, for drinks. As a mixed martial arts fighter, Mr. Buttram said he would fight for a couple hundred bucks, sometimes a few thousand, and worked security at a start-up, but his main hobbies were reading 4chan and buying vintage pornography, passions that exposed him to cryptocurrency. He said his holdings are into double-digit millions but wouldn’t give specifics other than to say he’d quit his job and is starting a hedge fund. There’s a common paranoia among the crypto-wealthy that they’ll be targeted and robbed since there’s no bank securing the money, so many are obsessively secretive. Many say even their parents don’t know how much they’ve made. This also allows people to pretend to be wealthier than they are, of course. “It’s unforgiving,” Mr. Buttram said. “You make one mistake and it’s all gone.” They talk about buying Lamborghinis, the single acceptable way to spend money in the Ethereum cryptocurrency community. The currency’s founder frequently appears in fan art as Jesus with a Lamborghini. Mr. Buttram says he’s renting an orange Lambo for the weekend. And he wears a solid gold Bitcoin “B” necklace encrusted with diamonds that he had made. Otherwise, HODL. This is one of the core beliefs in this community: HODL, “hold” typed very fast, as if in a panic. HODL even if you feel FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt. If you show wealth, it means you don’t really believe in the cryptocurrency revolution, a full remake of the financial system, governments and our world order that will send the price of ether up astronomically. “HODL when everyone has FUD,” Mr. Hummer said quietly, to explain why he still lives in a dorm room. “This will change civilization. This can 100 x or more from here.” He knows this is strange. “When I meet people in the normal world now, I get bored,” Mr. Hummer said. “It’s just a different level of consciousness.” The tone turns somber. “Sometimes I think about what would happen to the future if a bomb went off at one of our meetings,” Mr. Buttram said. Mr. Hummer said, “A bomb would set back civilization for years.” A few days later, Mr. Hummer was working from his co-founder’s apartment. James Fickel, 26, lives in a high-rise with a Russian blue cat called Mr. Bigglesworth. Mr. Fickel is known in the community for “going full YOLO” and investing $400,000 when Ethereum was at 80 cents. Now, with a fortune he says is in the hundreds of millions, his parents have retired and sent his younger sister to live with him. “I’m taking over her education,” Mr. Fickel said, sitting on a white leather sofa, Mr. Bigglesworth asleep in his impossibly skinny arms. Today, Mr. Fickel is outlining the endgame for cryptocurrency true believers. “It’s the entire world reorganizing itself,” Mr. Fickel said. “We could get rid of our armies because for the first time you’ll have people saying, ‘I want to vote for a global order.’ It’s the internet waking up — it’s the internet grabbing its pitchfork. That’s the blockchain.” Mr. Hummer is skeptical. “All I know is the price of ether is going to go up,” Mr. Hummer said. At a jazz bar a few days later, I run into Mr. Fickel’s personal trainer, Alan Chen, who is now running in this crypto circle. Mr. Fickel had convinced Mr. Chen to put his savings into Ethereum. “I’m retired, man,” Mr. Chen said. “I’m moving to L.A. next week. I got a penthouse on Marina del Rey.” “Don’t say I’m retired,” he added. “I’m going into business now. I’m going to use blockchain to help personal trainers.” Nearby was Chante Eliaszadeh, 22, a law student at the University of California, Berkeley, who started the Berkeley Law Blockchain group. “Obviously the bubble’s going to burst and everyone’s going to need a lawyer,” she said. At the annual San Francisco Bitcoin Meetup Party, hundreds gathered under the fluorescent lights of a co-working space, and there was a line out the door. The waiting list had to be told not to show up. Many there wore Bitcoin- and Ethereum-themed clothes from Hodlmoon, which sells unisex cryptocurrency sweaters. Those closest to the technology are the most cautious. Pieter Wuille, 33, a Bitcoin core developer, kept his backpack on as he wandered the party. He’s part of the team working to develop the Bitcoin technology. “The technology still needs time to evolve,” Mr. Wuille said. "This infusion of interest is bringing the wrong kind of attention. Some people believe Bitcoin can’t fail or this technology solves many more problems than it does. It can. And it does not.” He said everyone is asking him whether to buy Bitcoin. “I tell them I have no idea,” he said. “I don’t know!” “There’s so many people rushing into the space, if it’s a bit of speculation, I’m O.K. with that,” said the Coinbase C.E.O., Brian Armstrong, whose company has become the de facto portal for casual investors. “But we can’t guarantee the website’s going to be up exactly when you need it. Everyone needs to take a deep breath.” As the holiday party filled up, a cryptocurrency rapper called CoinDaddy — Arya Bahmanyar, 28 — was getting ready to perform. Formerly a commercial real estate agent, Mr. Bahmanyar works full time at CoinDaddy after becoming a self-described crypto-millionaire (“you think I would dress up like this if I wasn’t?”). “Right now all our entertainers come from outside crypto culture — not inside crypto, and we’ve got to change that,” he said. He pointed to his outfit — a long white fake mink coat, gold-heeled shoes — and said, “It’s gold, right? It’s gold. It’s a niche, and I’m going to fill it.” He says he is going to shoot a music video soon for a song called “Lambo Party” and another called “Cryptomom,” about “all these moms are pumping in their children’s savings accounts.” Maria Lomeli, 56, came to the party to find the people she had put a lot of trust in. A housekeeper from Pacifica, Calif., she said she had invested $12,000 in cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks after reading about it in the news. She wore running shoes and a zip-up jacket that said, “Cinemark, the best seats in town.” She worked there cleaning out theaters. Now she cleans houses. Banks, she said, were designed to steal. Taxes left her supporting a government that she felt didn’t support her. “Charges for sending money to my daughter, interest on our loans,” she said. "And then the money we pay in taxes goes to wars and whatever else they want.” She found a Bitcoin event in the city and asked people there how to buy Bitcoin on her phone. She invested $1,000. It went up. So she put in $10,000 more, she said, along with $1,000 in a currency called Litecoin. Both her children have discouraged this. “And maybe I’m going to lose it,” she said. “Maybe I’m going to keep cleaning houses. But something is telling me I can trust this generation. My instinct is telling me this is the future.” She had to leave the party early because parking downtown is expensive, she said. She zipped up her jacket and left on her own.\3.021084785461426,-0.25404685735702515,-0.84287029504776,0.47028234601020813,-1.0869693756103516,0.11705002188682556,0.33814144134521484,-0.658755898475647,-2.1733791828155518,-0.800714910030365,1.0979676246643066,-0.2736644744873047,-0.6912937760353088,-0.3961845338344574,0.020932354032993317,-1.6909852027893066,0.19373522698879242,0.6191315650939941,-1.4637573957443237,-0.48247426748275757,1.6900877952575684,-1.859659194946289,-0.5831209421157837,-0.23998868465423584,-1.3696660995483398,2.3969995975494385,2.3313348293304443,0.8915088176727295,-0.270004540681839,0.0953531265258789,1.4240989685058594,0.2094811648130417,0.9463160037994385,0.74419105052948,-0.40708813071250916,0.1212170198559761,0.47767049074172974,-0.5588792562484741,1.6282987594604492,-0.5336146950721741,-0.06206599995493889,-0.5188714265823364,1.6288810968399048,-0.5233347415924072,-0.16866910457611084,-0.539261519908905,1.6614924669265747,1.4848562479019165,-0.7386428117752075,0.1280711442232132,2.1146509647369385,-1.3299884796142578,-1.9731992483139038,1.3252933025360107,2.4962263107299805,-0.13823826611042023,1.5604991912841797,0.35639676451683044,-0.8805314898490906,1.7279759645462036,-0.14869113266468048,-0.2325623482465744,0.332899272441864,-1.0613089799880981,-0.8035923838615417,0.8519280552864075,0.6087077856063843,1.673852562904358,-0.5624615550041199,1.8690752983093262,-0.2607625424861908,0.7399792671203613,-0.7930523753166199,0.6040322780609131,-2.1487338542938232,1.9575368165969849,-1.6741570234298706,0.09390132129192352,-0.8911365866661072,-2.9495038986206055,-1.4291245937347412,-1.1473532915115356,-1.7462849617004395,1.2421650886535645,-0.2866608500480652,-1.4439960718154907,0.7064367532730103,1.3045194149017334,-0.36915773153305054,-0.16344548761844635,0.14260008931159973,0.39186570048332214,-1.043672800064087,1.005431890487671,0.28239724040031433,-0.1322505921125412,-1.7296881675720215,-0.17871937155723572,-1.78691828250885,0.4653749167919159\NYTIMES\Everyone Is Getting Hilariously Rich and You’re Not\2018-01-14 07:35:33.0\
1729\Technology\SAN FRANCISCO — “Hello Joe,” read the November 2016 email from someone identifying himself as “John Doughs.” “I have found a major vulnerability in Uber.” The email appeared to be no different from other messages that Joe Sullivan, Uber’s chief security officer, and his team routinely received through the company’s “bug bounty” program, which pays hackers for reporting holes in the ride-hailing service’s systems, according to current and former Uber security employees. Yet the note and Uber’s eventual $100,000 payment to the hacker, which was initially celebrated internally as a rare win in corporate security, have since turned into a public relations debacle for the company. In November, when Uber disclosed the 2016 incident and how the information of 57 million driver and rider accounts had been at risk, the company’s chief executive since August, Dara Khosrowshahi, called it a “failure” that it had not notified people earlier. Mr. Sullivan and a security lawyer, Craig Clark, were fired. In the weeks since, Uber’s handling of the hacking has come under major scrutiny. Not only did Uber pay an outsize amount to the hacker, but it also did not disclose that it had briefly lost control of so much consumer and driver data until a year later. The behavior raised questions of a cover-up and a lack of transparency, as well as whether the payment really was just a ransom paid by a security operation that had acted on its own for too long. The hacking is now the subject of at least four lawsuits, with attorneys general in five states investigating whether Uber broke laws on data-breach notifications. In addition, the United States attorney for Northern California has begun a criminal investigation into the matter. Most of all, the hacking and Uber’s response have fueled a debate about whether companies that have crusaded to lock up their systems can scrupulously work with hackers without putting themselves on the wrong side of the law. Uber is illustrative of a breed of company that aimed to bulletproof its security. While many corporations were for years blissfully unaware of hackers penetrating their systems, Uber and others recruited former law enforcement and intelligence analysts and installed layers of technical defenses and password security. They joined other companies in embracing the same hackers they once treated as criminals, shelling out bug bounties as high as $200,000 to report flaws. Yet since the fallout from Uber’s disclosure, Silicon Valley companies have taken a harder look at their bounty programs. At least three have put their programs under review, according to two consultants who have confidential relationships with those companies, which they declined to name. Others said criminal prosecutions for not reporting John Doughs would deter ethical hackers who would otherwise come forward, causing even more security breaches. “Anything that causes organizations to take a step backwards and not welcome contributions from the security community will have a negative impact on all of us,” said Alex Rice, a co-founder of HackerOne, a security company whose business is to work with customers, including Uber, to manage interactions with and payments to hackers. The situation is complicated by Uber’s track record for pushing boundaries, which put it under scrutiny last year and helped spur the resignation of Travis Kalanick, its longtime chief executive, in June. Mr. Khosrowshahi has since vowed to change the way the company conducts itself. This account of Uber’s hacking and the company’s response was based on more than a dozen interviews with people who dealt with the incident, many of whom declined to be identified because of the confidentiality of their exchanges. Many are current or former members of Uber’s security team, who defended their actions as a prime example of how executives should respond to security problems. The New York Times also obtained more than two dozen internal Uber emails and documents related to the incident. In a statement, Mr. Sullivan disputed the notion that the 2016 episode was a breach and said Uber had treated it as an authorized vulnerability disclosure. “I was surprised and disappointed when those who wanted to portray Uber in a negative light quickly suggested this was a cover-up,” he said, adding that he was proud its engineers had been able to fix the issue before it could be abused. He declined to discuss disclosure because of the active state investigations. Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman, said, “We stand by our decision to very publicly disclose the 2016 data breach — not because it was easy, but because it was the right thing to do.” Through a spokesman, Mr. Kalanick declined to comment. Uber started its bounty program in March 2016, challenging hackers to find bugs that could specifically lead to the exposure of sensitive user data. The higher risk the bug was, the more Uber would pay. In Uber’s calculus, the payouts were better than learning about a vulnerability only after attackers had abused it. By the time Mr. Sullivan got John Doughs email, Uber had paid rewards to hundreds of hackers. Mr. Sullivan forwarded the John Doughs note to his team for vetting and, if all checked out, patching and payment. Uber’s security team used nicknames for hackers, particularly the colorful, anonymous ones who engaged with the company. John Doughs was called “Preacher” for his admonitions that Uber should be better at security. “It’s very disappointing to be finding this vulnerability in such way,” the hacker wrote in an email to Rob Fletcher, Uber’s product security engineering manager. “Especially coming from a company like Uber.” Other emails obtained by The Times show Mr. Fletcher treated the incident as a bounty and encouraged Preacher to provide proof of the vulnerability, including sending a few lines of data from the database he had breached. According to the emails obtained by The Times, Uber soon discovered that some of its employees had left certain computer code known as keys on a programming site called Github. Those keys had allowed Preacher to gain access to Uber’s Amazon web servers, where it stored source code as well as 57 million customer and driver accounts, including driver’s license numbers for some 600,000 Uber drivers. It was a major oversight. To fix it, Uber had to inform everyone at the company that it was temporarily shutting down access to Github. Emails between the hacker and Mr. Fletcher continued. In some, Mr. Fletcher thanked the hacker for helping the company fix the oversight. In two emails, Preacher’s motivations appeared to veer closer toward blackmail. In one, he demanded “high compensation” for his findings. After Mr. Fletcher said the company’s maximum bounty was $10,000, Preacher said he and his team would only accept “six digits.” Mr. Fletcher said he would need to seek authorization for a $100,000 payment, and would need Preacher’s reassurances that he would delete the data he had downloaded. Mr. Fletcher also pushed the hacker to take payment through HackerOne, which requires bounty recipients to disclose their real identities for tax requirements. Mr. Fletcher drew further details about the hacker out through emails, including tidbits about his identity, his internet hosting provider, the location of his computer and proof that he deleted his copy of Uber’s downloaded data by looking at a virtual copy of his system provided by his host. According to the emails, Uber at one point extended Preacher an all-expenses paid trip to San Francisco, where the company is based. Uber asked the hacker to discuss his security techniques and offered to introduce him to companies that might be interested in his skills. Preacher declined. By then, Uber’s executives had decided what to do. Mr. Kalanick signed off on the $100,000 payment, so long as the hacker signed an agreement to destroy any data exposed in his discovery, according to the emails. Preacher’s trail of digital bread crumbs eventually led to a 20-year-old whose first name was Brandon and who was living in a Florida trailer park with his family, according to the emails. In one email, Uber offered to send someone to meet Brandon at a local coffee shop. Brandon declined to leave his home and suggested that the employee meet him there. It was there that Brandon signed agreements assuring Uber that he had deleted the data he had downloaded. The Times was unable to learn Brandon’s full name. An email to the John Doughs account bounced back. Uber’s security team was soon celebrating its response to what could have been a major security breach. Mr. Sullivan and his colleagues were praised in year-end performance reviews, including by Mr. Kalanick, according to current and former employees. What is now at issue is whether Uber executives broke the law with the $100,000 payment and should have quickly notified customers or officials of the discovery. The issue is not legally clear cut. Laws concerning bug bounties are ambiguous. The Justice Department weighed into bug disclosure programs for the first time in July and largely left it to organizations to decide what access they will authorize for hackers and what they can do with the data. In Uber’s case, its bounty guidelines authorized and encouraged hackers to look for vulnerabilities that exposed its most sensitive user data. Breach disclosure laws also differ state to state. The state laws most relevant to Uber’s case require disclosure if names are exposed in combination with driver’s license numbers in a “breach of security.” Brandon received two payments of $50,000 each from Uber on Dec. 8, 2016, according to the emails. Uber continued trading emails with Brandon during 2017, until the conversation dwindled. Last fall, when two outside law firms for Uber learned about the payment to the hacker, they advised the company that the incident should have been disclosed, according to an Uber employee familiar with the matter. Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Clark, the lawyer who directly oversaw the bounty payment, were fired for not seeking outside counsel on the issue of whether to disclose, this person said. That prompted a call to Mr. Sullivan while he was preparing Thanksgiving dinner, according to two people familiar with the matter. He was fired, effective immediately.\0.6449316740036011,0.20093964040279388,-1.750540852546692,-0.9977828860282898,-0.5507776737213135,-0.6516903042793274,-0.14826196432113647,1.4310258626937866,-2.6100003719329834,-0.25193193554878235,-0.18742695450782776,0.7964501976966858,-0.8781254887580872,-0.587131679058075,0.3427125811576843,0.708943784236908,-0.8966666460037231,1.0409609079360962,0.3899674117565155,-0.2760576009750366,2.2373721599578857,-0.888054609298706,0.052362605929374695,0.2335805594921112,-1.055742859840393,1.562086582183838,2.2620036602020264,0.9582206010818481,-0.6662344932556152,-0.614271879196167,0.8617098331451416,1.2798134088516235,1.0051989555358887,0.7272889614105225,-0.7512568235397339,-0.4589984118938446,0.8433130979537964,-0.42121103405952454,1.058963656425476,-1.5181524753570557,0.38393545150756836,0.1725633591413498,0.9438270926475525,-1.5058374404907227,-0.07231897860765457,-2.0983731746673584,0.30555930733680725,-0.653315007686615,-1.1566603183746338,-0.04133680462837219,0.3616059124469757,-0.969951868057251,-0.12675386667251587,-1.7891594171524048,0.40225085616111755,-0.7467629313468933,0.5758166909217834,-0.9898757338523865,-0.6481578946113586,1.7624694108963013,-2.580049753189087,-0.13156163692474365,-0.03954668715596199,0.12454323470592499,0.5835307240486145,-0.5656712055206299,0.035909414291381836,2.802894115447998,-1.656693935394287,1.4079533815383911,1.8157567977905273,0.05645104497671127,0.5961754322052002,1.870073676109314,-0.6637970209121704,-0.29240667819976807,-0.3755350112915039,0.4697233736515045,-0.6797927618026733,-0.9043172597885132,1.5824663639068604,-0.02120675891637802,-1.5194119215011597,1.2137943506240845,1.7860441207885742,1.4561418294906616,0.3011893332004547,0.9210759997367859,-0.332181841135025,-1.5967265367507935,-0.6465065479278564,1.670698881149292,-2.677187442779541,0.8140754103660583,-1.386152744293213,0.53310227394104,0.27822011709213257,-2.085850954055786,-1.3185511827468872,-0.9229342341423035\NYTIMES\Inside Uber’s $100,000 Payment to a Hacker, and the Fallout\2018-01-13 03:22:24.0\
1730\Technology\Two years ago, Songkick, a ticketing start-up that operated out of a loft in Brooklyn, filed an antitrust suit against Live Nation Entertainment, the colossus of the concert business. The David-and-Goliath suit included accusations of abuse of market power by Live Nation and its Ticketmaster subsidiary. But on Friday, less than two weeks before the start of a trial, Live Nation announced that it had settled the suit for $110 million and an additional undisclosed sum to acquire some of Songkick’s remaining technology assets and patents. “We are pleased that we were able to resolve this dispute and avoid protracted and costly legal proceedings, while also acquiring valuable assets,” Joe Berchtold, the president of Live Nation, said in a joint statement. Matt Jones, the chief executive of Songkick’s parent company, Complete Entertainment Resources Group, thanked employees and artists “who contributed so much to our many successes over the last decade.” Last summer, Songkick sold one of its main businesses, a concert-recommendation app, to the Warner Music Group — owned by one of Songkick’s major investors, Access Industries — and later shut down its remaining operations. Songkick’s case hinged on the rights to sell a ticket. The company specialized in so-called artist presales, or selling batches of advance tickets — often around 8 percent of the inventory for a show — to fans. Presales serve, in part, as a way to thwart scalpers. Songkick contended that Live Nation was interfering in its business by blocking its access to presale tickets and by demanding fees on the sale of tickets that Songkick handled. But Live Nation, which countersued, argued that its contracts with venues gave it the right to determine how those tickets should be sold. Songkick’s suit also accused Live Nation of threatening artists not to do business with Songkick. The case was also punctuated by accusations of corporate espionage by Ticketmaster, and had voluminous court filings showing sometimes embarrassing internal communications among top Live Nation executives. Many in the music industry were skeptical about Songkick’s case, and the company lost a number of pretrial motions. But until recently the company was insistent on pursuing its case.\0.574982762336731,0.4847343862056732,0.019112659618258476,-0.3611891269683838,0.3389096260070801,0.46895521879196167,-0.3009556233882904,0.3396839201450348,-1.1593319177627563,-0.6905862092971802,-0.7326062917709351,0.5479580760002136,-0.5147021412849426,0.10274384915828705,-0.09197744727134705,0.290181428194046,-0.7415362596511841,-0.14499889314174652,0.6186186671257019,0.08245820552110672,0.27283284068107605,0.09550202637910843,0.10106082260608673,-0.16066710650920868,-0.16650080680847168,-0.4131353497505188,0.8220518827438354,-0.3382386565208435,0.49347254633903503,0.03387639299035072,0.07394633442163467,0.374513179063797,0.29186320304870605,-0.021213946864008904,0.4697887599468231,-0.4480210542678833,0.3754434883594513,-0.026998331770300865,0.033561404794454575,-0.009430252946913242,-0.2358870804309845,0.16282875835895538,0.37033146619796753,-0.016350774094462395,-0.2038821280002594,-0.5378580689430237,-0.1831527203321457,-1.3232063055038452,-1.3829799890518188,0.3280754089355469,-0.31611764430999756,0.7587730884552002,-0.28748461604118347,0.44901585578918457,1.491407036781311,-0.3059740662574768,-0.07221661508083344,-0.3304539918899536,-1.0766295194625854,-0.4620892405509949,0.1015457808971405,-0.08769865334033966,0.20440883934497833,-0.31917330622673035,-0.7750149965286255,-0.4051113724708557,0.8400952219963074,1.4081296920776367,-1.0847073793411255,0.35066139698028564,0.27952516078948975,-0.318767249584198,0.026175230741500854,0.21633869409561157,0.8222156167030334,0.7034510970115662,-0.44617486000061035,-0.5256884098052979,-1.8166561126708984,-0.4612557291984558,0.48422670364379883,-0.10569416731595993,-0.2464221715927124,1.0574705600738525,0.25129255652427673,0.5666837692260742,-0.2636926472187042,0.5377143025398254,0.04566003754734993,-0.16244202852249146,0.4680543541908264,0.456592857837677,-0.5117961764335632,-0.15334728360176086,0.07066093385219574,-0.2735755443572998,0.04319589212536812,-0.6440500617027283,-0.5248764157295227,0.722172200679779\NYTIMES\Live Nation Settles Suit With Ticketing Start-Up, Buying Its Assets\2018-01-13 06:20:26.0\
1731\Technology\Peter Thiel, the technology billionaire, submitted a bid this week to purchase Gawker.com, the remaining unsold property from the Gawker Media gossip empire that was nearly destroyed in 2016 by a lawsuit largely bankrolled by Mr. Thiel. If approved, the acquisition could be the last step in a yearslong effort by Mr. Thiel to finish an independent journalism outfit that angered him in 2007 when it reported, without his permission, that he is gay, a fact widely known at the time in Silicon Valley. Gawker.com has received other offers, and it is not clear if Mr. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, will prevail. A winning bid is expected to be announced in the coming weeks, if representatives of Gawker.com do not take the site off the market. “There are going to be multiple factors to consider, which will not be solely economic,” said Will Holden, the administrator of Gawker’s bankruptcy plan. Mr. Thiel, who has an estimated net worth of $2.5 billion, according to Forbes, has the means to beat almost any rival bidder. But Mr. Holden said the “ethos” of Gawker — which prided itself on a wry, pirate-ship approach to reporting — would also be considered in determining new ownership of the Gawker name. Gawker Media went bankrupt in 2016 after a $140 million legal judgment against it in an invasion-of-privacy case brought by the former wrestler Hulk Hogan. Gawker.com had published a black-and-white sex tape of Mr. Hogan, whose real name is Terry G. Bollea; a Florida jury awarded damages to the wrestler after a two-week trial. It also emerged that Mr. Thiel had spent about $10 million in secretly backing the lawsuit, a move that many Gawker employees interpreted as an attempt at revenge. Mr. Thiel told The New York Times: “It’s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence. I saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest.” Univision bought Gawker Media at auction in August 2016 for $135 million. The company changed the name of its new asset to Gizmodo Media Group, after the group’s Gizmodo tech blog, and jettisoned the Gawker.com flagship site, which remains online, albeit in a static form, a digital orphan. Raju Narisetti, formerly an executive at News Corporation, took the place of the Gawker Media founder, Nick Denton, as the chief executive officer. Mr. Thiel’s interest in buying Gawker.com has led to speculation that he might delete the site’s archives, effectively erasing its journalism from the web. A spokesman for the billionaire did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment. Mr. Holden declined to comment on the dollar amount of Mr. Thiel’s offer. Kevin Lee, the head of a marketing firm, Didit, also submitted a bid for Gawker.com, according to Reuters, which first reported Mr. Thiel’s offer.\-0.0011995434761047363,-0.42729485034942627,-0.008302319794893265,0.11755134165287018,0.6134580373764038,0.08486899733543396,-0.1916322410106659,0.3290110230445862,-0.7206526398658752,-0.4401807188987732,-0.14428718388080597,0.31009307503700256,-0.40210264921188354,1.5757701396942139,-0.3896167576313019,0.2772596478462219,-0.3773331344127655,0.1731751561164856,1.3883129358291626,-0.7575585842132568,-0.08267046511173248,-0.28909698128700256,-1.0536887645721436,0.2850201427936554,-1.1308480501174927,-0.036625709384679794,0.4651961624622345,0.6589863300323486,0.8705458045005798,-0.7509920001029968,0.3070460855960846,1.003489375114441,0.09277225285768509,0.007417121436446905,0.16349706053733826,-0.4347241222858429,-0.1554080992937088,0.484811395406723,-0.6672705411911011,-0.023241283372044563,-0.6859831213951111,-0.20056064426898956,0.9317716956138611,0.35613778233528137,0.11617399007081985,-0.5415458083152771,-0.24102868139743805,-0.39490965008735657,-0.8646100759506226,-0.2788987457752228,0.41402238607406616,0.22205868363380432,-0.3172498941421509,0.7154223322868347,1.6759686470031738,-0.3906880021095276,0.5233763456344604,0.026067914441227913,-1.9130520820617676,0.6273931860923767,-0.453332781791687,0.22942671179771423,-0.11750832200050354,0.650155246257782,-0.3688220977783203,0.5111933946609497,0.5840482711791992,1.306902289390564,-1.3528696298599243,1.0718786716461182,0.5501188635826111,0.3981785178184509,-0.563525915145874,-0.33137768507003784,-0.09378521144390106,-0.06768714636564255,-0.4804956912994385,-0.178750678896904,-0.6199414134025574,-0.6660496592521667,0.8235849738121033,0.21732690930366516,0.014821616001427174,0.16365036368370056,-0.25864043831825256,0.44130373001098633,0.23380039632320404,1.2224152088165283,0.5166648626327515,-0.2762402892112732,-0.36847779154777527,1.0895169973373413,-0.4574641287326813,-0.46531298756599426,-0.4925529360771179,-0.18043039739131927,-1.381699800491333,-0.5654861330986023,-1.0809228420257568,-0.06768380850553513\NYTIMES\Thiel Makes a Bid for Gawker.com, a Site He Helped Bankrupt\2018-01-12 23:00:50.0\
1732\Technology\Imagine you’re a cookie mogul. You figured out a way to make lots of money by giving away delicious cookies for free, and in less than a decade, you created a global cookie behemoth. But recently your cookie kingdom has begun to crumble. Scientists are worried that people are eating so many of your cookies that they’re making themselves sick — yet they keep eating more, because who can say no to free cookies? There are concerns that your cookies are crowding out the market for normal food; after your success, fruit and vegetable companies have pivoted to free cookies, and now much of the global food supply is just cookies. Rising cookie addiction might even have helped a foreign government influence your country’s election. So you decide to do something. You convene your best bakers, and you tell them, look, from now on, we don’t just care about how many free cookies we can shove into people’s gullets. We want to take a holistic look at the overall cookie experience. We want people to eat some cookies, sure, but we don’t want them to eat too many, so we will have to make our free cookies less addictive and more “meaningful.” Let’s maybe put carrots and kale and broccoli in the cookies. What sort of cookie company wants people to eat fewer cookies? One named Facebook, apparently. On Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg announced that as part of his effort to turn the social network into a force for good, the company would make a significant change to its News Feed. The feed — the list of status updates the app displays on its primary screen — will prioritize posts that elicit what Facebook calls “meaningful” interactions with friends and family, and will downgrade things like links to articles and videos, which it says encourages you to passively scroll through the News Feed. The effort sounds helpful, even noble, given that Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged the change could be bad for business in the short run. But if you think about Facebook’s primary service as free cookies rather than social networking, the underlying difficulties with the plan become obvious, and even existential. Do people really want a more “meaningful” Facebook any more than they want healthy cookies? Didn’t we get hooked on Facebook for its easy outrages in the first place — for the sugar, not for the broccoli? And if Facebook’s underlying business model is based on how much time we all spend eating there, can the company ever truly resist the pressure to keep plying us with more cookies? These questions don’t mean that Mr. Zuckerberg’s new plan will fail. But if he really does want to make the time we spend on Facebook count as “time well spent,” I suspect Facebook will have to change much more radically than it is now letting on. It can’t just become a slightly healthier cookie company; it may have to get out of the sugar business altogether. And what, then, happens to all those billions in future profits? (On Friday, the stock market seemed to harbor the same worry; Facebook’s stock fell 4.5 percent.) Mr. Zuckerberg says his concerns are raised by research showing that some uses of social networking make people feel bad about themselves. As two of Facebook’s researchers described in a recent blog post, mindlessly reading the News Feed without interacting much — just scrolling and pressing Like occasionally — was associated with lower mental well-being. But a study that Facebook’s scientists conducted with outside researchers found that deeper sharing on the network — “sharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions,” per the blog post — improves a person’s well-being. It’s this sort of activity that Facebook is trying to encourage with the new design. Think of it as the kale cookie of Facebook. Facebook is conceding that when the good kind of social networking is given priority over the bad kind, people are likely to spend less time on the service. What’s unclear is how much less time. According to data collected by Nielsen and crunched by Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, American adults spent about 37 minutes a day on Facebook in September. What if it turns out that if we’re going to spend only worthwhile time on Facebook, we need only 10 or 15 minutes there a day? It’s likely that Facebook has a very good idea of how its changes will affect engagement; the company is obsessive about running experiments and modeling its changes using data, and it probably would not have pushed this change if the numbers were catastrophic. But its modeling is most likely only a guide to the short term. What Facebook can’t predict is how the outside world might react — how users, advertisers, investors and competitors will alter their behavior in the face of a less immediately engaging News Feed. Mr. Zuckerberg is a famously fierce and ruthless competitor. If it looks like Facebook’s business is starting to suffer because of the healthier News Feed, and if some competitor comes along to offer us all the free cookies that Facebook is denying us, I doubt Mr. Zuckerberg will be able to stick to his guns. There is a story that veterans at Facebook like to tell to illustrate the power of the News Feed. When Facebook first unveiled the feed back in 2006, many users hated it. They thought a running list of people’s status updates was a kind of invasion of privacy — before, updates were hidden on people’s walls — and lots of people mobilized against it. People started creating Facebook groups promising to boycott Facebook, and within days those groups quickly grew to hundreds of thousands of members — the biggest groups that had ever formed on Facebook. Which, oddly, backfired. To the News Feed’s creators, the protests only served to prove the News Feed’s utility; it was only thanks to the viral power of the News Feed that people were able to mobilize against News Feed. All these years later, the story also suggests how hard it will be to alter the purpose of the feed. The News Feed’s killer app has always been easy, viral outrage. It’s always been just clicking Like on something you’re kinda, sorta passionate about, then forgetting about it. It’s always been cookies, not broccoli.

1733\Technology\SAN FRANCISCO — I’ve gone gray, and it’s great. In an effort to break my smartphone addiction, I’ve joined a small group of people turning their phone screens to grayscale — cutting out the colors and going with a range of shades from white to black. First popularized by the tech ethicist Tristan Harris, the goal of sticking to shades of gray is to make the glittering screen a little less stimulating. I’ve been gray for a couple days, and it’s remarkable how well it has eased my twitchy phone checking, suggesting that one way to break phone attachment may be to, essentially, make my phone a little worse. We’re simple animals, excited by bright colors, it turns out. Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google know this, and they have increasingly been turning to the field of applied neuroscience to see how exactly brains respond to color in the apps, what brings pleasure and what keeps the eye. New research shows how important color is to our understanding of priorities and emotion. But not everyone wants to be so enamored with their screen. This week, two major investors asked Apple to figure out how to help parents limit their children’s use of iPhones and iPads, citing concerns over “long-term health.” There’s also a growing movement among some early tech employees warning against the products they’ve built. And many consumers are starting to wonder what this is all doing to our minds. Mack McKelvey, the chief executive of the marketing firm SalientMG in Washington, D.C., said she’s aware of the tricks phones use to keep you on them longer — and coming back sooner. “You don’t buy black-and-white cereal boxes, you buy the really stimulating colored one, and these apps have developed really cool tiles, cool shapes, cool colors, all designed to stimulate you,” Ms. McKelvey said. “But there’s a vibrant world out there, and my phone shouldn’t be it.” She decided to make the switch to gray as well. But it was trickier than she expected. “It took like 40 minutes to figure it out. They buried the setting,” she said. “You have to really want to do it.” (If you want to try, here are some tips.) One person Facebook and others turn to is Thomas Z. Ramsoy, the chief executive of Neurons, a four-year-old company based in Copenhagen. His business uses brain scans and eye tracking technology to study apps, updates and future technology. The company often measures the electrical activity of the brain while a consumer is interacting with a phone, such as texting and scrolling Facebook. The goal, Mr. Ramsoy said, is usually for a product to inspire happy emotions and draw attention without freaking a consumer out. For the past year, he said, Facebook has been its largest client, publicizing some of the research. “There is so much business now, we pinch ourselves,” he said. “Color and shape, these are the icebreakers when it comes to grabbing people’s attention, and attention is the new currency,” he said. “Having an interface that grabs people’s attention without disturbing them in the wrong way, without consciously intruding in their space, that’s the line fine.” What going grayscale does, Mr. Ramsoy said, is reintroduce choice. Companies use colors to encourage subconscious decisions, Mr. Ramsoy said. (So that, for example, I may want to open email, but I’ll end up on Instagram, having seen its colorful button.) Making the phone gray eliminates that manipulation. Mr. Ramsoy said it reintroduces “controlled attention.” “It’s a very good idea,” he said. “You have to take away the sound as well.” One way Silicon Valley could help ease phone addiction is by using a more thoughtful color palette, said Bevil Conway, an investigator at the National Eye Institute, who researches color and emotion. “Color’s not a signal for detecting objects, it’s actually something much more fundamental: It’s for telling us what’s likely to be important,” Mr. Conway said. “If you have lots of color and contrast then you’re under a constant state of attentional recruitment. Your attentional system is constantly going, ‘Look look look over here.’ ” The same way people think about a color scheme when they’re planning the living room décor, Mr. Conway said, they should think about color when it comes to their phone’s home screen too. “If you had a color palette, you would end up with a phone that looked pleasant and was not addictively rewarding, that had some intentionality, but of course nobody wants you to do that,” he said. “Because what they want is for you to look.” Silicon Valley is in a battle for our attention, and often I feel like the last person in charge of my own eyes. After going to grayscale, I’m not a different person all of a sudden, but I feel more in control of my phone, which now looks like a tool rather than a toy. If I unlock it to write an email, I’m a little less likely to forget the goal and tap on Instagram. If I’m waiting in line for coffee, this gray slab is not as delightful a distraction as it once was. The switch made me realize, in a tangible way, that I still have a little choice here.\0.5802182555198669,-0.8176392316818237,0.40759995579719543,0.2005894035100937,-0.8710082173347473,-0.42670735716819763,1.3443982601165771,0.18505260348320007,-0.7344093918800354,-0.5310909152030945,1.3137333393096924,0.5538389682769775,0.46523672342300415,0.6962364315986633,-0.7487610578536987,-0.4698278307914734,-0.3594106435775757,0.7529101371765137,0.01914021372795105,-0.7429458498954773,-0.15415048599243164,-1.7956129312515259,1.1239895820617676,-1.427697777748108,-0.14531604945659637,0.27625134587287903,1.076686143875122,-0.1732688546180725,0.6412408947944641,0.2995801568031311,0.513544499874115,1.3948570489883423,0.910925567150116,0.2718922197818756,0.09246013313531876,-0.1805594116449356,-0.8195728659629822,-0.9616832733154297,1.0503201484680176,0.13584206998348236,-0.4219260811805725,-2.0850765705108643,1.399806261062622,-0.2548232078552246,-0.3282307982444763,-0.07290082424879074,0.5995768308639526,-0.5633702278137207,-0.46547290682792664,-0.48144394159317017,1.3917114734649658,-0.9141711592674255,-1.5397759675979614,-0.5786247849464417,0.15622523427009583,-0.009570938535034657,1.2761001586914062,1.5354132652282715,-1.0467593669891357,0.41431012749671936,-0.7875142693519592,-0.8298633694648743,-0.42682337760925293,-1.900546669960022,-1.0380098819732666,0.444099098443985,0.7275452017784119,1.0469616651535034,-0.8052014708518982,1.4843010902404785,1.1140148639678955,0.0899091437458992,-0.18498781323432922,-0.07017744332551956,-0.22253672778606415,0.15317262709140778,-1.7788985967636108,0.05216771364212036,-1.5717462301254272,-1.182573676109314,0.30797696113586426,0.14842583239078522,-2.3274364471435547,0.6919315457344055,0.034788329154253006,0.07133299112319946,0.27427592873573303,0.8394544720649719,-0.04882755130529404,0.6273236870765686,-0.24996839463710785,-0.04926237091422081,-1.0191673040390015,0.6327493190765381,-0.13937430083751678,-0.737952709197998,0.14917875826358795,0.21227499842643738,-1.8332185745239258,1.462758183479309\NYTIMES\Disruptions: Is the Answer to Phone Addiction a Worse Phone?\2018-01-18 14:50:50.0\
1734\Technology\SEATTLE — Jeff Bezos rubbed elbows last weekend with Halle Berry, Chris Hemsworth and other Hollywood celebrities at an after-party for the Golden Globes. In December, he walked the red carpet, along with Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, at a screening of “The Post” in Washington. On Friday, Mr. Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, made public their $33 million donation to a nonprofit that provides college scholarships to so-called Dreamers, young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. In October, he received an award for a donation to a marriage equality campaign. Jennifer Cast, an Amazon executive who solicited the donation from him, said at the event that they could have donated anonymously to the campaign. “But just as critical as the money was Jeff’s offer to let us publicly acknowledge their gifts,” she said. “By allowing us to take their donation public,” she added, “the world quickly knew that Jeff Bezos supported marriage equality.” The appearances and actions are a new look for Mr. Bezos. As he was shaping Amazon into one of the world’s most valuable companies, Mr. Bezos developed a reputation as a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan. He preferred to hunker down in Amazon’s hometown, Seattle, at least partly because he thought it was better for Amazon’s growing business, largely avoiding public causes and the black-tie circuit. But while Mr. Bezos — who at 54 is the world’s richest person, with a net worth of more than $100 billion — can afford virtually any luxury, obscurity is no longer among them. Amazon, now a behemoth valued at more than $600 billion, has become one of the faces of “big tech,” along with Apple, Alphabet’s Google and Facebook. These companies are facing a backlash. Amazon is under the microscope for what critics say is its corrosive effect on jobs and competition, and Mr. Bezos has become a bête noire for President Trump, who repeatedly singles out him and Amazon for scorn on Twitter. “People are starting to get scared of Amazon,” said Steve Case, a co-founder of America Online, who recently started an investment fund focused on start-ups in underserved areas, with Mr. Bezos among its contributors. “If Jeff continues to hang out in Seattle, he’s going to get a lot more incoming. Even for just defense reasons, he has to now play offense.” Mr. Bezos’ portfolio of other ventures has thrust him farther into the spotlight. In October 2013, he bought The Washington Post for $250 million, jump-starting a renaissance of the paper. In 2016, Mr. Bezos bought a $23 million home in Washington, one of the city’s most expensive, which is undergoing extensive renovations to make it a suitable party spot for the city’s political class. Nearby neighbors include former President Barack Obama and his family, and Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Mr. Bezos’ space start-up, Blue Origin, is also making its efforts more public, giving him another stage. The company is trying to rescue Earth by helping to move pollution-belching heavy industries off the planet. “He’s getting thanked at the Golden Globes and targeted by presidential tweet tantrums — not even Steve Jobs had that kind of pop-culture currency,” said Margaret O’Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, who curated a museum exhibit in Seattle endowed by Mr. Bezos. In a statement, Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, said, “Jeff loves what he is doing, at Amazon, Blue Origin and The Washington Post, and he enjoys sharing his enthusiasm in public as he works with the teams to build and invent.” But interviews with more than 30 people who know Mr. Bezos, most of whom declined to be identified to protect their relationships with him, revealed his awareness of the growing opposition to Amazon and his growing comfort with being in the public eye. Mr. Bezos, they said, accepts the probability of greater government scrutiny of Amazon. The chief executive has advised Amazon executives to conduct themselves so that they can pass any legal or regulatory test. The investor Warren E. Buffett, who has known Mr. Bezos since the 1990s, said the cautionary tale of Microsoft, which faced a landmark antitrust case by the government that decade, must loom in Mr. Bezos’ mind. Microsoft, by far the most dominant technology company at the time, lost its footing after the case, opening an unexpected opportunity for competitors. “You’re going to get a lot of scrutiny if you’re disrupting other people’s livelihoods,” Mr. Buffett said. Some of the people who know Mr. Bezos said his new public face was for business expediency. Others believe it is a result of personal growth. But they all said it was clear that Mr. Bezos and Amazon were trying to go beyond his tech persona to show the world his other sides. Mr. Bezos has always been happy to play the role of Amazon’s chief pitchman, especially when he perceives some benefit to Amazon customers from doing so, people who have worked with him said. He submits to interviews and speaks at events when, for instance, a new company product like the Kindle electronic reader or Echo speaker needs to be explained to the world. But for nearly two decades, he was adamant that the company should largely stay out of the political limelight and not make a stir in local communities. It also had a bare-bones lobbying operation. Even as he was named Time magazine’s person of the year in 1999, he tried to avoid politics. He was even reluctant to do photo opportunities with politicians, standard fare for executives, one longtime former employee said. There were business benefits to staying out of the glare. A hedge fund executive in New York who caught the internet bug early, Mr. Bezos piled into a vehicle with his wife in 1994 with the intention of finding a place to start a business selling books on the internet. He founded Amazon later that year in Seattle, in part because of the growing pool of technical talent Microsoft had brought to the area. But putting his start-up in Washington also meant Amazon would not have to collect sales tax in the country’s most populous states, like California, Texas and New York. Retailers typically have an obligation to collect sales tax in states where they have a physical presence. For a time, for the same reason, the company would not publicly discuss where most of its warehouses were. And Amazon employees in Seattle who planned to travel out of state for work had to submit itineraries for review to avoid triggering unwanted sales tax liabilities. Those efforts would, in turn, give his fledgling company a further price advantage against established physical retailers like Barnes & Noble. It also meant that, despite its growing legions of customers, Amazon remained almost invisible in politics. By the end of 2012, the company had swelled to more than 88,000 employees and over $61 billion in annual sales, creating huge businesses like its Prime membership service and Amazon Web Services along the way. Yet that year the company was criticized by leaders in Seattle and the news media for being disengaged from civic life compared with stalwarts like Boeing and Starbucks. “I’m not aware of what Amazon does in the community,” Sally Jewell, the chief executive of the retailer R.E.I. at the time, said in The Seattle Times in 2012. “It’s not a name that comes up often in the nonprofit organizations I’m involved with.” With investors, Mr. Bezos gave just enough of a peek at Amazon’s business to win their confidence while saying as little as possible to keep competitors guessing. To this day, Amazon will not disclose exactly how many Kindles, Echoes and other devices it has sold, and for years it refused to reveal financial details about Amazon Web Services, its highly profitable cloud computing business. Despite the paucity of details, investors have sent its stock up more than 1,100 percent over the last decade, dazzled by its growth. A turning point came for Mr. Bezos around 2011 when Amazon faced a public showdown with state governments. At the time, legislators began hounding internet retailers like Amazon to collect sales tax. In California, Amazon initially campaigned to overturn a new law imposing an internet sales tax. But Mr. Bezos backed off after it became clear that Amazon’s image could be tarnished, a former employee involved in the matter said. Instead, Amazon began to make peace. In 2011, it signed an agreement with California to collect sales tax in the state, reaching numerous similar agreements around the same time. As part of those state deals, Amazon began building warehouses across the country, which allowed Amazon to deliver orders more quickly and let local politicians trumpet the arrival of thousands of jobs. Suddenly, a company that once refused to confirm how many employees it had at its Seattle headquarters could not stop talking about how many jobs it was creating. It now has 542,000 employees. As Mr. Bezos and the company talked about creating jobs, though, he and Amazon faced a counternarrative from critics that the company was really a job-killing bully. Waves of store closings by bricks-and-mortar retailers like Barnes & Noble and Macy’s increased the volume. ”Amazon Must Be Stopped,” read a 2014 New Republic article about the company’s growing market power. That year, a nasty fight over e-book prices with Hachette, the book publisher, solidified Amazon’s reputation for using brass-knuckle tactics. At one point, Amazon slowed delivery times for the publisher’s titles and took other steps to make them less attractive to order. After the matter was resolved, Mr. Bezos told an interviewer that Amazon was simply negotiating hard on behalf of its customers. “It’s very difficult for incumbents who have a sweet thing to accept change,” he said, referring to book publishers. Another blow to the company’s public standing landed in 2015 when The New York Times published a lengthy examination of Amazon’s corporate work culture, which was depicted as an unforgiving environment. “The article doesn’t describe the Amazon I know or the caring Amazonians I work with every day,” Mr. Bezos said in an email to the company’s employees after the article came out. According to two people who work closely with Mr. Bezos, the chief executive became more focused on corporate reputation issues after The Times article and the Hachette uproar. By late 2015, a few months after Mr. Trump announced his campaign for president, he started his Twitter broadsides against Mr. Bezos, which often coincided with critical coverage of the candidate in The Washington Post. “The @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon!” he tweeted in December that year. “Big tax shelter.” Mr. Bezos responded by offering to launch the future president of the United States into space on a Blue Origin rocket. A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. The attention in Washington edged up in June when Amazon announced it was buying Whole Foods Markets. Though Amazon remains a niche player in the grocery business, the deal drove home the power of the company and led some lawmakers to question its power. “The purchase of Whole Foods was a moment when people looked up and recognized this company as a force in the economy,” said Stacy Mitchell, a co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit advocacy group for local businesses, which has published a critical report on Amazon’s impact on jobs and communities. People who have known Mr. Bezos for a long time say they see a concerted effort by him and Amazon to show more of his personality. He became an active user of Twitter in late 2015, posting a photo of himself wearing his lucky cowboy boots and a video clip of him standing atop a wind turbine in Texas. At an event with his brother in Los Angeles in November, as part of a long lineup of presentations by an array of business, wellness and entertainment leaders, he said his ideal job would be bartender, partly because he enjoys talking to people. “I pride myself on my craft cocktails,” he said. If there’s an image that captures Mr. Bezos at the moment, it’s a picture of him with his biceps bulging out of a polo shirt at a business conference in Idaho from July. “Swole Jeff Bezos” instantly became an internet meme, with one tweet juxtaposing shots of a doughy Mr. Bezos from the late 1990s (caption: “I sell books”) and the brawny 2017 version (“I sell whatever I want”). The details people are willing to talk about include scraps about his daily routine. On most days, he leaves his lakefront estate in the affluent town of Medina, Wash., for a sparkling new 37-story office tower in Seattle, where he runs Amazon. On Wednesdays, he heads south to an industrial office park in the suburb of Kent, where rockets are assembled for Blue Origin. Every other week, he huddles on conference calls with The Post’s leadership, and twice a year they visit him at his home. He communicates with the newspaper’s top brass with an email list called the Pancakes Group. The Amazon chief once made members of the group flapjacks from a favorite recipe in “Joy of Cooking” on their first visit to his house. “It wasn’t like we went to some billionaire’s house and the help outnumbered the guests,” said Shailesh Prakash, the newspaper’s chief information officer. “He was trying to get the dog off the couch.” Mr. Bezos’ more public-facing work was abetted by a management change nearly two years ago at Amazon, when he put Jeff Wilke in charge of its consumer business and Andy Jassy in charge of cloud computing. That freed him up to devote more time to The Post and Blue Origin, though he remains deeply engaged at Amazon, dedicating most of his time to initiatives that are two to four years away from hitting the market. Mr. Bezos has also pushed using publicity to the company’s advantage. In September, he masterminded the company’s splashy search for a place to locate a second headquarters. In the hoopla, Amazon highlighted the jobs it planned to create with the move — up to 50,000 total — and spurred a horde of towns, from Dallas to Boston, to apply. In the future, that means Mr. Bezos will most likely be a more familiar presence in Washington. Mr. Bezos now visits Washington about 10 times a year, dropping in at The Post for forums, discussions with engineers and meals with journalists. In the capital’s stately Kalorama neighborhood, just off Massachusetts Avenue’s row of embassies, renovations are proceeding on his home — two combined properties that used to be the city’s Textile Museum. Mr. Bezos plans to host salon-style dinners at the house, drawing inspiration from the celebrated dinner parties thrown by Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Post, for the city’s movers and shakers from both parties. Mr. Bezos is known for asking his dinner guests to stick to a single conversation topic at a time to keep people from splintering off into private side discussions. “It’s a very big house,” said Martin Baron, the executive editor of The Post. “I hope he has a party for us in the house.” Sally Quinn, a longtime Post writer and an arbiter of the city’s social mores, said she had no firsthand knowledge of Mr. Bezos’ plans for his home. But she praised the idea of attempting to bring together guests from across the political spectrum. “There’s really no one who is doing that kind of thing in Washington right now,” said Ms. Quinn, who bumped into Mr. Bezos recently at the screening of “The Post.” “It would be like a throwback to the old days.” “I think Jeff,” she said, “is the only person who could do that.”\1.7603968381881714,-0.6346113085746765,-1.0420488119125366,1.5888851881027222,0.18744979798793793,-1.701514482498169,1.613364815711975,0.4547591805458069,-3.3943889141082764,-1.4197620153427124,-0.4503817856311798,-0.7161044478416443,-0.9652258157730103,-0.017046814784407616,-1.959140419960022,-0.8265784382820129,-0.8739542961120605,0.7216277718544006,-0.8888797163963318,-0.32634222507476807,0.7766923308372498,0.7168582677841187,-0.6152536273002625,0.04345237836241722,-0.3097855746746063,1.8830293416976929,1.7220865488052368,1.8384766578674316,-0.4864148199558258,-0.9481652975082397,1.7417024374008179,0.8542124032974243,1.021035075187683,0.47672396898269653,-0.5782583355903625,-1.2729853391647339,-1.0054055452346802,1.5216331481933594,0.252400666475296,-1.1842904090881348,0.32457536458969116,-0.7203723192214966,1.6711821556091309,-0.20489081740379333,-0.7702863812446594,-2.045743465423584,-0.061228394508361816,0.6695519089698792,-1.300192952156067,-0.07737793028354645,1.522634506225586,-1.2149274349212646,-0.3357792794704437,-0.7886605858802795,1.73267662525177,-0.09187598526477814,1.353310465812683,0.6041138172149658,-2.3324568271636963,2.0087811946868896,-0.6724329590797424,-1.3260234594345093,0.8639554381370544,-1.0487054586410522,-2.359976053237915,0.5339316129684448,-0.008706701919436455,1.2606490850448608,-1.8163187503814697,0.2721097767353058,1.0968513488769531,1.1309387683868408,0.08552669733762741,-0.3735489547252655,-1.2110284566879272,1.6195217370986938,0.5455912947654724,-0.8058112859725952,-1.834484338760376,-1.6054610013961792,-0.08672674745321274,-1.003442645072937,-2.677457332611084,2.616943359375,0.9245067238807678,0.989399254322052,-0.7392022609710693,1.1200501918792725,1.605813980102539,-0.5187389254570007,-0.03982273489236832,1.9499067068099976,-2.3346002101898193,0.45982128381729126,-0.5519721508026123,-0.40155288577079773,-0.9378923773765564,-1.7969183921813965,-1.6778414249420166,-0.20188699662685394\NYTIMES\Jeff Bezos, Mr. Amazon, Steps Out\2018-01-15 00:01:24.0\
1735\Technology\Machines are starting to take the place of the people who flip burgers, drive across town and, lately, manage stock portfolios. Artificial intelligence is taking on a bigger role in making investment decisions. A.I., including an ability to analyze data and actually learn from it, is considered useful in executing certain investing models, such as high-frequency trading, and in helping fund managers with tasks that rely on gathering and interpreting reams of information. Going a step further, an exchange-traded fund introduced in October uses A.I. algorithms to choose long-term stock holdings. It is to early to say whether the E.T.F., A.I. Powered Equity, will be a trendsetter or merely a curiosity. Artificial intelligence continues to become more sophisticated and complex, but so do the markets. That leaves technology and investment authorities debating the role of A.I. in managing portfolios. Some say it will only ever be a tool, valuable but subordinate to its flesh-and-blood masters, while others envision it taking control and making decisions for many funds. “We are just beginning to see a rise of the machines in investment management,” said Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University. Although, he said, “it’s hard to define what the markets will look like” if human judgment is usurped, he predicted that “in the end, it will be a good thing for investors.” Artificial intelligence is a term that may be spoken more than understood. Many investment firms use software to sift through data and perform rudimentary analysis by following fairly simple rules. The programs can create portfolios by screening universes of stocks to select ones that meet criteria related to corporate results, valuation metrics or trading patterns, or by tweaking the proportions of the constituent companies in an index based on certain factors. Those programs may be useful, but they are not A.I. because they are static; they do the same thing over and over until someone changes them. A.I. involves machine learning, in which a program updates itself as new information comes in. Whatever goal the program was created to achieve remains the same, but the problem-solving tools it uses keep changing and reflect the sum of the information it has to work with. Large fund management companies like Fidelity and Vanguard say they use A.I. for a range of purposes, but they decline to be specific. BlackRock says it relies on it for heavy cognitive lifting, often by scouring data to tease out patterns that might remain obscure to human eyes and brains. Examples offered by Jessica Greaney, a company spokeswoman, include identifying and trying to exploit nonintuitive relationships between securities or market indicators, perusing social media “to gain insights on employee attitudes, sentiment and preferences,” and monitoring search engines for words being entered on particular topics, say cars or luxury goods. These algorithms play a supporting role in BlackRock’s investing, Ms. Greaney said. Decisions on what to buy and sell are made by living, breathing managers. The A.I. Powered Equity E.T.F. is different. It uses algorithms to go the last mile and select its holdings, usually 30 to 70 stocks, said Art Amador, one of the founders of EquBot, the company that created the fund. He had the assistance of an I.B.M. program that fosters technology start-ups, and the E.T.F. runs most of its calculations on I.B.M.’s Watson supercomputer. “EquBot’s A.I. tech mimics the investment process of an army of equity research analysts working around the clock,” Mr. Amador said. “It has data on 6,000 companies, one million articles and filings a day, and data on market sentiment.” Beyond sorting through that information and using its programming to ensure it has what it considers the optimal portfolio — the fund typically makes at least one trade every day — it constantly fine-tunes its stock-picking methods. Mr. Amador says that artificial intelligence has an edge over the natural kind because of the inherent emotional and psychological weaknesses that encumber human reasoning. “When it comes to traditional portfolio management, managers are going to talk to analysts and sector specialists, but these people have biases and incentives,” he said. “The algorithm doesn’t have them.” What it also doesn’t have is a superior track record. Between Oct. 18, when it began trading, and the end of the year, the E.T.F. rose 3.1 percent, compared with a 5.1 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. Mr. Amador attributed the underperformance to a normal variability in returns. The fund’s programming beat the market when tested against historical data, he said, and he expects the same in real life as time passes. Others aren’t so sure how effective A.I. will be when put in charge of otherwise ordinary funds. Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment firm Research Affiliates, noted that A.I. can process immense amounts of data; the flip side is that it needs immense amounts of data for the algorithms to learn. Certain activities, like high-frequency trading, process market information tick by tick and seek to profit from making numerous trades and holding positions for matters of hours or minutes. Compared with conventional investing, this sort of trading gives A.I. programs more data, Mr. Arnott said, but it is limited in scope to patterns related to stock price movements, not the broader economic and commercial landscape. When it comes to managing long-term portfolios, however, there are too many moving parts in financial markets for A.I. to get its mechanical head around, in his view, and too many humans with flaws, motivations and unpredictable behavior doing the moving. He says the markets are far more complex than the games like chess and backgammon that A.I. algorithms have mastered. Tim Clift, chief investment strategist at Envestnet PMC, a firm that helps build portfolios, said that while artificial intelligence can give managers an edge, it is “a little gimmicky at this point.” “We know the markets are irrational, especially in the short term,” he said, “but the machines aren’t going to know how to behave in that kind of environment.” Gregg Fisher, a portfolio manager at the Gerstein Fisher Funds, cautioned that A.I. programs could be stumped by off-the-wall and out-of-the-blue developments that have no obvious analogues in their databases. They learn “by studying past patterns that they expect to continue,” he said. Referring to the events that precipitated the global financial crisis, he wondered: “How would A.I. have observed and planned for that? The quantity of different things that can happen is seemingly unlimited.” But for advocates of A.I., like Mr. Harvey at Duke, the ability to gather data and put it to good use also seems to be unlimited. He expects great strides in machine learning in the decades to come, allowing A.I. to assume a major role in how funds are managed and by whom. “Larger firms will be providing information to managers that other firms have no chance of getting” because they can’t afford the necessary data management systems, he said. The result will be “15 to 25 investment management superpowers that can harvest all that data.” Maybe so, but some investment professionals prefer to give the final say to portfolio managers who were born, not made. “I’m a fan of automating everything possible, but having a human being push the last button is still a good thing,” Mr. Fisher said. “Hopefully, we all get better and better and smarter and smarter, but there’s something comforting about having an informed human being with sound judgment at the end of the process.”\1.768572211265564,-0.11365317553281784,-0.6100886464118958,-0.051761552691459656,-0.6397412419319153,1.3372310400009155,-0.8678427934646606,-1.205568552017212,-1.1827125549316406,1.3551034927368164,1.2895689010620117,0.6824181079864502,0.03755151852965355,0.028095869347453117,-0.4280474781990051,-1.0536171197891235,-1.220476746559143,0.6520057916641235,-1.4478447437286377,-0.19389039278030396,-1.0032159090042114,-0.5270241498947144,0.4745849072933197,-2.687950611114502,-1.6438347101211548,3.1041626930236816,0.7711498141288757,-2.0002636909484863,-0.425764799118042,-0.8500231504440308,-1.013126015663147,1.6959906816482544,1.208526849746704,-1.5891505479812622,-1.6499236822128296,-1.426094889640808,0.5569022297859192,-1.1053612232208252,1.0435622930526733,-0.8839502930641174,0.5690984725952148,0.027560411021113396,1.308135986328125,-0.2227388173341751,-0.9305175542831421,-2.021836042404175,-0.5092778205871582,0.6300485730171204,-0.6134245991706848,0.5355015993118286,1.984954833984375,-0.578870415687561,-1.076004981994629,1.0973210334777832,0.40495380759239197,0.8365560173988342,0.33870476484298706,0.2900997996330261,-0.05121570825576782,1.2820427417755127,-2.4501545429229736,-0.4499731957912445,0.3458400070667267,-1.1174603700637817,-2.593204975128174,0.48687946796417236,1.330033540725708,2.9356186389923096,-0.9219439029693604,0.05270451679825783,-1.3617010116577148,0.6260508298873901,-1.1670300960540771,0.6933978796005249,0.1853511780500412,1.1017364263534546,-1.2853400707244873,0.38401636481285095,-2.1469786167144775,-1.2492326498031616,0.9963595271110535,0.8157367706298828,-1.1235989332199097,1.0943479537963867,-1.93003511428833,0.41433027386665344,-0.2660137712955475,0.5538077354431152,0.4405685067176819,-0.9160135388374329,-0.2557717561721802,0.03613298013806343,-0.6390882134437561,2.8674490451812744,-1.0928574800491333,0.5112800002098083,0.6354400515556335,-0.38702088594436646,-1.5308363437652588,0.049247946590185165\NYTIMES\A.I.

1736\Technology\The advent of self-driving cars, the subject of so much fanfare over the last few years from automakers and technology companies, may be just around the corner — at least according to General Motors. On Friday, G.M. said it had submitted a petition to the United States Department of Transportation seeking permission to begin operating fully autonomous cars — without steering wheels or pedals — in a commercial ride-hailing service next year. What’s more, the company said the vehicle, the Cruise AV, could be put into production on a standard assembly line once approval was granted by the federal government and states where the cars would operate. Self-driving technology “is only going to have a big impact if we can deploy it at large scale,” G.M.’s chief financial officer, Dan Ammann, said in an interview. “We intend to launch a commercial ride-share service at commercial scale in 2019. That will begin in one city and scale up in that city and move to other cities after that.” The cars would most likely be used initially in a ride service created by G.M., rather than in a service run by an established company like Uber or Lyft, Mr. Ammann said. If approved, the Cruise AVs would probably appear first in San Francisco or Scottsdale, Ariz., where G.M.’s self-driving subsidiary, Cruise Automation, is conducting tests. In San Francisco, the division has set up a ride-hailing service using about 50 Cruise AVs, although the cars are available only for some of its 250 employees, not public customers. The Cruise AV is a version of the battery-powered Chevrolet Bolt. Mr. Ammann said it was reasonable to assume that mass production of the self-driving model would take place at a factory in Orion Township, Mich., that already makes Cruise AV prototypes and the Bolt, though he said there were no firm plans. With its announcement, G.M. appears to have a jump in the race to field self-driving cars. Ford Motor is also developing a car with no steering wheel or pedals, but has said it won’t go into mass production until 2021. The Cruise AV is a four-passenger vehicle with an array of radar, cameras and laser sensors that are clustered on its roof and allow the car to navigate city streets and recognize vehicles, pedestrians, intersections and other obstacles. Since it does not have a steering wheel, it has two passenger seats in front and a center console with a display screen and a few buttons and knobs for audio and climate control. G.M.’s petition calls for producing up to 2,500 Cruise AVs for use in commercial ride fleets. “Mass production and government regulation appear to be within General Motors’ grasp,” said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, an automotive data firm. “If government approval is granted, and G.M. begins providing autonomous taxi service to end users in multiple markets, we’ll officially be living in a world of self-driving cars.” Approval from the Transportation Department is expected to take several months, and then G.M. would need local clearance before it could provide rides in Cruise AVs to the public. Mr. Ammann said it was not clear how the department’s main auto-safety regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, would evaluate G.M.’s petition, and whether the agency would test the vehicles itself. The safety agency said Friday that it would give G.M.’s petition “careful consideration.” Local approval will depend on each state’s regulations, Mr. Ammann said. Michigan, for example, already allows cars with no steering wheels to operate on public roads. Other states would need to decide how to treat driverless cars. Industry analysts say automakers and technology companies could generate billions of dollars in revenue and profit by selling or leasing self-driving cars to ride services, taxi fleets and delivery companies. Ford said this week that it would work with Domino’s Pizza and a start-up delivery company, Postmates, to use its autonomous prototypes in limited commercial tests this year. Waymo, the autonomous-vehicle company spun out of Google, is testing its own fully autonomous cars in Arizona and California. Lyft and a technology start-up called Nutonomy recently began testing self-driving cars in Boston. Uber is running a pilot program in Pittsburgh. Tesla, G.M., Audi and other automakers are also developing driver-assistance systems that take over for drivers in certain conditions, such as cruising along a divided highway. Those technologies, however, require drivers to remain alert and are considered years away from becoming fully autonomous systems. G.M. is convinced that self-driving cars can play a significant role in reducing deaths and injuries from auto crashes. Traffic accidents kill more than 35,000 people a year, and 95 percent result from driver errors. Ride services with self-driving cars could also make it easier to get around without owning or renting a car — and producing those cars would help G.M. weather a shift away from individual ownership. “Ultimately we see a very big business opportunity around this,” Mr. Ammann said.\-0.157144233584404,-1.3472720384597778,-1.5388762950897217,-0.03631388768553734,0.5330087542533875,0.42395147681236267,0.4150148034095764,-0.06583590805530548,-0.783779501914978,0.22756217420101166,0.14257502555847168,-0.13364721834659576,0.8784705400466919,-0.47983992099761963,-1.2302592992782593,-1.1230090856552124,0.07483624666929245,0.9564008712768555,-0.6356985569000244,0.4683666229248047,0.03605423495173454,0.03391470015048981,0.6251540184020996,-1.94495689868927,0.06140076741576195,0.3463040292263031,0.0936071053147316,-0.33110544085502625,-0.35493236780166626,-0.10271738469600677,-1.2162883281707764,0.48275360465049744,1.1043651103973389,-0.6067705154418945,-0.5196723937988281,-0.3394538462162018,-0.6171432733535767,0.25852298736572266,0.2807851731777191,-0.9196375608444214,-0.6268075704574585,0.06922202557325363,0.37822502851486206,0.002281851600855589,-1.5675050020217896,-0.3852825462818146,-0.8815833330154419,0.7963107228279114,-0.9161304831504822,0.06851013004779816,1.16063392162323,-0.8792795538902283,0.5197312831878662,0.360757976770401,-0.4811597764492035,0.5356602072715759,-0.09062604606151581,-0.5166119337081909,-0.9076967239379883,0.4148339033126831,0.3390156328678131,0.2808728814125061,-0.7253082394599915,0.2077965885400772,-1.265784502029419,-0.018832165747880936,1.815400242805481,0.5413897037506104,-1.2265385389328003,0.9152495265007019,-0.8465144634246826,0.33495065569877625,-1.731286883354187,0.016034873202443123,0.9423739314079285,0.4916205406188965,-0.24584124982357025,1.5379509925842285,-0.5045092105865479,-1.6151089668273926,0.19313110411167145,0.3607581555843353,-1.1438026428222656,-0.18859077990055084,0.9612640738487244,-1.0677651166915894,1.3232316970825195,0.5330762267112732,0.9846025109291077,-1.1465036869049072,-0.03920542448759079,1.711629033088684,-0.6811627149581909,0.9994808435440063,-0.25410550832748413,0.7208887338638306,0.11373285204172134,1.5227913856506348,-1.5755420923233032,-0.013186752796173096\NYTIMES\G.M.

1737\Technology\SEATTLE — Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, on Friday injected himself into one of the most contentious political debates in the United States, announcing that he and his wife had donated $33 million to a college scholarship program geared toward young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. Mr. Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, gave the money to the nonprofit Dream.US. The group said the donation, the largest in its history, would finance scholarships for 1,000 high school graduates who have been allowed to stay in the United States under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The roughly 800,000 so-called Dreamers affected by the program face an uncertain future after President Trump said last year that he planned to end the protections. Uncertainty continued to swirl around the program this week, with a federal judge ruling that the Trump administration must maintain it as a legal fight over the president’s decision proceeds and Mr. Trump sending mixed signals about his willingness to strike a deal with Congress that would offer Dreamers a path to citizenship. Mr. Trump has regularly criticized Mr. Bezos, both for his role at Amazon and for his ownership of The Washington Post, which he bought in 2013. Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of sidestepping taxes and The Post of covering him unfairly. Don Graham, the publisher of The Post when Mr. Bezos bought the paper, is a founder of Dream.US. Mr. Bezos said in a statement that the donation was inspired by the example of his father, Miguel, who came to the United States from Cuba in the early 1960s as part of a wave of thousands of unaccompanied minors. “My dad came to the U.S. when he was 16 as part of Operation Pedro Pan,” Mr. Bezos said in the statement. “He landed in this country alone and unable to speak English. With a lot of grit and determination, and the help of some remarkable organizations in Delaware, my dad became an outstanding citizen, and he continues to give back to the country that he feels blessed him in so many ways. MacKenzie and I are honored to be able to help today’s Dreamers by funding these scholarships.” Mr. Bezos is not the first wealthy technology executive to donate to Dream.US. Two years ago, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and his wife, Priscilla Chan, gave the group $5 million.\0.03962486609816551,-0.020135754719376564,0.020877370610833168,-0.06973472237586975,1.4755393266677856,-0.6863582730293274,0.731402575969696,0.5178020000457764,-0.4699237644672394,-0.5407751798629761,0.929042637348175,0.6580037474632263,-0.29936155676841736,0.4813804030418396,-0.45378902554512024,-0.3233153223991394,0.05177284777164459,-0.04906224459409714,0.3608468770980835,-0.2568162977695465,-0.1248471736907959,-0.5087941884994507,0.4332384765148163,0.09218648821115494,-0.43226125836372375,0.1615293174982071,0.5925922393798828,0.5401023626327515,-0.45574599504470825,-0.13630186021327972,0.2690633237361908,0.43692246079444885,-0.4599200487136841,0.3542390763759613,0.3655627369880676,0.15807516872882843,-0.404110848903656,0.5990291833877563,-0.17103266716003418,-0.3868544101715088,-0.3713502585887909,-0.32257524132728577,0.28907328844070435,-0.3395697772502899,0.5740227103233337,-0.16690672934055328,0.07061496376991272,0.9451030492782593,-0.41674530506134033,0.5694751143455505,1.3811450004577637,-0.07091531902551651,0.2290092408657074,-0.6048280596733093,1.0106664896011353,0.055812351405620575,0.8081093430519104,0.04201235994696617,-0.8761272430419922,0.5577306747436523,0.03975481912493706,-0.2933957874774933,0.28787365555763245,-0.13707934319972992,-0.013380433432757854,0.7717463970184326,0.046784915030002594,0.43602511286735535,-1.150771141052246,0.2306670993566513,-0.0604986846446991,-0.27452269196510315,-0.15226545929908752,0.2519229054450989,-1.2992011308670044,0.1878969669342041,0.16883915662765503,0.6242547631263733,-0.2938023507595062,-0.473900705575943,0.5799880027770996,-0.016276663169264793,-1.010452151298523,-0.7543966174125671,0.06766162067651749,0.4785020053386688,1.040761113166809,1.1334145069122314,0.10796137899160385,-0.01971394754946232,0.2567402124404907,0.4166463613510132,-1.4446425437927246,-0.11779814958572388,-0.41251131892204285,-0.13316570222377777,-0.24080000817775726,-0.22544421255588531,-0.8075760006904602,-0.35008513927459717\NYTIMES\Jeff Bezos Jumps Into ‘Dreamer’ Fight With Gift for Scholarships\2018-01-13 00:32:22.0\
1738\Technology\Q. I used Google Hangouts for the first time in Berlin. Now, if I enter a new contact into Google Contacts, it assumes the phone number is German and I have to manually change it each time. Is there a way to change the default country? A. If your Google account seems to think you are still in Germany, one place to check for a “default country” designation is in the settings for the Gmail account that is associated with your Google Hangouts calls. In a web browser, log into that Gmail account and click the gear-shaped Settings icon in the upper-right corner of the Gmail window. On the Gmail Settings screen, click the General tab if it is not already selected. In the Phone Numbers section of the page, a “default country code” pop-up menu allows you to set the United States as your home base. Click the Save Changes button when you are finished. If you use Google Hangouts or Google Voice on any mobile devices, restart them after you have saved the changes on the computer. Google’s Hangouts Help page might have answers to other issues with the service. For those unfamiliar with the software, Google Hangouts can be used to make video calls, as well as telephone calls from the computer’s web browser; you need to have a Google Account and compatible hardware. A Google Hangouts app is available for Android and iOS devices, as is a Chrome browser extension. Google Hangouts can also send and receive text messages between users and groups.\1.0357416868209839,0.44621625542640686,-0.4649740755558014,0.09189289063215256,-0.5736249089241028,-0.03632989525794983,0.6730139851570129,-0.8447463512420654,-0.5590589046478271,-0.19804978370666504,0.3658140003681183,0.8035353422164917,0.22475185990333557,0.48001113533973694,-0.23554177582263947,0.4016968309879303,-0.010046793147921562,0.6077057719230652,0.26076748967170715,0.5829969644546509,-0.0397479347884655,-0.8714497089385986,-0.2627023756504059,-0.6972766518592834,0.03308701515197754,0.38549450039863586,0.12048415839672089,-0.1959940642118454,0.7000409364700317,0.422306090593338,0.11891436576843262,0.38603782653808594,0.4013465344905853,-0.6740060448646545,-0.5512802004814148,-0.42314600944519043,-0.08373057842254639,-0.24596689641475677,0.44157978892326355,-0.27308419346809387,0.011099345982074738,-0.6393601894378662,0.23983021080493927,1.1782195568084717,-0.45728209614753723,0.28825196623802185,0.6591536402702332,0.6782174110412598,-0.6736019849777222,-0.1380765736103058,0.9478772282600403,-0.14635246992111206,-0.7016785144805908,0.6335019469261169,0.9815863966941833,0.35611164569854736,-0.19113600254058838,-0.07133612036705017,0.3199363648891449,0.5575266480445862,0.12830279767513275,-0.25113919377326965,0.12647269666194916,0.27921080589294434,-0.34757351875305176,-0.5852382779121399,0.22988060116767883,1.0897548198699951,-0.897380530834198,-0.04632951319217682,0.3788144886493683,-0.042083386331796646,-0.515873372554779,-0.08852136135101318,-0.2468508780002594,0.7174224257469177,-0.3366844356060028,0.5248603224754333,-0.5184908509254456,-0.9918960332870483,0.38054776191711426,-0.38122302293777466,0.1417238861322403,0.9949225783348083,0.018103253096342087,0.03159984573721886,0.5763091444969177,0.29497185349464417,-0.3965248167514801,-0.44345083832740784,-0.7119870781898499,0.07914717495441437,-0.6703589558601379,0.1451437771320343,0.3151416778564453,0.8126073479652405,0.6942052841186523,-0.2233448028564453,-0.5041736960411072,0.13707335293293\NYTIMES\Tech Tip: Changing Country Codes With Google\2018-01-12 15:45:23.0\
1739\Technology\Facebook has overhauled how it ranks the posts, videos and photos that appear in its users’ News Feeds, introducing major changes on Thursday designed to put what friends and family have to say first. In short, you’ll see more posts from friends that have spurred lively debates in the comments. And you’ll see fewer cooking videos from brands and publications. Prioritizing what your friends and family share is part of an effort by Facebook to help people spend time on the site in what it thinks is a more meaningful way. Facebook is making the changes by tinkering under the hood, reconfiguring its algorithms that guess what you may be most interested in. Here’s what it means for you. Facebook is not being coy about this: Those third-party organizations that took over large swaths of your News Feed years ago — sites that post funny pictures and memes, sell you clothing, or deliver articles about the world — will have the visibility of their posts scaled back under the new arrangement. In a post on the company’s blog Thursday, the head of its News Feed team, Adam Mosseri, wrote that showing more posts from friends and family “means we’ll show less public content, including videos and other posts from publishers or businesses.” For many people, that news will come as a relief. In December, Facebook itself acknowledged that passive consumption of information — surfing shopping websites or reading news articles like this one — is often bad for your mood. (Sorry!) It gestured toward a 2015 paper in the Journal of Experimental Psychology that showed that passive usage of the website, even for just 10 minutes a day, had a negative effect on students’ sense of well-being. Those who still want to see posts from their favorite brands and trusted, wonderful publishers, one of whose articles you may be reading at this very moment, will be able to. The options under the News Feed tab on Facebook will allow users to prioritize the pages (and friends) whose posts they are most interested in. And Mr. Mosseri explained that other posts that your Facebook connections find engaging will also rise to the top. Conversations stemming from live videos, celebrities’ posts, private groups and other highly interactive post types will be among those highlighted on the new News Feed. Without that kind of explicit direction, though, Facebook’s top priority will remain posts from your friends and family. “To do this, we will predict which posts you might want to interact with your friends about, and show these posts higher in feed,” Mr. Mosseri wrote. A video attached to his post said that indicators the algorithm takes into account are likes, comments and shares. Facebook will remain customizable, with the options that allow you to limit your exposure to certain people — even if those people are your pesky siblings or that one over-the-top uncle. One option is to quietly “snooze” a Facebook friend, which will cause their posts to disappear from your feed for 30 days. Facebook says that it has long been its policy that “friends and family come first,” language that appeared in the site’s “News Feed Values,” which were posted in 2016. Implicit in the changes that Facebook introduced this week is that for many users, the News Feed had become mindless scrolling, moving from one autoplaying video to the next, without offering people much of substance. It was serving up junk food. In an interview with The New York Times, Mark Zuckerberg said that it was the company’s expectation that many users would be gravitating to other sites to get their viral fix. But with more than two billion monthly users, Facebook has gained a foothold that allows it to play a longer game. And Mr. Zuckerberg said that if people begin to feel better while on the site, that Facebook’s business, and its users, will benefit. “I expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down,” he said in his post about the changes. “But I also expect the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable.”\1.2386059761047363,-0.8675256371498108,0.7454999685287476,-0.42458435893058777,0.2400677651166916,0.3295207619667053,0.3959733545780182,0.4358045160770416,0.13361379504203796,0.27959248423576355,0.5024310946464539,-0.35934174060821533,-0.7914668917655945,0.5578133463859558,-0.9210028052330017,0.8929937481880188,-0.35358375310897827,0.7711387872695923,0.9023818373680115,-0.7847800850868225,-0.47289788722991943,0.05168673023581505,-0.09651420265436172,-1.3040850162506104,-0.5071998238563538,0.9697060585021973,0.5591268539428711,0.6395919322967529,-0.24960482120513916,-0.6448673605918884,0.4221949279308319,1.069303274154663,-0.2116442322731018,-0.668140172958374,-0.09580907225608826,-0.2403758019208908,-0.10891661047935486,-0.02049177512526512,1.0280911922454834,0.38260602951049805,0.08614721894264221,-2.2073209285736084,1.6553661823272705,0.060931965708732605,-0.290108323097229,-0.07994552701711655,1.1121958494186401,0.16251546144485474,-1.6210157871246338,-0.1648917943239212,1.3578964471817017,0.06509954482316971,-3.028911828994751,0.6886590123176575,0.6528658866882324,-0.4437744617462158,1.5598334074020386,0.4118233323097229,-0.434791624546051,0.9614372253417969,-0.9705203771591187,-0.6068938970565796,-0.70091313123703,-0.10930221527814865,-0.563714325428009,0.14974898099899292,0.5648185014724731,2.4787938594818115,-0.881297767162323,0.9139285683631897,0.665654718875885,-0.3514930009841919,0.08258331567049026,-0.9216169714927673,-0.24508073925971985,-0.10242149233818054,0.6624398827552795,1.263512134552002,-0.3817521929740906,-1.54860520362854,0.6718481779098511,-0.44517701864242554,-1.6502774953842163,1.0006437301635742,0.31051236391067505,0.941336452960968,0.31573307514190674,-0.04594546556472778,0.43197667598724365,0.020107433199882507,-0.8612015843391418,0.3239743113517761,-1.0311261415481567,0.28300026059150696,0.07767146080732346,0.1562783569097519,-0.5602666735649109,-1.3212915658950806,-1.3704570531845093,0.14176727831363678\NYTIMES\Facebook Is Changing.

1740\Technology\Each week, Farhad Manjoo, technology columnist at The New York Times, reviews the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Hello, readers! Usually in this space, my colleague Mike Isaac and I chat about the week’s tech news. But Mike is now fixing to become a big-time author. For the next few months, he’ll be out on book leave, which leaves me free to run this show on my own! Strap in. Let’s talk about some of the big stories in tech this week. It’s that time of the year — CES! The world’s largest technology convention is again taking place in Las Vegas, bringing thousands of nerds to see some really cool stuff that will probably never be released. I kid, but that’s generally how this goes. CES used to be cool for all the new stuff companies unveiled there, but then it got so crowded that it didn’t make sense to put out your product in the torrent of announcements. Now the biggest companies skip the event, so we’re left with a lot of strange news from unheard-of companies. I didn’t attend this year, but from what I gathered from the coverage (including this fun report by my colleague Brian X. Chen), CES is full of robotic pets, luggage that drives itself, and lots and lots and lots of voice assistants for everything you can imagine. If you’d love to see a cavernous room full of talking refrigerators, this is the show for you. Also, there was a huge power failure on Wednesday. Fun! We should probably get used to such slim pickings at CES. As I’ve been saying for a while now, traditional “gadgets” seem to be dying. We saw more evidence of that trend this week when GoPro, the extreme-camera company, lowered its revenue forecast, shut down its effort to build a drone, laid off 20 percent of its staff and said it would be open to a sale. More and more gadgets, now, are really run off services or content in the cloud — Amazon’s Alexa, for instance, or the fitness videos created by Peloton, the fitness start-up I wrote about this week. On the other hand: When the self-driving suitcase is perfected, I’m buying one. When President Trump tweeted a threat of nuclear war against North Korea this month, it at the very least seemed to constitute a threat of violence that might violate Twitter’s terms of service. The company has lately been trying to crack down on abusive accounts. So some people on Twitter started to wonder, would the company possibly decide that Mr. Trump had crossed the line? Oh, no, not at all. On Monday, Twitter said the tweets of world leaders got special deference from the company; world leaders can now essentially say anything on Twitter. “Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate,” it said. I don’t think anyone is surprised by this. And I saw some good arguments for allowing the president to stay on Twitter. As Will Oremus at Slate argued, barring Mr. Trump from the site is a “misguided fantasy” that wouldn’t really stop the underlying problem of his saying things that many people consider outrageous. Still, I do think there’s something to the argument that Twitter — by its very nature a platform meant for people to yell things at the news, usually without nuance — encourages the sort of reflexive communication that we probably don’t want in our world leaders. Sure, if Twitter barred him, he could always just go on TV and say what he had planned to tweet. But that would be slower and less automatic, and perhaps — I’m going out on a limb here — he might not blurt out threats of nuclear war. We’re still seeing fallout from Meltdown and Spectre, the two big computer chip flaws that were announced last week. Intel said this week that its fixes for the two flaws would slow computers down by single-digit percentages; the exact performance hit depends on what you’re doing on your machine. This is a small slowdown, but it’s not insignificant. After all, people buy new computers for speed, so being hit with a slowdown after you’ve already purchased the thing is going to make lots of customers seethe. There’s a bigger story here: When technology is found to be insecure, many companies evade any great degree of responsibility for the problems. As Nathaniel Fick, chief executive of the security company Endgame, wrote in The Times, “Cybersecurity today is being treated like accounting was before the fallout from the Enron scandal.” There are few lasting repercussions for flaws, and after a time everything goes back to normal. Equifax, for example, has already partly recovered after its massive breach. Unless the government steps in with stricter penalties, this system seems headed for catastrophe. Everything is interconnected now; it’s only a matter of time until there’s a hack big enough to cause widespread social and economic disruption. We should probably do something about that, maybe? Finally, in a late-breaking update, Facebook said on Thursday that it would be making huge changes to make you feel less terrible about using the service. It’s an unusual goal for a tech company — Facebook plans to alter its News Feed to increase your interactions with friends and family and reduce how many posts you see from brands and publishers, all in an attempt to make the service more “meaningful” for users. The move could have wide repercussions for media outlets — which depend on Facebook for traffic — and potentially for Facebook’s own bottom line. But as with all Facebook product changes, it will probably be months before we know how the move plays out. One thing is for sure: Initially, you’re bound to hate it, because that’s just how it goes with anything new online. O.K., that’s it for now. Tune in next week for another Mike-free newsletter. Bye!

1741\Technology\Ssssh. Listen. Do you hear that? That resounding silence emanating from the fashion world about the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, a.k.a. one of the biggest consumer tech product events of the year? It was only three years ago that wearables were the buzzword of the runways, predicted to trend in closets everywhere. Now they barely merit a mention. It’s probably going too far to say that the love affair between fashion and technology is over. But it certainly seems to have cooled. While there are still plenty of designer-name smartwatches coming to market — Fossil just introduced a style in collaboration with Kate Spade; Louis Vuitton entered the sector last year, teaming up with Google and Qualcomm Technology — they are not generating nearly the same flushed excitement that they once did. Remember when? In 2015, Brian Krzanich, the chief executive of Intel, gave the opening keynote speech at CES introducing a buttonsize computing system called Curie that was touted as a tool to change how our clothes function. It was part of a wearables push that included a smart bracelet made in collaboration with Opening Ceremony and smart glasses made with Oakley. And that address followed the long-lead drumroll for the Apple Watch, which was introduced to the fashion crowd to great fanfare the previous September, just in time for fashion week. (There was so much breathless expectation over the product that some editors prioritized Cupertino, Calif., and the reveal over the New York ready-to-wear collections.) Marketed as a must-have accessory, the Apple Watch seemed a clear sign that Apple had its sights set on style, especially after the hiring of the former Yves Saint Laurent chief executive Paul Deneve and the former Burberry C.E.O. Angela Ahrendts in 2013, and the former Tag Heuer executive Patrick Pruniaux in 2014. The next year, it was announced that Apple had teamed up with Hermès to create straps and watch faces. More brand partnerships were rumored. Apple sponsored the Met Gala in 2016. But Mr. Pruniaux joined the Kering watch brand Ulysse Nardin last August and Mr. Deneve left Apple quietly later in the year. Though the watch’s market share has grown, increasingly, it seems as if most of the focus on wearables has shifted to health and functionality, as opposed to aesthetics, and most of fashion’s focus on technology has shifted to production and manufacturing (3-D printing, A.I.), not new categories of items. Maybe we should have expected it. I remember sitting in a Paris hotel room during the women’s wear shows as Jonathan Ive of Apple showed me the first Apple Watch and asking (I was skeptical) what it would do. He told me they didn’t really know; that they would have to see how people used it to understand what it would really become. Presumably that’s what’s going on now. When fashion and tech first started making goo-goo eyes at each other, there was a lot of speculation as to whether two such different worlds could ever really mesh. You could understand the attraction. Often as not they share the same consumer, who is making choices about whether to buy, say, a phone, or a coat. Design matters deeply to both sectors. There was a lot of talk about learning to speak each other’s language. And they probably have, to a certain extent. Smartwatches were the beginning. But if this is going to be a meaningful partnership, that can’t be the end. Especially because no matter how many designers and brands get involved, the end result seems to look pretty much the same. There is only so much you can do, style-wise, within the engineering limits of the wristwatch form. As a result, you get what we have now which is … yawn. The problem is still that, a few smart sportswear items aside, no one is really sure exactly what role technology should play in the rest of our wardrobe. What do we want our clothes to do, beyond what they already do? Maybe temperature control, often fantasized about. Maybe not. Because here’s the thing: Fashion choices have always communicated — about identity, values, community — pretty effectively to the world.

1742\Technology\SEOUL, South Korea — The world of Bitcoin — rarely free of wild ups and downs of late — has been rattled this week by word that South Korea is preparing a ban on trading in virtual currencies. The question is how real that threat might be. South Koreans have taken to digital tokens with fervor. The worldwide virtual currency boom that started last year has swept up savers young and old in South Korea, helping push up global prices. The government has expressed alarm. Officials, including the prime minister, have voiced concerns about an irrational frenzy. Raids by South Korean tax officials on digital currency exchanges this week have added to unease among investors. “I am so nervous,” said Kim Su-jin, a 50-year-old investor in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies who works as a bookkeeper at a women’s clothing store in Seoul. “My coins could become trash if the government closes the exchanges.” But South Korea does not appear to be done with cryptocurrencies quite yet. Several political leaders have already aired their opposition to a ban on Bitcoin trades, indicating that the public enthusiasm for virtual currencies just might be strong enough to shield them from further government intervention. The country’s justice minister, Park Sang-ki, said this week that his ministry was drawing up a bill that would include the complete shutdown of virtual currency exchanges, adding that trading in the tokens “has started to resemble gambling and speculation.” The most popular Bitcoin exchanges in South Korea process hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of transactions every day. Trades using the Korean won account for around 5 percent of the volume of Bitcoin trades globally. For now, the authorities do not appear to be of one mind on the subject. After Mr. Park’s comments on Thursday, a spokesman for President Moon Jae-in clarified that the Justice Ministry’s plan was not final, according to the Yonhap news agency. Then, on Friday, Kim Dong-yeon, the finance minister, emphasized that other ministries would be expected to confer on the Justice Ministry’s proposal, Yonhap reported. At the very least, a ban would not be passed quickly: Securing a majority of votes in the National Assembly could take months. More to the point, several lawmakers from major parties signaled this week that they would not support a crackdown. Park Young-sun, a member of the governing party who has no relation to the justice minister, wrote on her Facebook page that closing the exchanges would be like “setting fire to a straw-roofed house to catch a bedbug.” Ha Tae-kyung, a legislator with the opposition Bareun Party, wrote on Facebook that criminalizing virtual currencies would fly in the face of the administration’s claims to support new technologies. South Korean citizens have also voiced their opposition to a potential clampdown by signing petitions with the president’s office. The most popular of these has garnered more than 120,000 signatures. “The power of the individual investor is very huge in South Korea,” said Simon Seojoon Kim, chief executive of Hashed, a fund in Seoul that invests in virtual currency projects. The National Tax Service in South Korea declined to comment on why its representatives visited two major virtual currency exchanges, Bithumb and Coinone, this week. But Shin Won-hee, head of operations at Coinone, said the tax authorities had wanted to check that the company had paid proper corporate tax. Bithumb told local news outlets that it was cooperating with the investigation. Separately, the police in Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds Seoul, have been investigating whether Coinone is operating “a gambling site.” The company had previously allowed investors to buy and sell virtual currencies on margin — that is, to place bets using borrowed money. But Mr. Shin said that Coinone decided in November to stop allowing margin trading as government officials began expressing concerns about market overheating. Mr. Park, the justice minister, said this week that the depths of South Korean investors’ irrationality was reflected in the high premium — around 30 percent on Friday — that they paid on Bitcoin exchanges in South Korea over those elsewhere. Experts said that South Korean prices were also higher because the exchanges there did not allow trading by foreigners. That prevents overseas investors from selling Bitcoin in South Korea to profit from — and thereby help narrow — the price gap. South Korea’s isolation from the global market leads investors at home to seek better prices elsewhere. “We are seeing Koreans taking loads of cash to buy Bitcoin in Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia where Bitcoin is cheaper,” said Hong Ki-hoon, professor of economics at Hongik University in Seoul. With so many conflicting signals from the government, “I don’t think any of us think that these strong measures will actually be implemented,” said Hyon Hae-in, a 35-year-old Bitcoin investor. “Longtime investors see times like these as opportunities to trade,” she said.\-0.49639004468917847,-0.5157605409622192,-0.30447661876678467,0.09033797681331635,1.0412758588790894,-0.3587086796760559,-0.029666027054190636,-0.6800179481506348,-0.5370025038719177,-0.4389745593070984,-0.24729397892951965,-0.16440816223621368,1.2385153770446777,-0.4472355842590332,-0.9959710240364075,-0.10139461606740952,0.11926638334989548,-0.9951098561286926,1.0194759368896484,-0.16542555391788483,-0.7197702527046204,0.39231136441230774,0.22329846024513245,0.7569233775138855,-0.5454607605934143,-0.08850876241922379,0.12551002204418182,-0.3802960515022278,-0.8978449702262878,-0.4548027515411377,-0.34483805298805237,-0.03461606055498123,0.8133514523506165,-0.2371859848499298,-0.447986364364624,-1.0151448249816895,-0.754051148891449,-0.27723556756973267,-0.051057953387498856,-0.674382746219635,-0.522713303565979,-1.078715443611145,1.0265848636627197,-1.174555778503418,-0.6917285323143005,-0.41618749499320984,-1.941525936126709,0.5624087452888489,-0.3589800000190735,0.8899616003036499,0.7206030488014221,0.605842113494873,-0.6016926765441895,0.2574559450149536,0.49659502506256104,-1.9280779361724854,0.46872323751449585,-0.12535454332828522,-0.5880731344223022,1.2983485460281372,0.2224506437778473,-0.8724151253700256,1.230710506439209,0.0918816551566124,-1.7046548128128052,0.02351756952702999,0.5561869740486145,0.27916663885116577,-0.4541102945804596,0.017892146483063698,0.7911070585250854,0.603549063205719,-0.07337316125631332,-0.08175463229417801,-0.8325245380401611,0.9434387683868408,0.7158353924751282,-0.5034348368644714,-1.5539283752441406,-0.6288583874702454,0.2775145173072815,0.06560089439153671,-1.8219059705734253,0.7009029388427734,-0.5118080973625183,-0.4165327250957489,-0.6789258122444153,0.07712595164775848,-0.7110976576805115,-0.031920287758111954,0.12981092929840088,0.8263946771621704,-0.29101336002349854,-0.3848203718662262,0.0301936287432909,-1.1810250282287598,-1.5415244102478027,-0.7384393215179443,0.25621333718299866,0.891657292842865\NYTIMES\Why Is South Korea Spooking the Global Bitcoin Market?\2018-01-13 02:29:42.0\
1743\Technology\This week, a video surfaced of a Harvard professor, Steven Pinker, which appeared to show him lauding members of a racist movement. The clip, which was pulled from a November event at Harvard put on by Spiked magazine, showed Mr. Pinker referring to “the often highly literate, highly intelligent people who gravitate to the alt-right” and calling them “internet savvy” and “media savvy.” The clip went viral. The right celebrated; the left fumed. The neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website ran an article headlined, in part, “Harvard Jew Professor Admits the Alt-Right Is Right About Everything.” A tweet of the video published by the self-described “Right-Wing Rabble-Rouser” Alex Witoslawski got hundreds of retweets, including one from the white-nationalist leader Richard Spencer. “Steven Pinker has long been a darling of the white supremacist ‘alt-right,’” noted the lefty journalist Ben Norton. “And he returns the favor.” Others reacted to the rumor with simple exasperation: “Christ on a crutch,” said the liberal commentator and biologist PZ Myers, who also wrote a blog post denouncing Mr. Pinker for this supposed alliance. The idea that Mr. Pinker, a liberal, Jewish psychology professor, is a fan of a racist, anti-Semitic online movement is absurd on its face, so it might be tempting to roll your eyes and dismiss this blowup as just another instance of social media doing what it does best: generating outrage. But it’s actually a worthwhile episode to unpack, because it highlights a disturbing, worsening tendency in social media in which tribal allegiances are replacing shared empirical understandings of the world. Or maybe “subtribal” is the more precise, fitting term to use here. It’s one thing to say that left and right disagree on simple facts about the world — this sort of informational Balkanization has been going on for a while and long predates Twitter. What social media is doing is slicing the salami thinner and thinner, as it were, making it harder even for people who are otherwise in general ideological agreement to agree on basic facts about news events. That’s because the pernicious social dynamics of these online spaces hammer home the idea that anyone who disagrees with you on any controversial subject, even a little bit, is incorrigibly dumb or evil or suspect. On a wide and expanding range of issues, there’s no such thing as good-faith disagreement. The online anger aimed at Mr. Pinker provides a perfect case study. The clip was deeply misleading. If you watch the whole eight-minute video from which it was culled, it’s clear that Mr. Pinker’s entire point is that the alt-right’s beliefs are false and illogical — but that the left needs to do a better job fighting against them. The clip begins with Mr. Pinker saying he agrees with the other panelists (two journalists and a lawyer) that “political correctness has done an enormous amount of harm in the sliver of the population that might be — I wouldn’t want to say ‘persuadable,’ but certainly whose affiliation might be up for grabs.” This problem presents itself when it comes to “the often highly literate, highly intelligent people who gravitate to the alt-right: internet savvy, media savvy, who often are radicalized in that way, who ‘swallow the red pill,’ as the saying goes, the allusion from ‘The Matrix.’” Mr. Pinker goes on to argue that when members of this group encounter, for the first time, ideas that he believes to be frowned upon or suppressed in liberal circles — that most suicide bombers are Muslim or that members of different racial groups commit crimes at different rates — they are “immediately infected with both the feeling of outrage that these truths are unsayable” and are provided with “no defense against taking them to what we might consider to be rather repellent conclusions.” That’s unfortunate, Mr. Pinker argues, because while someone might use these facts to support bigoted views, that needn’t be the case, because “for each one of these facts, there are very powerful counterarguments for why they don’t license racism and sexism and anarcho-capitalism and so on.” He then goes on to carefully explain those counterarguments: For example, while at the moment it’s true that, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the homicide rate is higher for blacks than for whites, that doesn’t really tell us anything about a group of people since at different times in history, different groups have had elevated crime rates — at one point Irish-Americans did. By that same token, he says, “the majority of domestic terrorism is committed by right-wing extremist groups,” not Muslims. It would be impossible for a reasonable person to watch the eight-minute video and come away thinking Mr. Pinker’s point is to praise the alt-right rather than to make a psychological argument about political correctness, alt-right recruitment and how to better fight that movement’s bigoted ideas Now, maybe you disagree with certain parts of this argument — I do, in that I think Mr. Pinker overstates the intensity of campus political correctness — but it’s hard to have that debate in the first place when such a wildly skewed version of Mr. Pinker’s point is spreading like wildfire on the internet. Steven Pinker will be O.K. A fleeting Twitter blowup isn’t going to bruise his long and successful career as a public intellectual. But this is happening more and more — and in many cases to people who don’t have the standing and reputation he does. It’s getting harder and harder to talk about anything controversial online without every single utterance of an opinion immediately being caricatured by opportunistic outrage-mongers, at which point everyone, afraid to be caught exposed in the skirmish that’s about to break out, rushes for the safety of their ideological battlements, where they can safely scream out their righteousness in unison. In this case: “Steven Pinker said the alt-right is good! But the alt-right is bad! We must defend this principle!” This is making us dumber.\1.1771774291992188,-1.043118953704834,-0.24229268729686737,-0.47654059529304504,-0.07700029760599136,1.304918646812439,0.8583356738090515,1.522714614868164,-0.4446422755718231,0.05877552554011345,1.3953157663345337,1.0051223039627075,-0.8645931482315063,0.6720495820045471,0.07928930222988129,0.25554269552230835,0.48812049627304077,1.0278044939041138,-0.14292588829994202,0.3701070249080658,0.02998870424926281,-0.9567004442214966,0.8686912059783936,0.4535336494445801,-1.7889924049377441,0.33320286870002747,1.0763386487960815,-0.019924359396100044,-0.08250392228364944,-0.2713458240032196,0.8773044943809509,2.1250782012939453,1.1865246295928955,0.4231398105621338,0.21813198924064636,-1.0306724309921265,-0.4145122468471527,0.5714792013168335,-0.30644550919532776,-1.136824607849121,-0.21851707994937897,-1.5416936874389648,0.38333573937416077,0.468916118144989,-0.4344872832298279,0.7963210344314575,0.27050715684890747,0.3601880371570587,-1.7819520235061646,-0.7797006964683533,1.9711439609527588,-0.9787360429763794,-1.087476134300232,1.3901649713516235,1.5905506610870361,-0.8070530891418457,2.4849212169647217,1.2110233306884766,-0.6321657299995422,0.2234644889831543,-0.08076833188533783,0.2379336655139923,0.3494096100330353,-0.796800971031189,-2.012415885925293,0.8348279595375061,1.7803490161895752,0.7684097290039062,-0.7309120297431946,1.9864110946655273,0.8541505932807922,0.06793437153100967,-1.1755348443984985,-0.1464468389749527,-0.7224764823913574,0.5512434840202332,-0.5816906094551086,0.6443281173706055,-0.6347325444221497,-1.6921131610870361,0.45413753390312195,-0.43635302782058716,-1.9018383026123047,0.6331687569618225,0.09473459422588348,0.15952210128307343,0.04211891070008278,0.1846737265586853,-0.504253625869751,-0.6957628726959229,-1.4454916715621948,0.8831003308296204,-0.9954082369804382,0.4792516231536865,-0.9117016196250916,1.024747371673584,-0.04791102558374405,-1.1151196956634521,-2.2024948596954346,0.9026875495910645\NYTIMES\Op-Ed Contributor: Social Media Is Making Us Dumber. Here’s Exhibit A.\2018-01-12 04:45:18.0\
1744\Technology\SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook has introduced sweeping changes to the kinds of posts, videos and photos that its more than two billion members will see most often, saying on Thursday that it would prioritize what their friends and family share and comment on while de-emphasizing content from publishers and brands. The shift is the most significant overhaul in years to Facebook’s News Feed, the cascading screen of content that people see when they log into the social network. Over the next few weeks, users will begin seeing fewer viral videos and news articles shared by media companies. Instead, Facebook will highlight posts that friends have interacted with — for example, a photo of your dog or a status update that many of them have commented on or liked. The changes are intended to maximize the amount of content with “meaningful interaction” that people consume on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, said in an interview. Facebook, he said, had closely studied what kinds of posts had stressed or harmed users. The social network wants to reduce what Mr. Zuckerberg called “passive content” — videos and articles that ask little more of the viewer than to sit back and watch or read — so that users’ time on the site was well spent. “We want to make sure that our products are not just fun, but are good for people,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “We need to refocus the system.” Thursday’s changes raise questions of whether people may end up seeing more content that reinforces their own ideologies if they end up frequently interacting with posts and videos that reflect the similar views of their friends or family. And bogus news may still spread — if a relative or friend posts a link with an inaccurate news article that is widely commented on, that post will be prominently displayed. The goal of the overhaul, ultimately, is for something less quantifiable that may be difficult to achieve: Facebook wants people to feel positive, rather than negative, after visiting. “When people are engaging with people they’re close to, it’s more meaningful, more fulfilling,” said David Ginsberg, director of research at Facebook. “It’s good for your well-being.” Facebook has been under fire for months over what it shows people and whether its site has negatively influenced millions of its users. The company has been dogged by questions about how its algorithms may have prioritized misleading news and misinformation in News Feeds, influencing the 2016 American presidential election as well as political discourse in many countries. Last year, Facebook disclosed that Russian agents had used the social network to spread divisive and inflammatory posts and ads to polarize the American electorate. Those issues have landed Facebook in front of lawmakers, who have grilled the company about its influence last year. Next Wednesday, Facebook is set to appear at another hearing on Capitol Hill, along with Twitter and YouTube, about the online spread of extremist propaganda. The repercussions from Facebook’s new News Feed changes will almost certainly be far-reaching. Publishers, nonprofits, small business and many other groups rely on the social network to reach people, so de-emphasizing their posts will most likely hurt them. Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management at Facebook, who is responsible for running the News Feed, acknowledged that “there will be anxiety” from partners and publishers who often complain about the constant changes in what will be shown across the network. The change may also work against Facebook’s immediate business interests. The company has long pushed users to spend more time on the social network. With different, less viral types of content surfacing more often, people could end up spending their time elsewhere. Mr. Zuckerberg said that was in fact Facebook’s expectation, but that if people end up feeling better about using the social network, the business will ultimately benefit. Changes to Facebook’s News Feed are not new. The Silicon Valley company constantly experiments with what shows up in the News Feed, and in the past it has also said it would prioritize posts from users’ friends and family. But Thursday’s shift goes beyond previous changes by prioritizing posts that have generated substantive interactions. A long comment on a family member’s photo, for instance, might be highlighted in the News Feed above a video that has fewer comments or interactions between people. Facebook has conducted research and worked with outside academics for months to examine the effects that its service has on people. The work was spurred by criticism from politicians, academics, the media and others that Facebook had not adequately considered its responsibility for what it shows its users. After the 2016 election, for instance, Mr. Zuckerberg initially shrugged off qualms about Facebook’s effect on the outcome, even as outsiders pointed to the proliferation of fake news stories on the site that had attacked Hillary Clinton. Mr. Zuckerberg later said he had been too hasty and dismissive of the concerns. More recently, he began signaling that Facebook was rethinking what it shows people on the site. Last week, he posted on Facebook about his goals for 2018, including “making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent” and adding that “this will be a serious year of self-improvement and I’m looking forward to learning from working to fix our issues together.” On Thursday, he said many of the discussions about Facebook’s responsibilities had prompted the company “to get a better handle on some of the negative things that could happen in the system.” “Just because a tool can be used for good and bad, that doesn’t make the tool bad — it just means you need to understand what the negative is so that you can mitigate it,” he said. Facebook and other researchers have particularly homed in on passive content. In surveys of Facebook users, people said they felt the site had shifted too far away from friends and family-related content, especially amid a swell of outside posts from brands, publishers and media companies. “This big wave of public content has really made us reflect: What are we really here to do?” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “If what we’re here to do is help people build relationships, then we need to adjust.” Mr. Zuckerberg said he was now focusing his company around the new approach. Product managers are being asked to “facilitate the most meaningful interactions between people,” rather than the previous mandate of helping people find the most meaningful content, he said. Mr. Zuckerberg added that his way of running Facebook has shifted since the birth of his two daughters, Maxima and August, in recent years. He said he had rethought the way he views his and Facebook’s legacy, even if it will cost the company in the short term. “It’s important to me that when Max and August grow up that they feel like what their father built was good for the world,” Mr. Zuckerberg said.\0.49212154746055603,-1.1349272727966309,0.08241073042154312,0.563378632068634,-0.4656981825828552,1.4323424100875854,2.080875873565674,-0.36286240816116333,-0.41454461216926575,0.3773497939109802,0.5005576014518738,0.6899585723876953,-0.7977815270423889,1.343027114868164,-1.2854081392288208,-0.41605517268180847,0.7772002220153809,1.5858086347579956,-0.3332315683364868,-1.3913156986236572,-0.4166247844696045,-0.20925720036029816,1.067175269126892,-0.6976080536842346,-0.8066980838775635,1.1819339990615845,-0.11204639822244644,0.7637016773223877,-0.520767867565155,-0.33437711000442505,-0.04654025658965111,1.4218244552612305,1.1103547811508179,0.07683025300502777,0.7529696822166443,-1.0116896629333496,-0.5013580918312073,0.5192630290985107,0.5952244400978088,0.22130489349365234,-0.6647461652755737,-0.7541057467460632,1.335597276687622,-0.7190488576889038,0.1667328029870987,0.4568510949611664,1.8239408731460571,-0.22511602938175201,-1.0216165781021118,0.30396074056625366,-0.10132040083408356,0.022819286212325096,-1.6364574432373047,0.5051770806312561,0.8381461501121521,-1.0091230869293213,1.0701603889465332,0.3876703679561615,-0.16109168529510498,1.521097183227539,-0.4427652657032013,-1.2210837602615356,-0.27547863125801086,-0.338024377822876,-0.7664444446563721,-0.11023014038801193,-0.004809133242815733,1.5497502088546753,-0.48987042903900146,0.5126693248748779,0.6670759320259094,0.36683890223503113,-0.5401548743247986,-1.5773001909255981,-1.2452690601348877,0.6321544051170349,-0.5786585807800293,0.9528748989105225,-2.2505345344543457,-1.4714882373809814,0.4536995589733124,0.4610300064086914,-1.8328348398208618,1.4060463905334473,1.1050903797149658,1.1044847965240479,-0.25191807746887207,-0.11882701516151428,1.6817628145217896,-0.44879356026649475,-0.35664287209510803,0.35565391182899475,-2.991854190826416,0.8719176054000854,-0.6136154532432556,0.30765992403030396,0.31275755167007446,-2.050483465194702,-2.614142656326294,1.5947521924972534\NYTIMES\Facebook Overhauls News Feed to Focus on What Friends and Family Share\2018-01-12 02:12:51.0\
1745\Technology\Silicon Valley has birthed many highly valued and hugely hyped start-ups in recent years, including Uber, Airbnb and Pinterest. Few of those companies have made it out onto the stock market successfully. Now Dropbox, the online file storage company that is part of Silicon Valley’s closely watched pack of “unicorns,” plans to try its luck. The company has filed documents to go public, people briefed on the matter said on Thursday. If Dropbox — last valued by private-market investors at about $10 billion — follows through on an initial public offering, it will become one of the highest-profile technology companies of late to seek a stock market listing. The company is on track to join Spotify, the online streaming giant, on the public markets, with Uber, Lyft and Airbnb expected to follow suit in the next few years. Dropbox’s filing has implications for other Silicon Valley unicorns, which are companies that were privately valued at more than $1 billion. Last year, several much buzzed-about tech companies, including Snapchat’s parent company and Blue Apron, the meal kit delivery service, went public — and then promptly disappointed investors, raising questions about the durability of these businesses. And Wall Street investors must also be convinced that Dropbox can continue to attract customers, even as tech giants like Google and Microsoft have freely offered their own online data storage services. Venky Ganesan, a venture capitalist at Menlo Ventures, said a Dropbox I.P.O. would be seen as a harbinger for start-ups. “Will unicorns realize they have to grow up and grow out of their Peter Pan mentality?” he asked, adding that a public offering for Dropbox would also help set the scene for whether other unicorns “reignite and grow, or do they fade away?” Dropbox filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission, affording the company time to make its preparations away from the glare of potential investors. It has hired Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase to help underwrite the initial offering, said the people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Dropbox plans to hire more banks as advisers, they said. The company is aiming to begin trading on a stock market in the spring, one of these people added, cautioning that the timing of an I.P.O. is fluid and may change. The timing will partly depend on the receptiveness of investors who may have been burned by market debuts that later soured. Over all, 2017 proved to be relatively robust for initial offerings, with 160 companies raising $35.6 billion in the United States, up significantly from 2016, according to Renaissance Capital, a research firm. But bankers and analysts said many of the biggest potential market debutantes would likely sit on the sidelines for another year, having already raised enormous sums in the private markets. Representatives for Dropbox, Goldman and JPMorgan declined to comment on the filing, which was reported earlier by Bloomberg News. Founded over a decade ago by Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi when they were students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dropbox was one of the first companies to popularize file storage via the web. The service, which is based in San Francisco, has grown enormously. It claimed some 500 million users in the spring of 2016, the company’s last publicly disclosed figure. Mr. Houston, the company’s chief executive, said last January that Dropbox was on a pace to collect $1 billion in sales on an annualized basis and had positive free cash flow. (It was also profitable if one stripped out interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.) “What Drew and the team have accomplished is something that we are proud of in the tech community and should be proud of as a country,” said Ben Horowitz, a venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz, which has not invested in Dropbox. But Dropbox’s road has also been bumpy. The company’s fast growth was accompanied by free spending and efforts to diversify into other businesses, like a stand-alone photo app, that proved unsuccessful. Mutual fund investors at times marked down the value of their stakes in the company. Since then, Mr. Houston and his management team have focused on containing costs while building out features like collaboration services and shared document creation. One big question that hangs over a potential I.P.O. is what sort of valuation Dropbox would command as a public company. Its closest point of comparison is Box, another Silicon Valley online data storage provider, but one that focuses more on big corporate clients like General Electric and Procter & Gamble. (Dropbox has taken aim at smaller companies, but has argued in the past that it spends less to acquire new customers.) Box trades at about six times its sales for the last 12 months, according to data from Standard & Poor’s Global Market Intelligence, giving it a market capitalization of about $3 billion. It reported having 57 million users as of the quarter that ended Oct. 31, though it has lost money every year since going public three years ago. Dropbox is likely to argue that its bigger user base and greater reliance on word of mouth to gain consumers should mean that it is valued higher than Box.\-0.4047066867351532,-0.21266771852970123,-0.568649411201477,-0.46991652250289917,-0.4742686450481415,-0.48329687118530273,-0.5319128632545471,0.09715038537979126,-1.5561723709106445,-0.9433150291442871,-1.3558958768844604,0.21558663249015808,-1.3083751201629639,-0.23274047672748566,-0.9948481917381287,-0.20549635589122772,-0.1438453197479248,0.3496313691139221,0.8428459167480469,-0.026409216225147247,0.17058692872524261,-0.14341096580028534,0.4978504180908203,-1.1313223838806152,-0.84897381067276,0.7336214184761047,-0.19764859974384308,0.09046711772680283,-0.1321059614419937,-0.5506445169448853,-0.024130959063768387,1.6220300197601318,0.19005230069160461,0.34125253558158875,-0.6164383292198181,0.23696209490299225,0.06189219653606415,0.6793325543403625,1.567907691001892,-0.21097975969314575,0.45472368597984314,0.014292393811047077,1.1133184432983398,-0.4633769989013672,-0.27856114506721497,-1.2429333925247192,0.9215331077575684,-0.5789997577667236,0.27551597356796265,-0.14108331501483917,0.14563778042793274,-0.37579452991485596,-1.2662642002105713,-0.0422443225979805,0.647010862827301,-0.14422117173671722,-0.5144897699356079,0.6232645511627197,-0.1967802345752716,0.5017411708831787,-0.5924597382545471,-1.256949543952942,0.19597460329532623,-0.9231206178665161,-1.359696865081787,0.3359640836715698,1.7455570697784424,1.159533143043518,-0.37696051597595215,0.007012892048805952,0.14312432706356049,0.028011245653033257,-0.7916948795318604,0.15311139822006226,0.9432440400123596,-0.14350302517414093,0.16696888208389282,-0.4457359313964844,-1.020632266998291,-0.4148477017879486,-0.27199506759643555,0.24557551741600037,-0.9714429378509521,1.5974522829055786,0.21127542853355408,0.6778483390808105,-0.5355079770088196,0.5652508735656738,-0.39828774333000183,-1.0635995864868164,-0.365969717502594,-0.2638395130634308,0.004138766787946224,0.47540438175201416,0.20809586346149445,0.9303054213523865,-0.0028302345890551805,0.027894074097275734,-1.5089715719223022,1.287671685218811\NYTIMES\Dropbox Is Said to Be Planning to Go Public This Year\2018-01-12 21:46:40.0\
1746\Politics\KANDEL, Germany — It happened between neatly stacked rows of shampoo and organic baby food: A teenage boy walked up to his ex-girlfriend in the local drugstore, pulled out a kitchen knife with an eight-inch blade and stabbed her in the heart. The death in Kandel, in southwestern Germany, on Dec. 27 has traumatized this sleepy town of barely 10,000 inhabitants, not just because both the suspect and the victim were only 15 years old and went to the local school, but also because the boy is an Afghan migrant and the girl was German. From the moment Germany opened its doors to more than a million migrants two years ago, prominent episodes like the Berlin Christmas market attack and the New Year’s molestation and rapes in Cologne have stoked German insecurities. But the case of the two teenagers, Abdul D. and Mia V., has struck a special nerve because the killing happened in such a quiet and provincial setting and the two people involved were so young. It became national news, was debated over dinner tables, on talk shows and on social media sites, and reinforced fears that Germany is becoming ever less safe. Yet perceptions are one thing, and statistics are another. Reported crimes have edged up over the past two years, but over all, violent crimes have been trending downward for a decade in Germany, which remains one of the safest countries in Europe. Nevertheless, each crime involving a migrant or asylum seeker has become a fresh occasion for national hand-wringing. Something has shifted in Germany. Not so long ago, the logistical challenge and cost of integrating new migrants still dominated the public debate. These days, the growing unease with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s migration policy has reached a new and febrile stage. “I am scared,” said Jana Weigel, a 24-year-old dental assistant, as she lit a candle outside the DM drugstore where the killing took place. Calls have multiplied for mandatory medical exams to determine the age of migrants claiming to be minors and for swifter deportations of those who — like the suspect — have been denied asylum. A preliminary coalition agreement between Ms. Merkel’s conservatives and the more liberal Social Democrats announced on Friday includes a cap of 220,000 refugees per year and strictly limits the number of family members allowed to join a refugee in Germany. Even in proudly tolerant and left-voting Kandel, the mood on the street has hardened. Many here took the killing personally. Before Mia broke up with Abdul, he had been welcomed into her family, Ms. Weigel pointed out, much like the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have been welcomed to Germany. “It makes you think,” she said, “how many others will betray our hospitality.” Ms. Weigel’s sense of insecurity was reinforced by a widely publicized study showing that the number of reported crimes in the state of Lower Saxony had risen by more than 10 percent over the past two years and that the increase could be attributed overwhelmingly to cases involving refugees. Half of that increase is due to the fact that crimes involving migrants are twice as likely to be reported, the authors of the study said. Many of the people accused of crimes are young men under 30, a demographic that is most likely to commit crimes, even among Germans. Less publicized was the other major finding of the report: Over all, violent crime, including murder and rape, remains well below its 2007 peak. The number of young offenders has decreased by half since then. “The paradox is that Germany is still a very safe country, much safer than even a few years ago,” said Christian Pfeiffer, a criminologist and a co-author of the report, which was commissioned by the government and released last week. “But the perception is the opposite: People feel less safe. And when something like this murder happens, it confirms that feeling.” Ask the Germans paying their respects at the ad hoc memorial for the girl who was killed — a sea of candles and messages and photos of her with friends — and they will reel off a list of crimes committed by migrants: a German woman who was raped by a Sudanese migrant in the nearby town of Speyer a few days earlier, another woman who was raped and strangled by an Afghan in Freiburg just over a year ago. Ms. Weigel, who has a 2-year-old daughter, no longer leaves the house after dark. Last month, a terrorist attack was narrowly foiled at an ice rink in Karlsruhe, a 30-minute drive away. “It feels like we’ve lost control,” Ms. Weigel said. “The state has lost control.” Kandel is an orderly town of tastefully restored medieval houses and shops that close for lunch. It is also home to 125 refugees, most of them from Syria or Afghanistan. Until Mia was killed, “there was never a problem,” said Günther Tielebörger, Kandel’s mayor. He represents the Social Democrats, long the strongest party in the town. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, received less than 10 percent of the vote in the last election. Kandel has a long tradition of tolerance. Three centuries ago, it welcomed Huguenot refugees from France. Where other villages in the region built a wall inside their churches to keep Catholics and Protestants apart, Kandel ripped down its wall and shared the church. One of the best restaurants in town serving regional specialties like “pig’s stomach” is run by a Turk. But this tolerance is now being tested. Maja Mathias, 53, works in a local French bakery and has Turkish neighbors and a Croatian brother-in-law. “I have no problem with foreigners,” she said, standing behind a counter featuring freshly baked baguettes and pretzels. “But there is always the fear: What else is coming?” Beyond fear, the killing has stirred other resentments. “German retirees who have worked hard for 45 years get less than the refugees,” said Knoll Pede, 64, a town maintenance worker. He is no fan of President Trump, he said, “but I wouldn’t mind our politicians to do a bit of ‘Germany First.’” Such talk worries Mr. Tielebörger, the mayor. The benefits migrants receive are far less generous than Germans may believe, he said, and many of the migrants are barred from work until their asylum applications have been processed. But the optics matter. “Germans feel neglected,” Mr. Tielebörger said. “We need to wake up,” he said. Otherwise, he added, the left will lose votes to the right. One of Mr. Tielebörger’s former colleagues in local government is Heiko Wildberg, a former member of the liberal pro-immigration Greens party. Mr. Wildberg is now a lawmaker for the nationalist AfD in Berlin. For him, Mia’s killing was a “turning point.” “This is not Berlin or Cologne; we are in small-town Germany,” he said. “This murder shows that the reality of the migrant crisis has arrived in the German province.” The AfD was quick off the mark, organizing a silent march through Kandel two days after the killing. The more extremist National Party of Germany followed suit. Meanwhile, the local benefits office in Kandel had to barricade its doors because its employees had received so many threats. “Accomplices,” anonymous messages called them. Some here accuse the authorities of not doing enough to protect Mia. Abdul had stalked her online and in person and beaten up one of her classmates in a fit of jealousy. On Dec. 15, her parents had reported him to the police. Twelve days later, as she was shopping with friends, he stabbed her repeatedly with a knife he had bought in a supermarket next door. She later died of her wounds. After her father told the German tabloid Bild that her ex-boyfriend “was definitely not 15,” demands for medical exams to verify the claims of refugees who say they are minors have been revived. The ethics commission of the body representing Germany’s doctors has said that such tests — which include X-rays of hand, collar and jaw bones as well as genital exams — violate “bodily integrity” and can be inaccurate by up to two years. They have nonetheless become a rallying cry at the highest level of politics. “In all cases, where no official and real document is presented, we need to determine the age in another way, if needed through medical examinations,” said the conservative interior minister, Thomas de Maizière. When Abdul arrived in Germany in April 2016, he said he was 14, and apparently none of the officials registering him raised serious doubts about his age. As part of the court case against him, a series of medical exams will now seek to confirm his age. Austria, Sweden and the German state of Saarland are among the places conducting such exams regularly. There is an incentive for migrants to be listed as under 18. Government benefits, access to German lessons and job opportunities are better for minors. In Saarland, more than a third of the migrants who were tested appeared to be over 18. Most of the unaccompanied-minor migrants are integrating well, said Anne Spiegel, the integration minister for the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, which includes Kandel. “They are attending school, learning German and signing up for apprenticeships,” she said. Still, officials like Mr. Tielebörger, the mayor, say that every transgression by a migrant gets disproportionate attention, leading to the opposite impression. There was another shocking homicide in Kandel in recent weeks, he pointed out. A man killed his wife and two children. That one did not make the national news. “If the boy had been German,” Mr. Tielebörger said, “we wouldn’t be having this conversation.”\1.6768449544906616,-0.15528181195259094,-2.224900960922241,-0.29572999477386475,-0.6660801768302917,0.6845483779907227,0.6123056411743164,-1.3043102025985718,-1.520708441734314,-0.6894140243530273,1.3873494863510132,0.5253045558929443,0.33505672216415405,-0.03316375985741615,-0.9591481685638428,0.44571229815483093,1.0536994934082031,0.8585628867149353,-0.361301064491272,-1.390223503112793,1.6164857149124146,0.44287070631980896,-0.803318977355957,0.07703202962875366,-1.0961765050888062,1.4857306480407715,-0.0832923948764801,0.1383211612701416,-0.0968702957034111,0.6859440803527832,1.5550038814544678,-0.7663047909736633,0.5994506478309631,0.6788172125816345,-1.0263584852218628,-0.07911502569913864,0.7057945728302002,0.006190843414515257,1.524444341659546,-1.1791573762893677,-0.01494747307151556,-2.259077548980713,0.383899062871933,-0.745476484298706,-0.11702364683151245,0.8011197447776794,2.3164350986480713,0.2070860117673874,-1.4111100435256958,-2.294480085372925,0.9090654253959656,-0.58760005235672,-0.496619313955307,0.334043025970459,1.6238867044448853,-0.37167200446128845,2.541638135910034,0.41384458541870117,-1.4558544158935547,0.4292201101779938,-1.1204777956008911,-0.2587816119194031,-0.3422243297100067,1.0105453729629517,-0.5839758515357971,0.22403866052627563,1.612288236618042,1.1976851224899292,-1.0471305847167969,2.287706136703491,0.8320814371109009,0.2428845763206482,-0.06985854357481003,1.2134212255477905,-1.7911765575408936,0.20502804219722748,1.0785967111587524,-0.13035723567008972,-0.7146627902984619,-2.1516802310943604,0.8118031620979309,0.6980757713317871,-1.7988663911819458,0.7658248543739319,0.8956812620162964,-1.9827399253845215,1.1105482578277588,1.951512336730957,0.6537255644798279,0.884963870048523,-0.048497579991817474,1.1713801622390747,-3.1700615882873535,0.47072604298591614,0.04818907007575035,0.15332254767417908,0.17442527413368225,-1.5853939056396484,-1.0721383094787598,0.4907396137714386\NYTIMES\A Girl’s Killing Puts Germany’s Migration Policy on Trial\2018-01-18 07:37:39.0\
1747\Politics\NEW DELHI — India tested a long-range ballistic missile capable of carrying nuclear weapons on Thursday, paving the way for membership to a small list of countries with access to intercontinental missiles and putting most of China in its reach. The ballistic missile, called Agni 5, was launched from Abdul Kalam Island, off Odisha State in eastern India on Thursday morning, traveling for around 19 minutes and 3,000 miles. In a statement, the Indian Ministry of Defense said that all objectives of the mission had been “successfully met.” The firing of the Agni-5 comes months after the official end of a standoff between China and India over a remote sliver of land in the Himalayas, a squabble that lasted for more than two months and that was one of the worst border disputes between the countries in 30 years. The launch also comes during a tense period in India’s troubled relationship with Pakistan, its nuclear-armed neighbor. Nitin A. Gokhale, an independent national security analyst in New Delhi, said India did not previously have a missile capable of hitting “high-value targets” in China. But Thursday’s successful launch of the Agni 5 has changed the calculus, he said, putting most of China, including major eastern coastal cities such as Shanghai, in reach. “If there are hostilities, and if there are contingencies, then India has something which can deter China or at least make China think twice,” he said. The Agni 5 — Agni means fire in Hindi — is about 55 feet long and was developed in India. It is the most advanced missile in the Agni series, with a strike range of more than 3,000 miles and a payload of 1.5 tons, which is enough to transport a fusion-boosted fission weapon, a type of nuclear device. Coming after four previous tests, Thursday’s firing of the Agni 5 took India closer to incorporating the missile into its Strategic Forces Command, which oversees the country’s nuclear weapons stockpile. Once that induction process is complete, India will join an elite group of countries with access to intercontinental ballistic missiles, a list that includes China, Russia and the United States, experts say. China has criticized India’s development of the Agni 5 in the past. After an early test of the missile, Du Wenlong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Military Science, told the Global Times that the Agni 5 had a strike range of about 5,000 miles, rather than 3,000 miles. He said the Indian government had deliberately played down its range “to avoid causing concern to other countries.” Indian politicians and defense analysts said they were elated by the missile test, with the country’s president, Ram Nath Kovind, writing on Twitter that the test-firing “makes every Indian proud” and “will boost our strategic defense.” The Indian National Congress party said the launch was “the culmination of a multi-decade effort” started by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to shore up the country’s arsenal of missiles. Saurav Jha, the editor in chief of the Delhi Defense Review, wrote in an editorial that the development of the Agni 5 “marks the arrival of India as a missile power.”\2.0692028999328613,0.5238544940948486,-0.06146359443664551,1.360670804977417,0.1519274264574051,-0.959997832775116,2.067317247390747,-0.392742395401001,-1.1226640939712524,-1.0096598863601685,-0.057863906025886536,-0.3074380159378052,-0.009297597222030163,0.14950966835021973,0.4074203670024872,0.6476469039916992,-1.0373326539993286,0.3220483660697937,0.09771434962749481,-0.45670637488365173,0.19957534968852997,-0.4744280278682709,0.34675782918930054,-0.0866612121462822,-0.13920341432094574,0.20180872082710266,-0.3130452334880829,1.585959553718567,0.12467126548290253,0.6502435803413391,-0.8920341730117798,0.04433388635516167,-0.49035993218421936,-1.3447283506393433,-0.848281979560852,-1.044817566871643,0.9329004883766174,-0.9747563600540161,0.07093202322721481,0.3677920997142792,-0.8020654916763306,-0.15660539269447327,0.5252801775932312,-0.14068397879600525,0.4726564884185791,0.8425098657608032,0.022781917825341225,0.46592479944229126,-0.9829909205436707,-0.569194495677948,-0.2512037754058838,-0.001004564925096929,0.3137125074863434,0.4237808287143707,0.5677981972694397,-0.8028011322021484,1.0294564962387085,0.0017629670910537243,-1.2178455591201782,0.06934025883674622,0.8456375002861023,0.2114437073469162,0.7866923213005066,-0.03452182561159134,-1.2595020532608032,-0.41263699531555176,-0.246071919798851,0.9687305092811584,0.19494915008544922,0.42047038674354553,0.3251761198043823,-0.39133840799331665,-0.03634822368621826,0.2346680760383606,-0.5855912566184998,-1.1494745016098022,0.02081502228975296,-0.3152570128440857,-1.513310432434082,-1.3630088567733765,0.02197214402258396,-0.2207016944885254,-1.5625710487365723,-0.07533378154039383,1.8561530113220215,0.19214563071727753,0.7236912250518799,0.18306733667850494,0.8485857248306274,0.8929704427719116,-1.2392922639846802,0.28609201312065125,0.5032157897949219,0.6799700856208801,0.44103381037712097,-0.7861800193786621,-0.550455629825592,-1.2960436344146729,-0.9164474606513977,0.6598541736602783\NYTIMES\India Tests Ballistic Missile, Posing New Threat to China\2018-01-18 14:16:39.0\
1748\Politics\SEOUL, South Korea — North and South Korea reached an agreement Wednesday for their athletes to march together under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics next month, a powerful gesture of reconciliation that further complicates President Trump’s strategy for dealing with the nuclear-armed regime of Kim Jong-un. South Korea, the host of the games, said it hoped a partnership in sports could contribute to a political thaw after years of high tensions on the Korean Peninsula. It came even as the prospect of war over the North’s nuclear and ballistic missile tests has loomed large. For the White House, however, the budding détente scrambles its strategy of pressuring the North, with sanctions and threats of military action, to give up its nuclear arsenal. This latest gesture of unity, the most dramatic in a decade, could add to fears in Washington that Pyongyang is making progress on a more far-reaching agenda. White House officials warn that the ultimate goal of Mr. Kim is to evict American troops from the Korean Peninsula and to reunify the two Koreas under a single flag. They have cited that long-held goal to buttress their argument that Mr. Kim cannot be deterred peacefully as the Soviet Union was during the Cold War. While a onetime Olympics ceremony is hardly a step toward reunification, the image of athletes marching behind a “unified Korea” flag is a symbolic manifestation of what worries Mr. Trump’s aides. And the prospect of crowds from North and South Korea cheering together would be a striking contrast to the threats of war from Mr. Trump. The White House this week welcomed the announcement but played down its significance, noting that it was not the first time that athletes from the two Koreas had competed together. “Let’s hope that the experience gives the North Korean athletes a small taste of freedom and that it rubs off,” said Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council. “North Korean propaganda is in a category all its own,” he added. “It is not surprising that North Korea is sending more cheerleaders and musicians than athletes.” That emphasis on propaganda, other officials said, was in keeping with North Korea’s longer-term goal of reunification. In addition to marching together, the two Koreas will field a joint women’s hockey team at the Games, which begin on Feb. 9 in Pyeongchang. It will be the first time the two countries have combined for an Olympics, and the first unified team of any kind since their athletes played together in a table tennis championship and a youth soccer tournament in 1991. The Olympic agreement could bolster President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who has been pushing for dialogue with the North. “This will be a great opportunity to thaw the frozen relations,” he said during a visit to the training camp for South Korean athletes. “If we unify our team with the North’s, it won’t necessarily improve our team’s strength very much,” Mr. Moon said. “It will even require extra efforts to build up teamwork with the North Korean players. But if the two Koreas unify their teams and play a great match together, that itself will be long remembered as a historic moment.” Few expected that the breakthrough in sports diplomacy would lead to a broader relaxation of the decades-old standoff over the North’s nuclear weapon programs. But it provided a welcome reprieve for South Koreans who have grown alarmed and weary over the tensions and relentless talk of war. Mr. Trump has threatened the North with “fire and fury like the world has never seen,” should it put the security of Americans and their allies at risk, while Mr. Kim has called Mr. Trump a lunatic. Despite its wariness, the White House has been careful not to dismiss the talks between the North and the South, provided the two sides stick to issues like security at the Olympics. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he would be open to talks with Mr. Kim himself, though he questioned the value of such a meeting. “I’d sit down, but I‘m not sure that sitting down will solve the problem,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with Reuters. He warned that while North Korea was not yet capable of delivering a ballistic missile to the United States, “they’re close — and they get closer every day.” In the interview, Mr. Trump was uncharacteristically critical of Russia, saying it had weakened the global sanctions against North Korea, even as China was doing more. “What China is helping us with, Russia is denting,” he said. “In other words, Russia is making up for some of what China is doing.” Analysts said the agreement would be enormously popular in South Korea. Strong ethic nationalism compels people in both Koreas to cheer for each other’s athletes when they compete against non-Korean teams, especially Japan. “We’re at one of these moments where there is this emotional, if not irrational, exuberance at the prospect of North Korean athletes coming south,” said Jonathan D. Pollack, a Korea expert at the Brookings Institution, who is visiting Seoul this week. A previous such moment came in 1991, when a unified and underdog Korean team won the gold medal in the women’s team competition over China in the World Table Tennis Championships in Chiba, Japan. The unified women’s ice hockey team will face Japan on Feb. 14 in Pyeongchang. The problem, Mr. Pollack said, is that North Korea “has put down clear markers about what it wants in return. If the expectation is that North Korea is going to get economic goodies by acting nice, they’re not.” For the United States, the fear has been that North Korea’s gestures will drive a wedge between it and its ally, South Korea. So far, the two allies have stayed in sync, said Daniel R. Russel, who served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs in the Obama administration. “But it will be harder and harder to insure that South Korea and the U.S. stay closely aligned,” he said. “You have a fundamental tension between a progressive government in Seoul and a hawkish government in Washington.” Mr. Moon proposed in June that the two Koreas form a unified team for the Olympics, but the suggestion was not taken seriously until Mr. Kim used his New Year’s Day speech to propose dialogue with the South and to discuss his country’s participation in the Games. That led to a series of talks in the border village of Panmunjom. In an earlier round of negotiations, the North agreed to send a 140-member orchestra to play during the Olympics. On Wednesday, South Korean officials said the North’s delegation would include at least 550 people. The plan is for the North’s athletes to enter the South over a land border on Feb. 1. So far, the only North Korean athletes to qualify for the Games are a pairs figure skating team. North Korea missed an Oct. 31 deadline to accept invitations from South Korea and the International Olympic Committee to join the Games. But the international body has said it remains willing to consider wild-card entries for North Korean athletes. The two Koreas negotiated to share some of the 1988 Seoul Olympics after South Korea won the right to play host to the games. But the talks collapsed, and the North bombed a South Korean passenger jet in 1987 in an attempt to disrupt them.\2.221029758453369,-0.5233878493309021,0.8284266591072083,0.6230916380882263,-1.029753565788269,-0.4768730103969574,1.9731745719909668,0.12659701704978943,0.36594682931900024,-0.6194180250167847,0.8243928551673889,1.9323886632919312,0.7462944984436035,0.5000540018081665,-1.7833243608474731,0.491289883852005,-0.244113489985466,0.14300157129764557,-0.3036745488643646,-0.5492463707923889,0.2644140422344208,0.08257059752941132,-0.7165948152542114,0.7313196063041687,0.47992151975631714,-0.344356507062912,0.9048221707344055,1.7055672407150269,-0.3176804482936859,-0.7684377431869507,0.24664393067359924,0.689907968044281,-0.19342447817325592,-0.1764572411775589,-0.4037817418575287,0.282039999961853,-0.22212940454483032,-0.231505885720253,0.8872937560081482,-0.8979451656341553,-1.1614480018615723,-1.2026090621948242,1.1793590784072876,0.19761121273040771,0.12077302485704422,1.346190094947815,-0.22625763714313507,1.3348110914230347,-0.7696008086204529,-0.4128760099411011,0.09752578288316727,0.919727087020874,1.456862449645996,-0.5534271597862244,1.2598559856414795,-2.3769421577453613,1.9997965097427368,0.8041951060295105,-1.2965182065963745,1.2852627038955688,0.8912577629089355,-0.33929115533828735,0.38546022772789,-1.5114564895629883,-3.3051323890686035,0.7764994502067566,2.5348331928253174,0.40955543518066406,0.10771265625953674,1.1105828285217285,1.3901402950286865,-0.14517956972122192,-0.3550029695034027,0.038949351757764816,-1.8459703922271729,-1.380376935005188,-0.05943653732538223,-0.7368370294570923,-0.7964698076248169,-2.0208160877227783,0.319663941860199,0.11077918857336044,-0.8238823413848877,0.1267995834350586,1.162560224533081,0.027217211201786995,0.7314164042472839,-0.5814464688301086,-0.9342854619026184,0.5205385684967041,-1.4776957035064697,-0.47181418538093567,-2.854898452758789,0.35877126455307007,-0.06172536686062813,0.364440381526947,-1.7495737075805664,-1.3100367784500122,-1.8981964588165283,0.2945781350135803\NYTIMES\Olympic Détente Upends U.S. Strategy on North Korea\2018-01-18 02:29:44.0\
1749\Politics\PRAGUE — With its soaring Gothic cathedrals and ancient alleyways lined with baroque architectural marvels spread beneath a majestic castle that overlooks the city, Prague can seem a place frozen in time. But for more than 600 years, one clock has been measuring the passing hours, noting when day turns to night as well as the position of the sun, moon and stars. Until last week. Prague’s famed Astronomical Clock, the Orloj, in the city’s Old Town, has been stopped for repairs. It is not the first time it has been stopped, but every intervention is fraught, given the clock’s age and fragility. And this one is the most ambitious in years. So for Prague’s clock master, Petr Skala, it is a little like being a surgeon at work on a very old patient. Mr. Skala has until the end of August to complete a major renovation of the Orloj, one of the oldest clocks in the world. When he is done, the engineering marvel that started ticking in 1410 will have been returned to its medieval roots in ways both visible and invisible to the crowds that assemble daily on the square below. In an effort to be true to the original clock master’s design, he will, in effect, have turned back time. Mr. Skala, 71, plans to replace some of the more modern metal gears that turn the intricate machinery of the clock with a wooden system modeled on the original design. On the exterior, the colors on the clock’s face will be tweaked to restore their original shading, and several of the sculptures that adorn the tower will once again represent the best and worst of human traits: pride, envy and avarice paired with compassion, generosity and humility. Evincing the last of those virtues, Mr. Skala said humbly that he was simply working to “remove inappropriate and removable adjustments and return the clock to its original look.” A sculptor by trade, Mr. Skala has long been fascinated by clocks — for both mechanical and romantic reasons. “A clock measures time,” he said. “And time is the most precious gift we are given.” As a child, he said, he would remove the clocks from the walls of his home to take them apart and probe how it was possible to measure the passage of time. “I love history,” he said on Monday after climbing a set of narrow, winding stone steps to reach the tiny nook that houses the guts of the machine in the tower of the city’s old Town Hall. Workers disassembled the timepiece as he spoke, and Mr. Skala later loaded some of the precious cargo into his beat-up old hatchback parked on the street below to be taken to his studio. From the first clock to the Apple Watch, measuring time has been central to human ingenuity. “The whole development of technology is written in the clock,” Mr. Skala said. Perhaps no other clock better demonstrates the genius of the early pioneers of time keeping than the Orloj. Marking the minutes and hours is only one of the many measurements it provides. It tracks Old Bohemian time, when the new day began with sunset; Babylonian time, which tracks the day from sunrise to sunset; Central European time, which is marked with a distinctive hand in the shape of the sun; and Star time, measured by the way the stars appear to move because of the Earth’s rotation. A calendar dial notes the days of the week, month and year, and a zodiacal ring shows the path of the sun and moon through the sky. But it is the astrolabe that is the heart of the clock’s mechanical operation. The apparatus, which tracks the position of the sun, moon and stars, has been an essential tool for astronomers and mariners dating back to antiquity. Mr. Skala, who has been a certified clock master for 25 years, said he was honored when asked to take care of the Orloj eight years ago. He is responsible for several other well-known clocks around the city, including the one at St. Vitus Cathedral at Prague Castle. But none compare to the one at the old Town Hall. “This is where Czech history happened,” he said from the clock tower, pointing to the nearby memorial to John Hus, who was burned at the stake for his beliefs and whose death set off the 15th-century Hussite Wars. “The clock just keeps ticking,” Mr. Skala said. Over the centuries, it has been modified, damaged and repaired — but always returned to fully working order, even after taking a fusillade from German soldiers in World War II. Its longevity has inspired a number of myths surrounding its operation, including at least one that predicts doom: When the clock stops running, the legend goes, the Czech land will be thrown into war and privation. Another legend holds that whoever tries to affect the machine will die or go insane. Asked whether he gave such legends any credence, Mr. Skala smiled. “I cannot believe the stories,” he said, “or else I would never be able to work on the clock.”\2.018387794494629,0.2930848300457001,-0.3611374795436859,-0.18301138281822205,0.2912164330482483,0.74517822265625,0.6659755110740662,0.2816559374332428,-1.3744356632232666,-0.8990606665611267,0.079363152384758,0.8109371066093445,0.6044920086860657,0.6636258363723755,-0.16499216854572296,0.4134926199913025,-1.2423380613327026,1.1868515014648438,-0.5561385750770569,0.12296902388334274,1.1111799478530884,-0.647071123123169,0.7208028435707092,-1.3495742082595825,-0.33268284797668457,0.8057184815406799,1.9587372541427612,1.8488900661468506,-0.1529873013496399,-0.4691259264945984,0.5778136849403381,0.26263365149497986,-0.9411123394966125,0.374919593334198,-0.34758806228637695,-1.0608267784118652,0.6558697819709778,0.3903628885746002,1.3567460775375366,0.05908111110329628,0.5369400978088379,-1.386489748954773,1.1376523971557617,0.6943972706794739,0.4360581338405609,-0.7008827328681946,0.5573976635932922,0.8661494255065918,-1.0375422239303589,-0.2776748239994049,1.4931789636611938,-1.0308890342712402,-0.23570337891578674,0.9454922676086426,0.7661234140396118,0.33007413148880005,1.960801124572754,0.04535474628210068,-0.5829880833625793,2.0771238803863525,-0.25073081254959106,0.15579763054847717,-0.28468266129493713,-0.2131880521774292,-0.1319529116153717,0.3159259855747223,0.06788820028305054,2.6847543716430664,-0.8737190365791321,0.6433875560760498,0.6428219676017761,0.277306467294693,-0.47271302342414856,0.6291455626487732,-1.343072533607483,1.4270808696746826,0.09305179119110107,-0.08984015882015228,-1.511506199836731,-1.9039969444274902,-0.04816930741071701,-1.1059404611587524,-2.3102200031280518,-0.1541787087917328,0.2900540232658386,0.5877048373222351,0.515852153301239,0.4329679310321808,0.8084437251091003,0.6647183895111084,-1.0478368997573853,0.7045202255249023,-1.4558100700378418,-0.5004842281341553,-0.3203040063381195,0.9081920385360718,-0.06014394015073776,-0.02851523831486702,-1.4538708925247192,0.175166517496109\NYTIMES\Prague Journal: One of the World’s Oldest Clocks Stops Ticking, Briefly\2018-01-18 15:25:16.0\
1750\Politics\JERUSALEM — In the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza, Mahmoud Ferwana, 59, huddled beneath a flimsy nylon-and-sheet-metal roof while rain drenched the rest of his squalid home’s sandy floor. He earns money collecting broken stones; his children scavenge for copper. But none of it amounts to a living. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency is what reliably puts food in their mouths. If that aid were to stop, Mr. Ferwana said on Wednesday, “I and my children will die.” That aid, to Mr. Ferwana and more than five million other Palestinians living in refugee camps across the Middle East, is now endangered by what the agency’s leaders are calling the worst financial crisis in its seven-decade history. The United States, its biggest donor, announced this week that it was withholding $65 million from a scheduled payment of $120 million. The Trump administration said it was pressing for unspecified reforms from the agency, while also seeking to get Arab countries to contribute more. In response, the relief agency said on Wednesday that it would begin a fund-raising campaign to try to close the gap before it is forced to cut vital safety-net services. “We’re reaching out to official donors, obviously, but also to the Arab world, to untraditional donors in emerging markets and to individuals, in the hope that we can rapidly upscale the amounts they give to us,” said Chris Gunness, the agency’s chief spokesman. The Trump administration’s move, which added to a deficit of around $150 million on the agency’s budget of nearly $1.25 billion, brought new attention to a sprawling agency that functions as a quasi-government in some areas of the Middle East and has courted controversy throughout most of its history. And it revived politically loaded questions about just who should qualify as refugees — and what is the proper role of the organization charged with caring for them. The agency, known by the acronym Unrwa, was set up in 1949 to aid those who fled or were expelled from their homes during the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. Meant to be temporary, it defined refugees loosely and expanded that definition over time. One key difference between it and the office of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, critics say, is that the agency routinely allows refugee status to be passed down for generations. Another is that it does not remove people from its list who have acquired citizenship in a new country, so the number always increases. Hence the Palestinian refugee population has grown from approximately 700,000 Palestinians who fled the wars in 1948 and 1967 to more than 5.2 million registered refugees, some 1.7 million of them living in Unrwa-administered camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria today. Moreover, rather than working to reduce its rolls by resettling refugees in other countries, the agency has focused on helping refugees where they are until a political end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be reached. “Unrwa would like nothing more than to shut up shop,” Mr. Gunness said. “But there has to first be a just and durable solution.” The Arab states that have taken in the bulk of the refugees ask why they should grant them citizenship instead of helping them to return to their homes in what is now Israel. The agency’s critics in Israel and in the United States say that it has perpetuated the problem by maintaining a steadily growing refugee population, which in turn means more refugees demanding a right of return. “At the rate we’re going now, it’s going to be 15 million soon,” said Asaf Romirowsky, executive director of Scholars for Peace in the Middle East, who has called for disbanding the agency and turning over its functions to other institutions, like the Palestinian Authority. “Unrwa will tell you they’ll leave the situation when there is a resolution to the conflict, but it’s a catch-22: They are the gatekeepers for the one single issue that perpetuates the conflict from generation to generation.” He said that freezing the agency’s money could be a good step if it forced Israel and the Palestinians to the table. “The endgame from a political standpoint has to be about fully ending refugee status and ending the right of return,” he said. “Otherwise, this is just going to come back in a different formulation.” The right of return for the refugees and their descendants has long been a stumbling block in the peace process, with Palestinians insisting on it and Israel objecting to it. Mediators have proposed settling the issue with a payment to the refugees, but such a deal would only be likely to happen as part of a negotiated peace settlement. The brief against Unrwa is lengthy, timeworn and continually debated: that it awards too much of its aid, as in education and health care, based on refugee status, not need; that it often makes pronouncements that are anti-Israel, or, in the case of Gaza, too sympathetic to Hamas, with which it must coexist there; that its schools inculcate hostility to Israel or even breed terrorists. “They hide it behind a very thin facade, that all they care about is social and humanitarian services,” said Einat Wilf, a former Labor member of the Israeli Parliament. “But it’s a Palestinian political organization, devoted to the Palestinian agenda of erasing Israel.” The agency’s defenders say that it is the existence of the refugee population that sticks in the craw of those Israelis who do not want to acknowledge that their country’s creation displaced hundreds of thousands of people, and would prefer to deny the refugee problem or resolve it once and for all. “Naturally, it draws attention to a particular group which is vulnerable,” said Mick Dumper, a politics professor at Exeter University who has studied the agency. “But there isn’t a homeland that refugees can return to,” he added. “Palestine has been replaced by Israel. That means they’re stuck out there. So what do you do? Do you let them starve?” A similar question is being asked by some Israelis. “The perpetuation of Unrwa is not the dream of any peace-loving person in Israel,” said Yossi Beilin, a longtime Israeli politician who helped initiate the Oslo process. “But it really deals with the most important matters — food, health, education, for every family. “Only an ignorant person, like President Trump, who doesn’t understand the whole story, could say, ‘Tomorrow there is no Unrwa,’ because tomorrow, we will have to pay the price — either by violence if it erupts, or because of the need to help them. Who else will do that?” While some critics of the agency imagine refugees being absorbed by Lebanon or Jordan, the two countries have dealt with them in different ways. Palestinians in Jordan are generally better off, as most of the two million registered refugees there have citizenship and can work, do business and seek education. The 450,000 registered Palestinian refugees in Lebanon are generally seen as worse off. Refugees in Lebanon are barred from working in a number of lucrative professions like law, medicine and engineering, as well as from owning land and registering businesses. As a result, most live in camps that have swelled over the decades into crowded slums, where poverty and unemployment are widespread. Very few have been granted Lebanese citizenship for fear that taking in so many Sunni Muslims would upset the country’s delicate sectarian balance. And many Lebanese have long argued that giving them rights and services would lessen the pressure on them to return to what is now Israel. That is one point on which Israeli and its Arab neighbors agree, and it leaves the Palestinians in the middle, pawns in a geopolitical game. Outside a falafel shop at the Shatila camp in Beirut, Fayal al-Ahmad, 61, who works with an affiliate of Unrwa that helps Palestinians from Syria, said that, one way or the other, “We need to get our rights.” “If they’re going to claim we’re not refugees who deserve services, then they either need to begin providing naturalization, or they need to allow us to return to our homeland, to Palestine,” she said. “As the saying goes, ‘The sword has two blades.’”\0.36508414149284363,0.3452211618423462,-0.7203584313392639,-0.4434322416782379,0.4765779674053192,-0.0766899362206459,0.16725103557109833,0.007316477131098509,-0.09116105735301971,-0.3775371015071869,0.9561567902565002,0.5735956430435181,0.054557546973228455,-0.6895973682403564,-0.47884446382522583,0.9187121987342834,-0.13739699125289917,-0.3663122057914734,0.48677539825439453,-0.09830855578184128,0.43804389238357544,-0.37732386589050293,1.3496637344360352,-0.6272416114807129,0.4856035113334656,1.169569969177246,0.4182640314102173,0.4716416001319885,-0.450324684381485,0.5056205987930298,0.05189267545938492,0.8931060433387756,1.1126835346221924,-0.7591140866279602,-0.02861696667969227,-0.7299736142158508,-0.2580452561378479,-1.0192742347717285,1.0208491086959839,-0.9244194030761719,-0.9185957908630371,-1.4178467988967896,0.5309869050979614,-1.0334209203720093,-0.47114595770835876,0.5280874371528625,0.022381234914064407,0.8622352480888367,-1.0256054401397705,-0.14472362399101257,1.6455475091934204,-1.4489185810089111,-0.7130672931671143,-0.7832506895065308,0.8537226319313049,-0.7052314877510071,1.3094515800476074,-0.9968756437301636,-1.4769045114517212,1.4599660634994507,0.0024439936969429255,0.44527485966682434,-0.7239569425582886,-0.7993260622024536,-0.2955267131328583,1.035046935081482,0.8571339249610901,1.5914257764816284,-0.14526808261871338,0.8193261027336121,-0.030668867751955986,0.6220824122428894,-1.6418503522872925,0.4424911439418793,-2.4839043617248535,-1.0436092615127563,0.08771733194589615,0.18639738857746124,-1.0165598392486572,-0.9731364250183105,-0.17502503097057343,-0.6493389010429382,-2.1466610431671143,-0.17699243128299713,-0.5080488920211792,-0.563908040523529,-0.3321384787559509,-0.21796156466007233,1.36459219455719,-0.13014210760593414,-1.8283743858337402,1.3947068452835083,-1.6350136995315552,-0.08953525125980377,0.716932475566864,1.2028264999389648,0.08489521592855453,-0.873042106628418,-1.209202527999878,1.7236498594284058\NYTIMES\U.S. Funding Cut Reignites Debate on Palestinian Refugee Agency\2018-01-18 09:51:45.0\
1751\Politics\LIMA, Peru — It was 3 in the morning when Luis Fernando Figari, the leader of a powerful Catholic organization in Peru, summoned Oscar Osterling and two other young men in their 20s to a room with him. He had made unusual requests before, under the guise of “spiritual guidance,” but not this: Mr. Figari, Mr. Osterling says, told the men to undress as he pulled out a video camera and started recording. “If someone asked you to do something, you simply did it,” says Mr. Osterling, now 44, recalling that night in 1991. “Some 20 years later, I realized that lots of people were asked to undress.” Prosecutors in Peru say that Mr. Figari orchestrated the sexual and physical abuse of young men over many years through his organization. But in 2015, when they began a criminal investigation, he left for Rome. A Peruvian judge is now set to rule on whether to authorize his arrest, which would allow prosecutors to seek his extradition. Mr. Figari has denied the allegations. Last year, after conducting its own inquiry, the Vatican told Mr. Figari not to return to Peru, Vatican documents show. It also ordered his all-male organization, Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, to foot the bill for his living expenses, the documents, released by Sodalitium, show. On Wednesday, a Vatican spokesman, Greg Burke, said in a statement: “The directive not to return to Peru was issued in order to block any contact of Figari with Sodalitium. The Vatican will in no way oppose Peruvian efforts to detain Figari.” The scandal has nonetheless cast a pall over Pope Francis’ arrival in Peru on Thursday. Francis offered an apology to sexual abuse victims this week in Chile, but many Peruvians are asking: If the pope wants to be tough on such crimes, how could the Vatican protect one of its alleged perpetrators? “That’s how the church operates, they bring their own ‘home’ as it were, and then there are no consequences,” said Peter Saunders, an abuse survivor who was suspended in 2016 from a commission that Francis announced in 2013, to much fanfare, to establish guidelines for sex-abuse cases. Mr. Saunders resigned from the commission last month. Mr. Figari, a layman, stepped down as the leader of Sodalitium in 2010, but he remains a member of the group. It was one of several communities in Latin America — like the Rev. Fernando Karadima’s El Bosque in Chile — allegedly headed by abusive leaders who experts say operated with impunity because the Vatican, under Pope John Paul II, ignored reports of problems. His successors have been accused of moving too slowly to address the issue. Last week, before his trip to Latin America, Francis ordered a Vatican takeover of Sodalitium, saying he had concerns about its management and finances. But his announcement did not explicitly address victims or abuses. “This announced intervention does not take care of us, the victims,” said a former member, who said that when he was 15, Mr. Figari had anal sex with him several times. The Vatican did not respond to a request for comment. But Sodalitium, which commissioned its own investigation in 2016, has laid out chilling details of abuse in a report that it released. The report says that Mr. Figari and other members sexually abused at least 19 minors and 17 adults starting in 1975. The report said Mr. Figari had engaged in “multiple acts of sodomy of a minor male,” instructed a man to kiss his penis and touched and hugged members while naked. Mr. Figari also knew of three adult members who sexually abused minors, the report said. “Figari told some of his victims the indecent acts were part of his mystical powers, yoga exercises, or an energy generating technique,” Sodalitium investigators found. Peruvian prosecutors say too much time has elapsed to bring sex-crime charges. Instead, they say Mr. Figari ran a “criminal organization” that preyed on young men, and have asked a judge to approve his arrest. That would allow them to seek his extradition. In October 2016, Mr. Figari, who is now 70, said he was “not aware that there are any victims.” The Vatican later barred him from speaking to the press, the Vatican documents show. Armando Lengua Balbi, a lawyer for Mr. Figari, said his client denied the allegations. He said that Mr. Figari was undergoing cancer treatment and that he was “exercising his right to resist” the Peruvian authorities. “If he comes back, people will lynch him,” Mr. Lengua Balbi said. He said the encounter with Mr. Osterling might not even be considered abuse at all. “This could lead you to think, ‘Well, this man is weird, this is wrong, I shouldn’t have acquiesced, I should have pushed back,’” Mr. Lengua Balbi said. “But to accuse someone under the label of a sexual crime or sexual abuse? Asking someone to drop their pants is not a crime. That’s not a crime anywhere in the world.” He also said the accusations involving the 15-year-old would be impossible to prove in court. “He should have gotten medically examined,” Mr. Lengua Balbi said. Mr. Figari was known to his followers as a foul-mouthed, larger-than-life figure. He founded Sodalitium in the early 1970s on deeply conservative values and the promise of a life of obedience. One of the group’s principles said that “an independent spirit means the death of our community.” Another said “the only thing a Sodalite cannot do is give birth.” Members occasionally sang “Facing the Sun,” the anthem of the Spanish Falange, a fascist party, recalled Pedro Salinas, a member during the 1980s who in 2015 wrote a book with the journalist Paola Ugaz about the organization. Like Mr. Figari, most members are laymen, but they live together in monastery-like community houses. The group gained a foothold among well-heeled Peruvian families, spreading through Latin America and even to an outpost in Denver. When Francis was still a cardinal, he invited Sodalitium to set up a community in Argentina. Members recall that during Mr. Figari’s heyday, Sodalitium focused on discipline and obedience. Recruits were young, usually 14 to 16. “When you lived in community, you couldn’t go out on the streets if you didn’t have permission from a superior,” said Martin Scheuch, who was a member for 15 years. Mr. Osterling, who left Sodalitium in 2011, recalls being asked to send Mr. Figari photos and videos of young men who were potential recruits saluting him. “Figari supposedly would review the film, look into the kids’ eyes and was able to see their souls,” he said. Mr. Figari would then choose which boys to invite to Sodalitium retreats, where he would send them cryptic messages. “I’ve heard much about you,” he might say, according to a legal complaint filed with prosecutors by former members of the group. Obedience and abuse were often intertwined. Mr. Scheuch recalled a night when Mr. Figari suddenly told him to put his hands and knees on the floor and lift up his shirt. “No one could tell him, ‘I’m not going to do that,’” Mr. Scheuch said. “That was unthinkable. So I did it, and he called another Sodalite to start whipping my bare back. The Sodalite doubted, so Mr. Figari repeated his order and he whipped me with his belt.” Mr. Salinas recalled Mr. Figari once came in with a prospective applicant and made a strange request. He asked for a candle and matches, then asked Mr. Salinas to pull up his sleeve and extend his arm. Mr. Figari proceeded to burn him, he said. “I had my poker face on because I understood implicitly that the point was to impress the prospective applicant,” Mr. Salinas said. “I ended up with a big red blister and a bandaged arm for a few days.” At least 18 people were victims of physical abuse, according to the group’s report. Mr. Figari served as Sodalitium’s superior general until his resignation in 2010. Sodalitium’s internal investigation found that he had left over the abuse revelations. Victims say it took far too long for the allegations to come to light, and say that in many cases their accounts were not believed. “I’ve given my testimony to countless people in search of justice since 1978,” said the man who accused Mr. Figari of sexually abusing him as a teenager. He asked not to be named. In May 2011, the man filed a complaint with Peru’s ecclesiastical court that was forwarded to the Vatican. More complaints were filed in 2013 and 2014, according to Sodalitium’s internal investigation. The Vatican finally acted in April 2015, sending a Peruvian bishop to investigate. But it was not until six months later that Sodalitium publicly confronted Mr. Figari, when Mr. Salinas and Ms. Ugaz published their book. By then, Mr. Figari had left the country. In January 2017, the Vatican investigators concluded that Mr. Figari had engaged in sexual activity “with some young men,” at least one of whom was under 16, who were being trained by the group. Still, the documents say, the allegations contained “inconsistent timelines, contradictions and some aspects were not very clear.” And it said that investigators were “perplexed by the notable, anomalous and not entirely comprehensive echo” the abuse allegations had generated in Peru. Mr. Lengua Balbi said Mr. Figari was appealing the ruling, and had hired two canon lawyers. The man who says Mr. Figari abused him when he was 15 said the Vatican’s investigation was a whitewash. “The church has never contacted me,” he said. “Never.”\1.6187498569488525,0.38179802894592285,-0.8298122882843018,1.571399211883545,0.03750872611999512,0.54893958568573,1.21271812915802,-0.42556214332580566,-1.0984748601913452,-0.5690953731536865,0.20023174583911896,0.048664242029190063,-0.705975353717804,1.226342797279358,-0.6206725239753723,-0.2936021089553833,1.0597050189971924,-0.2147572934627533,0.7977657318115234,-0.23563548922538757,1.4977474212646484,-0.3768951892852783,-0.918549656867981,-0.17906183004379272,-1.4862264394760132,0.2870391011238098,1.9463104009628296,0.5664567947387695,-0.7933772206306458,-1.4685554504394531,0.5676797032356262,1.2751734256744385,-0.2031889110803604,0.4031674563884735,-0.6409568786621094,-0.9442563056945801,-0.37042248249053955,1.581692099571228,0.22634179890155792,-1.7807587385177612,-0.7307895421981812,-1.3419162034988403,1.0716309547424316,-0.8471055626869202,0.4100585877895355,-0.5615264773368835,1.0635325908660889,1.0482134819030762,-1.9533827304840088,-0.07399372011423111,1.3600621223449707,-1.3090041875839233,0.5750257968902588,-0.7004930377006531,1.45864737033844,0.20222754776477814,1.945116639137268,1.7355971336364746,-1.3994507789611816,2.010348320007324,-0.7925179600715637,1.292231559753418,-0.08204562216997147,-0.058763984590768814,0.3263426423072815,-0.5971095561981201,0.24418842792510986,1.9002896547317505,-1.8380545377731323,0.694098949432373,0.5552131533622742,-1.3596774339675903,-1.3452749252319336,1.728245496749878,-1.3843828439712524,1.081262469291687,1.3653078079223633,0.16436293721199036,-1.0829535722732544,-1.124440312385559,2.047114133834839,-1.4817099571228027,-1.3501482009887695,-1.1441601514816284,0.6515925526618958,0.21745231747627258,0.6175076365470886,0.9166029691696167,-0.4282248318195343,1.2977689504623413,-0.4055193364620209,0.3265991806983948,-2.587956190109253,0.5007635951042175,-1.454803228378296,-0.5115280747413635,-0.3927572965621948,-2.065117120742798,-1.4354171752929688,0.3710606098175049\NYTIMES\Sex Abuse Case Shadows Pope Francis’ Visit to Peru\2018-01-18 09:03:24.0\1751, 1776
1752\Politics\ALMATY — A bus fire in northwestern Kazakhstan killed 52 Uzbek citizens on a route used by migrant workers heading to Russia, the Kazakh Interior Ministry said on Thursday. The bus was traveling along a road in the remote Aktobe region that links the Russian city of Samara to Shymkent, a city in southern Kazakhstan close to the Uzbek border. The bus was traveling from southern Kazakhstan to Russia's Kazan, Kazakh officials said. The route is widely used to transport Uzbek workers to and from Russia where they often take work on building sites. Only five people managed to escape the burning vehicle, the interior ministry's emergencies department said in a statement. The ministry said the apparent accident had happened at 10.30 a.m. (0430 GMT), but provided no details about its cause. It said senior government officials would investigate the matter. A photograph posted online from the site showed the bus completely burnt out. Video footage also posted on the Web showed it positioned diagonally across a two-lane freeway in the middle of a snow-covered steppe, in flames and emitting heavy black smoke. Uzbekistan's foreign ministry said in a statement its embassy staff were en route to the area, roughly midway between the Russian border and the Aral Sea. Separately, Uzbekistan's Emergencies Ministry said it was sending a plane with its own team of doctors and rescuers to the site. Last October, another Kazakh-operated bus carrying over 50 Uzbeks was hit by a train in Russia after getting stuck on the tracks; 17 people died in that accident.

1753\Politics\WASHINGTON — Face to face with a former C.I.A. officer in 2013, federal agents took a calculated risk. They did not confront him about the classified information they had found in his luggage. And they did not ask what they most wanted to know: whether he was a spy for China. It was a life-or-death call. The Chinese government had been systematically picking off American spies in China, dismantling a network that had taken the C.I.A. years to build. A mole hunt was underway, and the former officer, Jerry Chun Shing Lee, was the prime suspect. The F.B.I. could have arrested him on the spot for possessing classified information. But inside a secretive government task force, investigators argued against it, former American officials recalled. If Mr. Lee was a turncoat, arresting him on an unrelated charge would tip off the Chinese and allow them to cover their tracks. If he was not the mole — and some argued strenuously that he was not — an arrest might allow the real traitor to escape. So the F.B.I. allowed Mr. Lee to return to Hong Kong, court papers show, where he hastily resettled with his family. The agents, working out of an office in Northern Virginia, gambled that by watching patiently, they might piece together how China had decimated the United States’ spy network, and determine whether Mr. Lee had helped. Nearly five years later, when Mr. Lee made a surprise return to the United States this week, the F.B.I. made its move. He stepped off a Cathay Pacific flight at Kennedy International Airport on Monday and was waved through customs. A waiting F.B.I. agent, Kellie O’Brien, called out his name, according to court records. Mr. Lee answered, and was arrested. His apprehension, on the same single charge that could have been brought years ago, is the latest development in one of the most damaging affairs in modern C.I.A. history. But it does nothing to settle the question of how or whether Mr. Lee was involved. For years, he was the prime suspect in a mole hunt, but officials disagreed over whether he was actually to blame. One government official said there was no plan at the moment to charge Mr. Lee with espionage, handing over American secrets to the Chinese or anything beyond the one felony count of illegally possessing classified information. That would leave open the mystery of how China managed to unravel the C.I.A.’s web of informants. Neither the F.B.I. nor the Justice Department would discuss this high-stakes back story on Wednesday. “This is an example of the system working,” said Ian Prior, a Justice Department spokesman. “The defendant arrived in this country, we apprehended him and he has been charged with an extremely serious offense.” In an email, Mr. Lee’s college-age daughter declined to discuss the case and said that no lawyer or family member was available to speak on his behalf. The New York Times revealed the decimation of the C.I.A.’s network last year, citing 10 current and former government officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation. Several of them identified Mr. Lee as the key suspect at the time. Mr. Lee, 53, took an unremarkable path through the C.I.A. He became a United States citizen and, after four years in the Army, studied international business management at Hawaii Pacific University. He graduated in 1992 and received a master’s degree in human resource management the next year. From there, he joined the C.I.A., posing as an American diplomat while serving as a clandestine case officer. From old address records, he appears to have served in Tokyo from about 1999 to 2002. Officials say he also worked at the East Asia Division at C.I.A. Headquarters and the agency’s Beijing station before he left in 2007 and took a job in Hong Kong. When the C.I.A. noticed in late 2010 that its spies were disappearing, suspicion did not immediately turn to Mr. Lee, according to current and former officials. But as fears of a mole grew, the government set up a secret task force of C.I.A. officers and F.B.I. agents. A veteran F.B.I. counterintelligence agent, Charles McGonigal, was assigned to run it, former American law enforcement officials said. As the disappearances continued, analysts concluded that Mr. Lee, even though he had been out of the C.I.A. for years, had known the identities of many of the those who had been killed or imprisoned. He showed all the indicators on a government matrix used to identify potential espionage threats, one former official recalled. But warning signs can be wrong. At the C.I.A., top officials ruefully remembered the treatment of Brian J. Kelly, an agency officer who in the 1990s was wrongly suspected by the F.B.I. of being a Russian spy. More recently, the Justice Department’s efforts to unearth Chinese spies have suffered embarrassing setbacks, including dropped charges against prominent Chinese-Americans. In Mr. Lee’s case, other possible explanations existed. Some investigators believed that China had cracked the C.I.A.’s system for communicating with its informants. The spy agency had encountered similar problems in other countries, and some investigators believed the technology was too clunky to stand up to China’s sophisticated computer specialists. Another group accused C.I.A. officials in Beijing of being sloppy and allowing themselves to be identified when meeting with their informants. It was an acrimonious dispute, and some officials conceded that a combination of factors could account for the damage. Some former officials who reviewed the evidence described the case against Mr. Lee as strong but circumstantial, not bulletproof. Some at the C.I.A. argued that officials were too quick to suspect a mole — especially a Chinese-American — when there were other explanations. The F.B.I. was watching in August 2012 when Mr. Lee returned to the United States with his family. Agents secretly entered his hotel rooms in Hawaii and Virginia and discovered two small books with handwritten notes that contained classified information, including the identities of undercover C.I.A. officials, court papers show. The information the books contained, including details about meetings between C.I.A. informants and undercover agents, as well as their real names and phone numbers, matched documents that Mr. Lee had written while at the C.I.A., according to court documents. It was not clear whether any of the people identified in his documents were part of the Chinese roundup of C.I.A. sources. Agents spoke with him repeatedly in the following months. Both the attorney general at the time, Eric H. Holder Jr., and Robert S. Mueller III, then the F.B.I. director, were personally briefed on the investigation and pledged whatever resources were necessary. But senior government officials said they cannot recall any serious push to arrest Mr. Lee at the time or to try to charge him with espionage in connection with the lost Chinese informants. So in June 2013, the agents let Mr. Lee leave. Current and former officials have said that the C.I.A.’s losses had ended by late 2012, so there is no evidence that the decision allowed more informants to be captured or killed. At least once in recent years, according to a government official, Mr. Lee returned to the United States without attracting the F.B.I.’s attention. It was not clear how or why he did so. At some point the Justice Department decided that if it had the chance, it would charge Mr. Lee. Officials suspected that opportunity might come later this year when Mr. Lee’s daughter graduated from college, an occasion that might draw him back to the United States.

1754\Politics\ROME — For most visitors to Rome, the city gets high marks for its monuments, food, temperate climate and laid-back lifestyle — the dolce vita. But Roman cabbies often get a failing grade. Social media is rife with cautionary tales of ripoffs and swindles, often involving scenic — but unsolicited — drives past Rome’s historic sights or taxi meters that spin faster than they probably should. It hasn’t been the best calling card for the Italian capital, especially as cabbies are often the first locals tourists interact with. Which is why on a recent morning a few dozen cabdrivers found themselves in a nondescript hotel room taking a crash course in “courtesy, hospitality, language and excellence.” The six-week course aims to improve how taxi drivers deal with foreign customers, including how to dispense basic information in a variety of languages. “Maybe it’s asking too much that they know art history in detail,” said Maria Cristina Selloni, the director of the municipal tourism department, which developed the curriculum. “But a few anecdotes would be welcome, as well as advice on what shows or exhibits visitors should see. Plus a smattering of conversation.” Around 750 of Rome’s 6,000 taxi drivers have signed up to take the course, which also explores the complexities of cultural differences and the basics of common courtesy. The city tourism department has tailored similar courses for hotel staffs and private hospitality enterprises like Airbnb. Ms. Selloni said the demand for hospitality training had become urgent in recent years with a significant increase in tourists from China and the Middle East. Hence the course offers an overview of social norms in various cultures, including national proxemics (the amount of expected personal space), nonverbal communication and potentially offensive hand gestures. “Someone has to tell the poor taxi driver that you can’t be the first to offer your hand to an Arab woman or touch a Chinese person’s luggage unless they say so,” said Ms. Selloni, who noted that the European Union had designated 2018 the “E.U.-China Tourism Year,” and that many Asian visitors to Rome were expected. About half of the course is devoted to languages, mostly English — a smattering of phrases like “Have a nice day,” “traffic jam” and “Please don’t smoke in the taxi” (which could apply to drivers themselves, it was pointed out) — but also Arabic and Mandarin. “How do you say 48 in Chinese?” — the price in euros of a ride from Rome’s city center to the airport — one cabby asked Haohao Zheng, a teacher who had the class in conniptions trying to get them to pronounce “xie xie” (thank you), explaining that the sound was similar to that made “by old women without any teeth.” Ms. Zheng’s lessons also delved into Chinese geography, history, traditions, travel requirements and cultural faux pas, including some tips that might not necessarily come in handy on an ordinary ride. (Avoid physical contact. Be careful how you put chopsticks into rice. Avoid talking about politics, though “food and sports are O.K.”) Franco Rossi, a taxi driver and aspiring Chinese speaker, said he appreciated the training. “It’s a pleasure when a tourist finds someone who speaks their language,” he said. “It’s a form of respect.” The language instruction was calibrated to put the drivers at ease. “We Italians are some of the biggest communicators — just think of how we are always using our hands — but when we speak in English we become penguins,” said Marco Cigna, the chief executive of the John Peter Sloan school, which won the tender for the course along with other partners. When it comes to foreign languages, he said, “Italians become completely shy. We have to change that.” Rome is visited by around 14 million tourists each year, and the feedback they share online has a considerable effect on tourism, as Guendalina Iafrate, a tourism expert and program docent, emphasized to the class. “No one returns to a place where they’ve been treated badly, nor will they tell others to go,” she said. “We must start thinking of tourists as guests, someone we give hospitality to,” Ms. Iafrate said, gently addressing complaints logged against cabdrivers. “No one likes the feeling of being ripped off, but there is a notion among some people that tourists are like geese that lay golden eggs,” she said. “You are creators of experience,” she told the class. “Positive word of mouth publicity is what will give work to your kids.” Other teachers emphasized cultural differences: Why some cultures tip. Why some are more touchy-feely. Why some are apt to complain more than others. “We eat horse — that grosses out British people,” said Francesca Marzolini, a tourism expert whose lessons meandered from the historical to the political to the stereotypical. “Some people eat animal placenta; in China they eat dogs.” “We have to understand what is behind other customs,” she said. “At home you can like it or not, but when you work you have to be professional.” Ms. Selloni, the tourism director, said another important objective was to make taxi drivers — who have often come to loggerheads with city officials over contentious issues — feel more a part of the city whose streets they know so well. “It’s always disappointing to ask a cabdriver for information and get a shrug in response,” said Ms. Selloni, whose office plans to give the drivers regular updates on events taking place in Rome. “They are the key to the city.” One driver, Umberto Nucci, said he was glad to have taken the course. “In our work English is fundamental — it allows you to speak to anyone from anywhere, even if it’s only a few words, like ‘Do you like Rome?’ said Mr. Nucci, whose taxi consortium has sponsored other language courses for its members in the past. “It puts a client at ease.” And, he said, “it’s important to make people understand that not every taxi driver is a bandit.”\1.6288236379623413,1.2080775499343872,0.06525135785341263,0.10994062572717667,-0.4191051125526428,0.21554121375083923,1.5213820934295654,-0.6229645013809204,-0.23593935370445251,-0.6885451078414917,1.3671396970748901,1.0156573057174683,-0.8403711915016174,0.9158685803413391,0.6477261185646057,0.020604634657502174,-0.8441275954246521,0.09388483315706253,0.49945709109306335,-0.24337168037891388,0.5894631743431091,0.09988430887460709,0.321817547082901,-1.125031590461731,0.46363332867622375,0.5391608476638794,0.5488749146461487,-0.11989321559667587,-0.8596900105476379,-0.2433367669582367,0.12098986655473709,0.14028863608837128,0.6478652358055115,-0.8017801642417908,-0.4431994557380676,-1.4011085033416748,-0.404354453086853,-0.1615973263978958,0.30208534002304077,0.007942425087094307,-0.4913570284843445,-1.5180448293685913,1.0417447090148926,0.4131324887275696,-0.27359333634376526,0.6984832882881165,0.3573001027107239,0.5045275688171387,-1.6853468418121338,0.09403188526630402,1.3191496133804321,-1.144242286682129,-1.2350006103515625,0.6132000684738159,1.013774037361145,-1.1136928796768188,1.1715165376663208,-0.17636162042617798,-2.1234688758850098,0.5804239511489868,0.09022663533687592,-0.8141852617263794,-0.2950016260147095,-0.6560737490653992,-1.772680401802063,1.0422054529190063,0.9775910377502441,1.8538448810577393,-0.6686761975288391,0.5811923742294312,0.9025325179100037,0.16747233271598816,-0.8556745648384094,0.6828027367591858,-0.8312678337097168,-1.405683994293213,-0.8595069050788879,0.21116474270820618,-0.39116600155830383,-1.4716821908950806,0.3514125943183899,-0.10043830424547195,-3.095883846282959,1.1266366243362427,-0.6993060111999512,0.133602112531662,0.5083246827125549,0.7423270344734192,0.399556964635849,-0.9215896725654602,-1.2574865818023682,0.4384519159793854,-0.6948745250701904,0.886311948299408,0.01008096057921648,0.4476585388183594,0.5810697078704834,-0.17697715759277344,-0.9819238781929016,0.021706843748688698\NYTIMES\Rome Journal: For Rome’s Taxi Drivers, Lessons in Courtesy and Cultural Savvy\2018-01-17 15:20:36.0\

Sign up here. ______ A few newsletters ago, I asked for your help. Could we, together, vanquish Canada? Could we add more new sign-ups to the Australia Letter than my colleague, Ian Austen, could add to his newsletter, the Canada Letter? Since Canada had more than double our subscriber base to pull from, it was an epic challenge. Not quite like trying to reach the third round of the Australian Open when you’re only 15 years old. But sort of. And you did it. Marta Kostyuk became the youngest woman to reach the third round of a Grand Slam in 21 years this week; and as of Thursday night, 1,921 people signed up for the Australia Letter since my plea at the end of November, compared to 1,334 for the Canada Letter. A toast goes to all those who signed up or who helped sign up friends. Thank you. Special thanks also goes to those who supported our effort in Australia by giving the gift of a The New York Times subscription for the holidays. And for those looking to exhibit that famous Aussie competitiveness, Kate Moss is the one to beat. Here’s what she wrote to us in December: Now before some of you get all cross with me for the self-celebratory tone, let me also say this: We’re not yet where we aim to be. The Australia bureau is less than a year old and we still have a lot to learn about how to make sure we’re telling the stories — and sharing the stories beyond this continent — that will add value to your routine. As always, we’re eager to hear from you. If you have a story tip, an investigative lead, or an anecdote for our Australia Diary, email us at nytaustralia@nytimes.com. We’re also pushing forward with brainstorming of our own. I just got back from an annual meeting of New York Times correspondents in the Asia-Pacific region. For three days in Hong Kong, dozens of New York Times journalists huddled together to talk about coverage for the coming year. We discussed how China is changing under Xi Jinping, what “the China model” actually is, and how it is influencing the world at a time of American retreat. We discussed the direction of India and Myanmar. We discussed religion and democracy. We talked about suicide in Japan, protests in Iran, how technology is being used to reshape interaction for us all. We also ate some amazing food. (Peking duck. Lots of it, among other things.) And of course, we talked about Australia and New Zealand. Interest in this part of the world seems to be growing. As a result, you can expect more visitors this year and a wider range of coverage. Truly, The New York Times here and everywhere is an evolving effort. We’re eager to do great work, and eager to engage our (and your) collective curiosity. So let’s get to it. Here’s this week’s roundup of stories, plus a recommendation for what to listen to while you enjoy the summer heat. See you on Twitter and in our NYT Australia Facebook group! ______ A former CIA agent was arrested and charged with helping the Chinese government identify informants inside China — possibly explaining why several informants were killed or imprisoned in a major collapse of the American spy network in China. President Trump received a perfect score on a test screening for neurological impairment on Tuesday. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has subpoenaed the president’s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, to testify before a grand jury investigating links between the President Trump’s associates and Russia. ______ To bitcoin or not to bitcoin? As the price of the behemoth cryptocurrency wavered this week, our reporters dove into the world of virtual currency to examine a tightknit group of friends and enthusiasts who hope to shake up the monetary status quo. If you’re in the mood for a longer read, check out this feature from our magazine, where one writer explains why blockchain platforms could make not just money, but history. And have you heard of Ripple, another cryptocurrency that briefly made one of its co-founders richer than Mark Zuckerberg last week? ______ Grab your raquets. These are the players we’re closely watching at this year’s Australian Open. This is where to find our coverage of all the most important moments and back stories. And remember that whole same-sex marriage thing? We attended one of the first gay weddings for a look at the excitement among vendors who are expecting a boom to the tune of $650 million Australian dollars over the next 12 months. In this week’s Australia Diary, we gathered a collection of poetry that reflects on moments of beauty in nature. And Friday means it’s time for another Besha Rodell review.

1756\Politics\WASHINGTON — Much of the world has soured on American leadership since President Trump took office, a loss of faith that has opened up opportunities for other countries like China, Russia and Germany to assert themselves on the international stage, according to an extensive new survey of people living around the globe. Just 30 percent of people interviewed in 134 countries last year approved of American leadership under Mr. Trump, a drop of nearly 20 percentage points since President Barack Obama’s final year and the lowest finding since the Gallup polling organization began asking the question overseas more than a decade ago. The decline was especially steep in Latin America, Europe and Canada. The findings of the survey come just a week before Mr. Trump plans to go to Europe to attend the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, a traditional gathering of political and economic elites. Mr. Trump has alienated many other countries, including longtime American allies, by pulling back from international agreements and organizations, not to mention by issuing derogatory remarks like those last week denigrating Africa and Haiti. “It makes it more challenging to lead when people are this down on your leadership,” said Jon Clifton, Gallup’s global managing partner. “But on the other hand, if we were sitting with President Trump and his leadership team, they would say these results are understandable because we’re making tough decisions.” Among those decisions has been abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and the Paris climate change accord, undercutting the multinational nuclear deal with Iran, assailing NATO allies for not spending more on their militaries and threatening to scrap free-trade pacts with Mexico, Canada, South Korea and others. The survey showed that approval of American leadership has fallen 10 points or more in 65 of the 134 countries since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, while it increased by that much or more in just four countries: Belarus, Israel, Liberia and Macedonia. It fell by 40 percentage points in Canada (from 60 percent in 2016 to 20 percent in 2017) and 28 percentage points in Mexico (from 44 to 16 percent). Among NATO countries, 18 of 28 had 10-point declines or more, including Italy (14 points), Germany (21 points), Britain (26 points), France (28 points), Belgium (44 points) and Portugal (51 points). Even in Norway, which Mr. Trump singled out last week for praise, saying he would rather immigrants come from there than Africa or Haiti, just 13 percent approved of Mr. Trump’s leadership, down 42 points from Mr. Obama. On the other hand, Africa was a bright spot for Mr. Trump, with 51 percent approving his leadership, just two points lower than the year before. The survey was taken before recent reports of Mr. Trump’s disparaging remarks about some African nations. The results are broadly consistent with a Pew Research Center survey taken last year, but Gallup highlighted the comparison with other major powers. With 41 percent approval, Germany has replaced the United States as the top-rated global power. China at 30 percent has reached nearly even footing, and Russia is barely trailing with 27 percent. The survey conflicts with Mr. Trump’s oft-stated assertion that the world is respecting the United States more under his leadership. Instead, the Gallup reported concluded, Mr. Trump’s foreign policy and his words “have sowed doubt about the U.S. commitment to its partners abroad and called its reliability into question.”\-0.06790349632501602,-0.5578112602233887,0.35205206274986267,1.2331961393356323,-0.21356745064258575,0.29010292887687683,0.5607026219367981,-0.0712270587682724,-0.9680168032646179,-0.7597176432609558,1.1762093305587769,-0.5371524691581726,0.9282633066177368,-0.30712661147117615,-0.9099971652030945,0.4066413938999176,1.5643337965011597,0.43839606642723083,-0.0321500301361084,-0.8013050556182861,1.1385220289230347,-0.31412819027900696,-0.983538031578064,0.41899412870407104,-1.316838026046753,-0.34720897674560547,0.427535742521286,-0.4319746792316437,0.4230605363845825,-1.1625460386276245,1.1074461936950684,0.44433143734931946,-0.2847574055194855,0.3391484320163727,0.4930042028427124,-0.4563867151737213,-0.10540232062339783,-0.9242575764656067,0.31147268414497375,0.32143858075141907,-1.5176115036010742,-0.4261178970336914,-0.319011390209198,-0.02096983604133129,-0.43759116530418396,-0.1262849122285843,-0.13692398369312286,0.47003960609436035,-0.40472888946533203,-1.0162090063095093,1.2493780851364136,0.013156379573047161,0.3697395324707031,0.8657775521278381,1.9562112092971802,-0.5976464152336121,1.1324163675308228,0.24871741235256195,-0.7510547637939453,0.2561006546020508,0.4707159101963043,-1.2329933643341064,-0.36719268560409546,-1.099312663078308,-0.7606882452964783,0.05870535969734192,0.7688125371932983,-0.6235714554786682,0.48692819476127625,0.08019208163022995,0.3273546099662781,-1.4968229532241821,-0.2386929839849472,0.5883182883262634,-0.47816523909568787,-0.32301098108291626,1.3196465969085693,0.530225396156311,0.32598650455474854,-1.44758939743042,0.7477474212646484,-0.6149346232414246,-0.6691455245018005,1.46561598777771,-0.29143810272216797,-1.3314101696014404,0.24194036424160004,0.8403953909873962,0.45541054010391235,0.485747367143631,-0.0950218066573143,-0.030737848952412605,-1.1101622581481934,0.2854591906070709,1.1216840744018555,0.7943129539489746,-0.003998750355094671,-1.2175464630126953,-0.1449761837720871,0.6275122165679932\NYTIMES\Souring World Views of Trump Open Doors for China and Russia\2018-01-18 12:40:28.0\
1757\Politics\It’s hard to miss a musk ox: It looks like a buffalo decked out in a hairy fur coat. And yet this easy-to-spot giant, which lives on tundras from Siberia to Greenland, is still surprisingly mysterious. “Here is the largest land mammal of the polar zones, but we hardly know anything about musk oxen,” said Joel Berger, a wildlife biologist at Colorado State University and a senior scientist at the Wildlife Conservation Society. Dr. Berger has studied musk oxen in Alaska for nearly a decade, and on Thursday in the journal Nature, he and his colleagues reported a disturbing finding: Musk oxen are unexpectedly vulnerable to rapid climate change in the Arctic. In a warming landscape, pregnant female musk oxen may struggle to find enough food for their unborn calves, the researchers found. Their undersized offspring may die young or fail to produce many calves of their own. In places, musk oxen may disappear altogether. The study is the first to suggest a strong link between increasing winter rainfall and the declining health of Arctic mammals, said R. Terry Bowyer, a senior research scientist at the Institute of Arctic Biology in Fairbanks, Alaska, who was not involved in the research. Other grazing species, like caribou or Dall sheep, also may be harmed by increasing rain in the Arctic, Dr. Bowyer said: “It bodes poorly for big mammals.” A decade ago, Dr. Berger began traveling to Alaska to gather data on musk oxen. Each summer, he and his colleagues cruised across the frozen tundra in a sort of snow tractor until they found a herd. Rather than running away, the animals would form a defensive circle. Dr. Berger used long-lens cameras to snap photographs of individuals and bounced lasers off them to determine how far away they were. Back at his office, Dr. Berger and his colleagues examined the pictures to determine how young musk oxen were growing each summer. It was a tough job. “In the wind, their hair is fluttering all over the place, so we don’t know where the hair stops and the body begins,” Dr. Berger said. Fortunately, a musk ox’s face has short hair, and the size of a musk ox’s head is a good indicator of its overall body size. “Our accuracy in measuring head size is about 99 percent,” Dr. Berger said. Calves born in some years remained undersized even three years after birth, he and his colleagues found. To determine why, they also gathered data about the conditions in which the musk oxen lived. One factor emerged as a major predictor of size: how often rain fell during the winter. Females that were pregnant during winters with a lot of rain gave birth to undersized calves, sometimes as much as 15 percent smaller. Dr. Berger started collaborating with Russian scientists to study a population of musk oxen on Wrangel Island, off the coast of northeastern Siberia. The island receives more than twice as many rainfalls during the winter as Dr. Berger’s research sites in Alaska. And on Wrangel Island, he and his colleagues discovered, young musk oxen had significantly smaller heads than their Alaskan cousins. Normally, musk oxen survive each winter by pushing their snouts through snow to find lichen, moss and other plants. When rain falls, it freezes and forms an icy barrier over the food. Dr. Berger suspects that’s why winter rain leaves musk oxen struggling to eat. A pregnant female musk ox is especially vulnerable: “She’s starting her gestating fetus,” Dr. Berger said. The calves of these undernourished mothers will be born small, and they will stay undersized even if they find a regular supply of food as they mature. Research on other big mammals indicates that being born small leaves animals more vulnerable to starvation and disease as they grow. Dr. Berger suspects that his analysis actually underestimates the impact of winter rain. He and his colleagues were able to photograph only young musk oxen that had survived each winter, so it is possible that they missed runts that died between visits. Runts can be bad for the entire herd. Even if small animals survive their early years, it may take them longer to become sexually mature. Winter rain, then, may push down musk oxen populations. These findings are more worrisome because of the drastic change humans are bringing to the climate. The Arctic itself is warming at twice the average global rate. Researchers have focused much of their attention on the Arctic Ocean, which is losing much of its ice. Algae are growing much more vigorously in the warmer climate. Polar bears are losing some of the sea ice they need to hunt for seals, leaving them vulnerable to extinction in decades to come. Climate change is threatening to land mammals, as well. If winter rains become more common in places like Siberia and Alaska, Dr. Berger warned, the range of musk oxen may drastically shrink. Indeed, they may survive only in places like northern Greenland, which has remained drier and colder than other parts of the Arctic. Dr. Berger cautioned that he and his colleagues followed musk oxen only until they were three years old. It will take much more data to determine the long-term fate of the animals. “Most people don’t do that much groundwork on the Arctic because it’s hard to get around,” Dr. Berger said. “It’s no big surprise we know very little.”\1.0145491361618042,0.08422718197107315,-1.0645273923873901,0.2442757487297058,-0.544990062713623,1.1084539890289307,1.5385279655456543,0.22433890402317047,-1.3943301439285278,-0.3809550404548645,0.8382045030593872,1.3365943431854248,-0.3464243412017822,-0.3560255467891693,-1.8644778728485107,1.0145184993743896,-0.7593362331390381,0.42454245686531067,0.7825260162353516,-0.05113326013088226,0.286938339471817,-0.2493053674697876,1.2903107404708862,-2.478919267654419,0.28101691603660583,0.5430932641029358,1.4900988340377808,1.4488441944122314,-0.018220307305455208,-0.4560892879962921,-0.8124820590019226,0.44667404890060425,-0.30830618739128113,0.14397256076335907,-0.30169016122817993,-0.42454037070274353,-0.3345632553100586,-0.44308075308799744,0.12215059995651245,0.20328368246555328,-0.11217794567346573,-0.906018078327179,1.3632209300994873,0.08105406910181046,0.7708078622817993,1.1639420986175537,0.3015612065792084,-0.8343385457992554,-0.7583551406860352,-0.43975308537483215,1.281680703163147,-0.28109031915664673,-0.22846050560474396,0.28713375329971313,-0.2901865243911743,0.5352129936218262,1.9265371561050415,0.2731608748435974,-0.8425095677375793,1.5893006324768066,0.04389252886176109,-2.38246488571167,0.751038134098053,-0.42422348260879517,-0.2827524244785309,0.31755760312080383,0.7922306656837463,0.8052250742912292,-0.8233497738838196,0.22797274589538574,-0.9459660649299622,0.5440139770507812,0.08644051104784012,0.7414432764053345,-0.31443139910697937,-0.5382304787635803,0.0025937471073120832,0.2840903401374817,-1.1373480558395386,-2.0638654232025146,-0.20696553587913513,-1.3444923162460327,-2.0115039348602295,0.533107578754425,0.07020724564790726,-0.3455386757850647,1.2777971029281616,-0.07738260179758072,0.7672157883644104,-1.0097434520721436,-1.064594030380249,0.967781126499176,-1.5546789169311523,0.8965862989425659,1.0378541946411133,1.6085467338562012,0.5919657945632935,-1.1209266185760498,-0.8727751970291138,-0.3324643671512604\NYTIMES\Matter: In the Arctic, More Rain May Mean Fewer Musk Oxen\2018-01-18 11:00:25.0\
1758\Politics\HONG KONG — The pace of growth in China’s economy accelerated last year for the first time in seven years as exports, construction and consumer spending all climbed strongly. At least, that’s what the government says. In reality, the pace of growth in China’s economy is anybody’s guess. Various signals suggest China’s growth did speed up last year, which could give the government the room it needs to tackle an accumulation of serious financial, environmental and social problems this year. But measuring the size and health of the world’s second-largest economy can be difficult at best. Its official figures have become implausibly smooth and steady, even as other countries post results with plenty of peaks and valleys. Officials in far-flung regions are admitting their numbers are wrong. And outside experts crunching the data have come up with different — and usually weaker — results. The National Bureau of Statistics announced on Thursday that the economy expanded 6.9 percent last year, up slightly from 6.7 percent in 2016 and breaking a trend of gradual slowing that began in 2011. For the fourth quarter, the bureau reported economic growth of 6.8 percent over a year earlier. Strength in exports, retail sales and the property market has helped spur growth, putting China in a better position to tackle problems including a sharp climb in debt, severe pollution and other problems. But that growth has come at a high price: rising borrowing that has triggered downgrades of China’s sovereign debt rating by credit rating agencies; severe pollution of China’s air, water and soil; and persistent social problems associated with the movement of tens of millions of workers to cities who had little choice but to leave their children in their hometowns. President Xi Jinping signaled at an important Communist Party meeting in October that he wanted to address some of these chronic problems and that the country should no longer emphasize maximizing economic growth at almost any cost. China’s annual growth figures have long been quite steady. Other large countries have had somewhat steadier growth than usual in the last several years. But China’s quarterly growth figures are suspiciously smooth, unlike quarterly growth in many other countries. Politics are a major reason. Local officials often face pressure to meet targets from the central government. At the first hint of economic weakness, they have tended to step up spending to stabilize economic output. Increasingly, China is owning up to data shortcomings, particularly in provincial data. The region of Inner Mongolia revealed this month that two-fifths of the industrial production it reported for 2016 did not exist. A year ago, Liaoning Province in northeastern China revealed that local governments had padded their economic growth statistics from 2011 to 2014. Tianjin, a sprawling metropolis, briefly posted on one of its official websites last week that previous data had been inflated. The post was quickly deleted. Ning Jizhe, the director of the National Bureau of Statistics, said at a news conference on Thursday afternoon in Beijing that there had long been discrepancies between provincial and national data, but that the gap had been narrowing. “Local data will not influence the reliability of national statistics data,” he said. It can work the other way, too: Some economists cite evidence that China also understates its growth during booms to smooth its results. Economists who try to estimate actual growth tend to come up with lower numbers. The Conference Board, a business group based in New York, takes Chinese data for agriculture, construction and easily counted services, like transportation, as accurate. It then adjusts the official data for irregularities in industrial production and in less easily counted services, like health care. The result shows Chinese growth to be somewhat lower than reported, particularly in years with weak growth. At the same time, by understating the depth of the slowdown in 2015 and 2016, the official figures also appear to understate last year’s improvement. The Conference Board’s results suggest the current uptick is real. But the board worries that much of the growth has come from recent lending, despite China’s already huge accumulation of debt in previous years. “We think the recovery is real,” said Yuan Gao, the senior economist in the Beijing office of the Conference Board. “We’re just concerned that a lot of it is built on bad debt.” Diana Choyleva, an economist at Enodo Economics in London, also produces growth figures that are below the official results. Many economists, including Ms. Choyleva, believe Chinese officials understate how much prices rise in China. That tends to overstate growth. She adjusts official figures based on price data and seasonality. She then finds that the Chinese economy tends to track Beijing’s stimulus efforts, which produce booms, and its moves to curb unsustainable lending, which produce slowdowns. China’s statistical issues go beyond mere government meddling. The country’s economy is vast and quickly changing. Officials still struggle to catch up with years of growth and to modernize data-gathering practices. “It’s just simplistic to say they lie or they don’t lie,” said Pauline Loong, the founder and managing director of Asia-analytica, a Hong Kong consulting firm specializing in mainland China. “They define their data differently, and they keep changing their definitions.”\-0.2605840563774109,0.20646493136882782,0.9244071245193481,0.04470207914710045,-1.1675933599472046,-0.4500603675842285,1.2730902433395386,-0.25659045577049255,-0.9063426852226257,-0.761873722076416,0.44061601161956787,0.6219982504844666,0.0909804254770279,-0.2071470320224762,0.15164582431316376,0.5118281245231628,-0.24760055541992188,0.8093395829200745,-0.193647563457489,0.6489289999008179,-0.15458586812019348,-0.2553715705871582,0.6183595061302185,-0.9010775089263916,-0.9292889833450317,0.5428072810173035,-1.509765625,-1.5148797035217285,0.14148731529712677,-0.6023046970367432,-1.0868841409683228,-0.16321878135204315,-0.43669217824935913,0.8477685451507568,-0.8218579888343811,-0.7508689761161804,-0.2898867726325989,-0.17320559918880463,0.777239978313446,-0.2020137459039688,-1.269801139831543,-1.687660574913025,0.5092760920524597,-0.9330374598503113,1.5192538499832153,-1.2535202503204346,0.4784422218799591,-0.05086776614189148,-0.11657144874334335,1.6201790571212769,-0.48306548595428467,-1.291682243347168,-1.4498834609985352,0.4574275016784668,0.4830170273780823,-1.8289704322814941,0.3313724994659424,0.36877259612083435,-1.61627995967865,0.4530816674232483,0.9181807637214661,-1.4267785549163818,1.6739611625671387,-0.5020473003387451,-1.864703893661499,0.4797932505607605,0.782891571521759,0.6560294032096863,1.479642629623413,-1.2315982580184937,-0.5700792074203491,1.1205685138702393,0.5109566450119019,0.4015083909034729,-0.27754852175712585,-1.407517433166504,0.5140809416770935,-0.5441233515739441,-1.6376250982284546,-1.3028895854949951,-0.352194219827652,0.09507253766059875,-0.6876874566078186,1.9312551021575928,-0.3926143944263458,0.3081568777561188,-1.079304814338684,1.1399915218353271,1.474655032157898,0.34948986768722534,-1.6955132484436035,0.9067704081535339,-1.6516026258468628,1.8490980863571167,0.320564866065979,2.7392003536224365,1.4049431085586548,-1.8721920251846313,0.4985453188419342,1.283263087272644\NYTIMES\China’s Economic Growth Looks Strong.

1759\Politics\The Islamic State on Wednesday claimed responsibility for the twin suicide bombings in Baghdad this week that killed at least 27 people. It was the first major attack in Iraq’s capital since the government declared victory over the terrorist group last month. The nearly simultaneous explosions occurred minutes apart just after 6 a.m. on Monday, with the first assailant detonating his explosives in a square where day laborers were gathering to find work. The second bomber set off his explosives as people rushed to help the wounded, according to a traffic police officer who witnessed the episode. That sequence is a well-established pattern for the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, and is aimed at killing the maximum number of civilians. But the statement released on the messaging app Telegram had a number of errors, including the location of Monday’s attack. It said that it had occurred at Aden Square in Baghdad, where the police said an attack was foiled on Saturday, rather than in Tayaran Square, where Monday’s explosions took place. That error, and the delay in issuing a claim of responsibility, suggests that the Islamic State’s media apparatus has been disrupted in the period since the group lost nearly 98 percent of its territory in Iraq and Syria. In addition, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, said that there were three attackers, not two. The communiqué identified them by code names, and said that the first two detonated their explosive vests in quick succession, while the third hit another gathering in the same area sometime after the first two explosions, according to a translation of the statement provided by SITE Intelligence Group. In its statement, ISIS identified the open-air market that was attacked as a gathering of “rafidha” and of “polytheists,” two words they use to refer to Shiite Muslims in a derogatory manner. The first term, derived from the Arabic root meaning “to reject,” is a reference to the fact that members of the Shiite branch of Islam chose to follow a different lineage from the one followed by Sunnis after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. The second refers to the group’s view that Shiites have strayed from Islam’s monotheistic creed because of the reverence they show for historical figures, like Imam Ali. Of note is the length of time it took for the Islamic State to issue its claim of responsibility. While the group has sometimes taken days to claim responsibility for attacks outside Iraq and Syria, it is unusual for ISIS to delay announcements for an attack in Baghdad, which may suggest a weakening of the group’s media arm.\0.9561862349510193,0.5231987833976746,-0.48084792494773865,0.3088908791542053,-0.5827376842498779,0.4196833074092865,0.38083702325820923,-0.24946168065071106,-0.7868745923042297,-0.6790333986282349,-0.4765876829624176,1.4401659965515137,-0.9874901175498962,1.1556119918823242,-0.9595068097114563,0.4120234251022339,-0.21468740701675415,0.39305663108825684,0.7234156727790833,-0.3744282126426697,0.01667325757443905,0.26978757977485657,0.4730848968029022,0.031254805624485016,-0.8933187127113342,0.21400941908359528,0.684554934501648,0.13060042262077332,0.7138749957084656,0.45111116766929626,-0.5055322647094727,0.436115562915802,-0.0246766097843647,0.18438328802585602,-0.3282901346683502,-0.5723937153816223,0.4771399199962616,0.4411780834197998,-0.5129295587539673,-0.4714823067188263,-0.61869215965271,-0.3298734426498413,-0.04770448058843613,0.15803216397762299,-0.5108063817024231,-0.06167479604482651,-0.07368706911802292,0.5540333390235901,-1.8786011934280396,-0.4091813266277313,0.6714234352111816,-0.7564670443534851,-0.7970476746559143,0.046840064227581024,0.24628756940364838,-0.6685090065002441,0.7872852683067322,-0.8625332713127136,-1.5545039176940918,0.10144790261983871,0.05237339809536934,0.6717962622642517,-0.2959494888782501,0.5689389109611511,0.04156119376420975,0.34670016169548035,1.220950961112976,1.3167264461517334,-0.4698964059352875,0.37328147888183594,0.5242183804512024,0.48179060220718384,-0.8591616153717041,1.0581194162368774,-0.5277560949325562,-1.299854040145874,0.5049487948417664,-0.7209383845329285,-0.8169472217559814,-0.5558513402938843,0.18826265633106232,0.1488560289144516,-0.30017420649528503,0.8323553204536438,0.5897955298423767,0.6932184100151062,-0.21492210030555725,1.0495408773422241,0.6376010179519653,0.7030477523803711,-0.35342416167259216,0.32476773858070374,-0.6345048546791077,-0.08556114137172699,-0.31320643424987793,1.0842783451080322,-0.048719655722379684,-0.6449999809265137,-0.17467613518238068,-0.08140995353460312\NYTIMES\ISIS Claims Responsibility for Baghdad Bombings\2018-01-18 02:03:48.0\
1760\Politics\(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Score one for the power of sports. North and South Korea agreed to have their athletes march together under a “unified Korea” flag, seen above, at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics next month. The nations will also field a joint women’s ice hockey team. The moves are “the most dramatic gesture of reconciliation between the two nations in a decade,” said our Korea correspondent. ____ 2. It’s being called one of the worst U.S. intelligence failures in years: More than a dozen C.I.A. informants in China have been killed or arrested since 2010, as Beijing dismantled American spying operations. We broke the story in May. Now, an American is suspected of having helped Beijing by identifying the informants. Jerry Chun Shing Lee, who left the C.I.A. in 2007, was apprehended in New York this week. Above, an honor guard outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing last year. ____ 3. Stephen Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, has agreed to be interviewed by investigators working for the special counsel in the Russia investigation. The deal allows Mr. Bannon to avoid testifying before a grand jury, a sign that he is cooperating with the investigation. Above, Mr. Bannon was on Capitol Hill to testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. ____ 4. Independent cardiologists who looked at the results from President Trump’s recent physical said they were far from “excellent,” as his doctor had put it. Mr. Trump’s levels of bad cholesterol are very high, which raises the risk of heart attack. His doctor is upping his dose of a cholesterol drug and has recommended a healthier diet and more exercise. ____ 5. Apple plans to bring back the majority of the $252 billion in cash that it has long held abroad, capitalizing on the Republican tax law. The company has big plans for the money. It said it would create more than 20,000 new jobs in the U.S. and open a new campus in a location where it currently has no operations. ____ 6. Moscow got just six minutes of sunlight in December. That’s the darkest December since the city began recording the data. The average for the month — 18 hours — was hardly anything to write home about. Elsewhere in wintry Europe, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain created a new position: minister for loneliness. Health experts warn that isolation can be dangerous, and the new minister will establish programs to alleviate it. ____ 7. Sexual abuse scandals are casting a pall over Pope Francis’ visit to Latin America. He’s already apologized to victims in Chile. But in Peru, where he’s scheduled to arrive Thursday, some are asking why the Vatican is protecting a high-profile layman accused of abuse. Above, a poster welcoming Francis in Lima. ____ 8. Do public universities have to allow white supremacists to speak on campus? That question is playing out across the country. Representatives of the far-right leader Richard Spencer are trying to book him at major universities — and are filing lawsuits when he’s denied the opportunity. Campus administrators are grappling with how to balance freedom of expression and the safety of their students. Above, white supremacists marched through the University of Virginia campus in August. ____ 9. People across the northern U.S. and parts of Canada got a glimpse of a fireball that lit up the sky north of Detroit. The fiery display came from a meteor — likely larger than most — and lasted just a few seconds. Videos, like the one above posted to YouTube, showed a bright flash of light, then a pop, almost like a light bulb burning out. Some people reported hearing a sonic boom. ____ 10. Finally, Trevor Noah was skeptical about President Trump’s health report. “The only thing that looks healthy about Donald Trump is he’s shaped like a food pyramid,” he joked on “The Daily Show.” The celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain will join Mr. Noah on Wednesday. Have a great night. ____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.

1761\Politics\MAIDUGURI, Nigeria — A double suicide bombing at a market in Nigeria’s northern city of Maiduguri killed at least 12 people and wounded 48 others on Wednesday, residents and an emergency official said. Ibrahim Usman, a trader in the Muna Garage market, said the first bomber attacked inside the market while the other remained outside, killing only himself. “Suddenly there was a loud bang and everywhere became disorganized,” Mr. Usman said. “I counted 12 corpses and over 40 injured victims.” The official in charge of rescue operations for the State Emergency Management Agency, Bello Dambatta, said that the bomber who was inside the market was a woman and that the one who remained outside was a man. Although there was no immediate claim of responsibility, the attack was similar to many carried out by the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram. Muna Garage, the site of a camp for displaced people, has been attacked several times in the past few years by Boko Haram insurgents. Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State, has been a refuge for thousands of people displaced by the insurgency in Nigeria’s northeast. Boko Haram, which was formed in Maiduguri, has killed more than 20,000 people in its nine-year insurgency. The group has used women and children as suicide bombers, often after abducting and indoctrinating them.\0.3552583158016205,0.566213846206665,-0.27006447315216064,0.26058393716812134,0.1464526206254959,0.03328399732708931,0.2150357961654663,-0.32456013560295105,-0.9821372032165527,-0.5979119539260864,-0.09096916019916534,0.5356752276420593,0.028152870014309883,-0.16621622443199158,-0.29400983452796936,-0.11548538506031036,0.2718198895454407,-0.17418432235717773,0.45559161901474,0.3512214422225952,-0.14756017923355103,-0.29059794545173645,0.4283578097820282,-0.5806717276573181,-0.6628865003585815,0.12998129427433014,0.06506739556789398,0.053018953651189804,0.2542998790740967,-0.07401587814092636,-0.7572706937789917,-0.3920235335826874,-0.11377201974391937,-0.07552430778741837,0.6740474104881287,-0.4386634826660156,0.1537131816148758,0.5927524566650391,-0.13208459317684174,-0.325824499130249,-0.8218879103660583,-0.36282238364219666,0.2847430408000946,-0.6903521418571472,0.1294701099395752,-0.9726963639259338,-0.32065340876579285,-0.036713212728500366,-0.8738144636154175,-0.3601294159889221,1.2311244010925293,-0.5558321475982666,0.3001804053783417,-0.27285104990005493,1.0234724283218384,0.1027522087097168,1.0507056713104248,0.1535918414592743,-0.16349174082279205,0.11806058138608932,0.2913225591182709,-1.0002974271774292,-0.7401444315910339,-0.1299842894077301,0.05669108033180237,-0.1396569460630417,-0.5264742970466614,0.312794953584671,-0.1123654842376709,-0.13674214482307434,0.09275976568460464,-0.04925454780459404,0.16413292288780212,0.6509445309638977,0.5498029589653015,-0.5520283579826355,-0.2525855302810669,-0.11849811673164368,-0.7686170339584351,0.07745880633592606,0.8662980794906616,-0.473814457654953,-0.3213816285133362,0.5241499543190002,0.008947300724685192,0.15320634841918945,-0.20141072571277618,0.2295733243227005,0.06557036936283112,0.4298039376735687,-0.29110658168792725,0.14844480156898499,-0.049139928072690964,-0.3971726894378662,1.039950966835022,-0.3844793736934662,0.4858037531375885,0.5034424662590027,-0.24014386534690857,0.7610620260238647\NYTIMES\Suicide Bombers Attack Market in Nigeria, Killing at Least 12\2018-01-18 06:07:48.0\1761, 1762
1762\Politics\LAGOS, Nigeria — Gunmen ambushed two Americans and two Canadians traveling through the Nigerian state of Kaduna, kidnapping them and killing two police officers, a state police spokesman said Wednesday. The visitors were heading south from Kafanchan in Kaduna to the capital, Abuja, on Tuesday night when they were ambushed around Kagarko, the Kaduna state police spokesman, Mukhtar Aliyu, said. “The two police escorts attached to them engaged the kidnappers in a fierce gun battle, which resulted in the unfortunate death of the two police officers,” Mr. Aliyu said. The Americans and Canadians are investors setting up solar stations in villages around Kafanchan, Mr. Aliyu said. Security officers, including an anti-kidnapping unit, have been sent to the area to try to rescue the abductees, he said. “ Kidnappings for ransom are common in Nigeria, especially on the Kaduna-to-Abuja highway. Last year, two German archaeologists were seized at gunpoint less than 60 miles northeast of Abuja and later freed unharmed by their kidnappers. In 2016, Sierra Leone’s deputy high commissioner was kidnapped at gunpoint on the highway and held for five days. Victims usually are freed unharmed after a ransom is paid, though security forces have rescued a few high-profile abductees. A number of people, including herdsmen, have been arrested.\0.20312319695949554,-0.459794819355011,0.209448903799057,-0.16902147233486176,0.20139430463314056,-0.06810940057039261,1.0538339614868164,-0.40157458186149597,-0.3726247549057007,-0.20481730997562408,-0.6034395694732666,0.9048437476158142,0.2148631513118744,-0.3830466568470001,0.4100238084793091,0.022556116804480553,-0.7139294147491455,0.04076354205608368,-0.044446032494306564,0.31475120782852173,0.7971267700195312,-0.4872164726257324,-0.2974659204483032,0.2449377477169037,0.046660732477903366,0.09484849125146866,0.8523468375205994,0.38090530037879944,-0.09089972078800201,0.3941517174243927,0.01644532009959221,-0.5372499823570251,-0.33782249689102173,0.3684815466403961,1.0156806707382202,-0.9941569566726685,-0.10086498409509659,0.7089871168136597,0.31780195236206055,-0.4166908860206604,-0.1072210967540741,-0.8684391379356384,-0.11799357831478119,-0.2891677916049957,-0.3373677134513855,-0.631925642490387,-0.12350881099700928,-0.006971332244575024,-1.4410685300827026,-0.3581046760082245,0.4762905538082123,0.12565290927886963,0.8949275016784668,-0.049578115344047546,0.3831126391887665,-0.3285300135612488,0.2942132353782654,-0.24960926175117493,0.03037191927433014,0.4738955795764923,0.3685563802719116,-0.5123409032821655,0.16417890787124634,-0.3385395109653473,-0.45303529500961304,0.7424277663230896,0.982228696346283,1.3501204252243042,-0.2693040668964386,0.7516703605651855,-0.04491240531206131,-0.2251681238412857,-1.021062970161438,0.4787923991680145,-0.16156698763370514,0.45989990234375,-0.0017197239212691784,0.5096532702445984,-0.20909440517425537,-0.9374188184738159,0.7686989903450012,-0.659920334815979,-0.9474398493766785,0.8504142165184021,0.007260243408381939,-0.3309476673603058,0.5339823961257935,0.706278920173645,-0.0096353804692626,0.49190443754196167,0.08339724689722061,0.01120876707136631,-0.536795973777771,-0.5936925411224365,-0.36418965458869934,1.0961071252822876,-0.27521198987960815,-0.3319911062717438,-1.14922034740448,0.6334022879600525\NYTIMES\Gunmen Kidnap 2 Americans and 2 Canadians in Nigeria\2018-01-17 23:37:00.0\1761, 1762
1763\Politics\WASHINGTON — American troops will remain in Syria long after their fight against the Islamic State to ensure that neither Iran nor President Bashar al-Assad of Syria take over areas that have been newly liberated with help from the United States, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said on Wednesday. Staying in Syria, Mr. Tillerson said, will help ensure that the Trump administration does not repeat what he described as the mistakes of former President Barack Obama, who withdrew troops from Iraq before the extremist threat was doused and failed to stabilize Libya after NATO airstrikes that led to the overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. “We cannot allow history to repeat itself in Syria,” Mr. Tillerson said during a speech at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University near San Francisco. “ISIS has one foot in the grave, and by maintaining an American military presence in Syria until the full and complete defeat of ISIS is achieved, it will soon have two.” ISIS is another name for the Islamic State. There were roughly 2,000 American troops in Syria last month, a mix of engineering units that build fortifications and Special Operations units that fight and train with local militias. Additionally, American military contractors in Syria help demine recaptured areas as the Islamic State is pushed back. Mr. Tillerson’s comments were the first time a senior Trump administration official pledged to keep American troops in Syria well after the current battle ends. They also marked another step in President Trump’s gradual evolution from a populist firebrand who promised to extricate the United States from foreign military entanglements to one who is grudgingly accepting many of the national security strategies he once derided. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said that “at some point, we cannot be the policeman of the world.” Mr. Obama won the White House in 2008 in part by promising to wind down the war in Iraq, and agreed to only a limited role in the 2011 airstrikes in Libya. Those decisions have haunted the military officers who now serve in Mr. Trump’s cabinet and, in turn, have led to the administration’s deepening military involvement in Afghanistan. Mr. Trump has said American forces must remain in Afghanistan because “a hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum for terrorists, including ISIS and Al Qaeda.” Mr. Tillerson repeated that rationale in outlining the administration’s decision to keep forces in Syria. He did not say whether other countries would help pay for the American military effort or other stabilization costs, even though Mr. Trump also promised during the presidential campaign that he would compel Germany and Persian Gulf nations to contribute financing “because they have the money.” Mr. Tillerson said the military commitment to Syria was “conditions-based” and not indefinite. But he underscored that it would take time to foster a democratically elected government in Syria that he — like the Obama administration — said would require Mr. Assad’s departure from power. “Responsible change may not come as immediately as some hope for, but rather through an incremental process of constitutional reform and U.N.-supervised elections,” he said. Analysts raised concerns that there might never come a time when withdrawal would be deemed appropriate. “Yes, we can leave troops there for the foreseeable future,” said Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley, a former ambassador and career diplomat. “But is that 20 years, the way Afghanistan soon will be?” The United States has five key goals in Syria, Mr. Tillerson said. They are: ensuring that the Islamic State and Al Qaeda never re-emerge; supporting the United Nations-led political process; diminishing Iran’s influence; making sure the country is free of weapons of mass destruction; and helping refugees to return after years of civil war. Mr. Tillerson conceded the steep challenge in fostering peace and democracy in Syria, where efforts by world leaders and diplomats across the Middle East and the West have fallen short. He is working on a reorganization of the State Department, which so far has resulted in steep budget cuts and the departure of some of its most senior diplomats, including some top Middle East experts. Such expertise is vital to any military or diplomatic ventures in the Middle East, where contradictory and crosscutting rivalries are endemic. For instance, American backing for a Kurdish-led border force in northeastern Syria has raised alarms in the region and is vehemently opposed by Russia, Turkey, Iran and Mr. Assad’s government. The border force has been described as a “terror army” by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who worries it will be operated by a Kurdish militia that he considers a threat to his country. On Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag of Turkey said his country had reached the limit of its patience regarding developments along its borders. Mr. Tillerson sought to allay the concerns, saying that “any interim arrangements must be truly representative and must not threaten any neighboring states.” Nawaf Khalil, a former official in the Syrian Kurdish local government who now works at a German research institute, praised Mr. Tillerson’s speech as “a clear American vision on the situation in Syria.” “Stressing the importance of diplomacy, as well as strengthening U.S. allies in the region, is the needed approach at this stage,” Mr. Khalil said. He added: “It finally seems like the White House and the Pentagon are on the same page in Syria.” There was no immediate comment from the Syrian government, but it has consistently rejected any American interference as illegal and counterproductive.\0.8656265735626221,0.21895286440849304,-1.7252748012542725,1.1807869672775269,-1.108141541481018,-0.3675537407398224,1.052686095237732,-0.6868418455123901,-0.7210642695426941,-0.7592127919197083,0.2183268517255783,-0.20900818705558777,-0.8150285482406616,1.4502424001693726,-1.2239136695861816,0.16928783059120178,0.6971765160560608,-1.1498548984527588,-0.3441215753555298,-0.5459251403808594,-0.1419103741645813,-0.3088216185569763,0.22763222455978394,-0.3209749460220337,-0.9102158546447754,-0.4814043641090393,1.8850045204162598,1.1320366859436035,-0.8647881746292114,-0.4685729742050171,6.119897589087486E-4,0.8897444605827332,-0.11719074100255966,0.8434287309646606,-0.20147661864757538,-0.4010278582572937,-0.7519674897193909,-0.2008926272392273,0.0030254467856138945,-0.33879587054252625,-1.4810564517974854,-1.8204140663146973,-0.45491331815719604,-1.627318263053894,-0.08597972989082336,0.5016384720802307,-0.8055510520935059,0.2893909513950348,-1.420768141746521,-0.6153137683868408,0.2895183861255646,-1.0397398471832275,1.0179136991500854,0.2650393843650818,2.1608502864837646,-0.9227551221847534,1.957413673400879,-0.06310071796178818,-1.432593822479248,0.8104808330535889,0.19258151948451996,0.9947496056556702,0.31800490617752075,-0.12623198330402374,-2.683098554611206,0.6827280521392822,1.5672014951705933,0.06325802206993103,-0.8348526358604431,1.5705524682998657,0.9343060255050659,-0.7690852880477905,0.3189915716648102,0.6483920216560364,-2.1465790271759033,-1.4098575115203857,-0.6868311762809753,0.38675397634506226,-0.5542310476303101,-1.2143827676773071,-0.07252341508865356,-0.38123518228530884,-0.6858591437339783,0.46083760261535645,0.6399787664413452,1.0998291969299316,0.26721057295799255,-0.2877243757247925,0.15390290319919586,0.9259681701660156,-1.347055196762085,1.0212901830673218,-1.893864631652832,-0.611914873123169,0.14307209849357605,-0.3411791920661926,0.23692670464515686,-0.96709144115448,-2.2922911643981934,0.3889920711517334\NYTIMES\Tillerson Says U.S. Troops to Stay in Syria Beyond Battle With ISIS\2018-01-18 00:31:57.0\
1764\Politics\LONDON — Facebook said on Wednesday it was reopening and broadening an internal investigation into the possibility that Russia had used the platform to influence the British vote to leave the European Union. Reports that the Kremlin had used Facebook and other social media to try to sway elections in the United States, France and other countries have raised widespread suspicions that it had played the same game in the June 2016 British referendum. Russia has long viewed the European Union as a threat, and promoting the groups that favored Britain’s leaving would be one way to weaken the bloc. But the possibility of Russian interference has threatened to further complicate the torturous negotiations with Brussels over Britain’s departure, known as Brexit, by undermining the credibility of the referendum. After the British Parliament asked Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies last year for information on any Russian efforts to sway the vote, Facebook said in December that it had found no evidence of manipulation. But lawmakers complained that Facebook’s internal research had been inadequate, and on Wednesday, the social media giant acknowledged that its previous investigation had focused only on the Russian-linked accounts already identified by United States intelligence agencies as having been active in the 2016 presidential election. “Our investigatory team is now looking to see if we can identify other similar clusters engaged in coordinated activity around the Brexit referendum that was not identified previously,” Simon Milner, Facebook’s policy director for Britain, wrote in a letter to Parliament. Facebook faces a greater challenge in identifying potential Russian activity around the Brexit vote — if any exists — because British intelligence agencies have not identified a list of suspected accounts, as the American agencies did. “We would be very interested in receiving any information, including intelligence assessments or reports, that you and the U.K. government may have that is relevant to this work,” Mr. Milner said in his letter, noting that the inquiry “requires detailed analysis of historic data by our security experts.” Academic researchers have analyzed information from other social media platforms such as Twitter, where data is more accessible, and a few have found indications of Russian activity but not conclusive evidence. Many have urged more disclosure by Facebook, Twitter and other companies, which possess internal information about users and payments. A study by the Oxford Internet Institute concluded there was scarce evidence that the Kremlin had exploited the social media platforms to influence the British vote. Damian Collins, the Conservative member of Parliament leading the inquiry, said in a statement, however, that “companies like Facebook should initiate their own research into issues like this, where there is such clear public concern, and not just act on intelligence that has been passed to them.” “They are best placed to investigate activity on their platform.”\-0.48483461141586304,0.15314242243766785,-0.2991676926612854,-0.14199219644069672,0.9993241429328918,0.40897035598754883,0.5408266186714172,-0.23393437266349792,-0.9607442021369934,-1.0212987661361694,0.6189162135124207,0.3678426444530487,-1.056458592414856,0.14345020055770874,0.011303394101560116,0.5949996113777161,1.176614761352539,-0.24635876715183258,0.13409875333309174,0.01446265447884798,-0.1980540156364441,-0.21509963274002075,-0.4019485116004944,-0.06357844173908234,-1.1020985841751099,0.8331411480903625,-0.6634588837623596,-0.7054176926612854,0.045674216002225876,-0.25862905383110046,0.28011566400527954,0.5514751672744751,-0.18348348140716553,-0.7220430970191956,0.5668368935585022,0.507048487663269,-1.2824469804763794,-0.14730726182460785,-0.01880616322159767,0.11734519898891449,-0.8013951182365417,-0.9425878524780273,-0.15787729620933533,-0.44036394357681274,-0.5156651139259338,-0.0361206978559494,0.418783038854599,0.9152884483337402,-0.7857463359832764,-0.7839990854263306,-0.16330121457576752,-0.862113356590271,0.46192869544029236,0.3498288691043854,0.7862597107887268,-1.1935464143753052,1.571988582611084,-0.06800934672355652,-0.7925248146057129,0.7628204226493835,-0.14088763296604156,-0.016846299171447754,0.7657145261764526,0.8692274689674377,-0.6068816184997559,0.01668156124651432,1.0945184230804443,0.7990515828132629,-1.253302812576294,1.1747500896453857,0.9247469902038574,0.2710171043872833,0.37062737345695496,-0.5664023160934448,-0.08842907845973969,-0.03167128935456276,0.3201441466808319,0.8029364943504333,0.173889622092247,-0.9166385531425476,0.06160388141870499,0.6546944379806519,-1.2512539625167847,-0.06336703896522522,0.20241309702396393,0.0052999225445091724,0.12907558679580688,-0.13036300241947174,0.6821144223213196,-0.7203759551048279,0.07451565563678741,0.9236078262329102,-1.1367852687835693,0.3225388824939728,-0.4644019901752472,-0.10256581008434296,0.5697019696235657,-0.6143543720245361,-0.9488305449485779,0.47382286190986633\NYTIMES\Facebook to Take Broader Look at Possible Russian Role in Brexit Vote\2018-01-18 00:16:44.0\1764, 1828
1765\Politics\HONG KONG — Violence has again convulsed the western state of Rakhine in Myanmar, the same region where the United Nations has accused the country’s authorities of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya minority. At least seven ethnic Rakhine protesters were killed by the police and 12 others were injured on Tuesday evening during a march commemorating the 233rd anniversary of the fall of the Rakhine, or Arakan, kingdom to an invading Burmese army. The local government had canceled the march, in Mrauk-U, the ancient Arakan capital, but a rally of about 4,000 people gathered anyway, with marchers surrounding local government offices while placing a Rakhine flag on a national flagpole. Protesters then attacked government offices, as well as motorbikes and cars parked nearby, according to U Tin Maung Swe, the secretary of the Rakhine State government. He said the police had fired bullets into the crowd because “the people were trying to take the guns from the police.” On Wednesday, an arrest warrant was issued for Dr. Aye Maung, a founder of the region’s largest ethnic Rakhine political party and an organizer of the thwarted anniversary rally, for a controversial speech he had given. Wai Hing Aung, a Rakhine social critic, was also detained the previous evening for giving a speech in another part of Rakhine. Both men have been implicated in various crimes, including unlawful association and fomenting public mischief. “My brother has been arrested because his speech was highly critical of the government and the government thinks it might destroy the nation’s sovereignty,” said U Thein Win, Mr. Wai Hing Aung’s brother. “But my brother is just a writer who also loves charity work.” Dr. Aye Maung noted that his position in Parliament could give him immunity from any charges, but nevertheless called the legal action “hitting with an ax instead of with a pin.” In his earlier speech, Dr. Aye Maung had made his feelings known about the ethnic Bamar, who make up Myanmar’s majority, including its civilian and military leadership. “Bamar people do not give equal chances to Rakhine people,” he said, according to an official recounting of the speech. “And they just push Rakhine people around as their slaves.” Ethnic Rakhine Buddhists have also been angered by an announcement by the Myanmar government that it will accept back a limited number of Rohingya Muslim refugees who have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar in recent months. More than 655,000 Rohingya have fled western Myanmar since August, when an attack on police posts by Rohingya insurgents catalyzed a brutal campaign of rape, murder and arson by Myanmar’s army and associated ethnic Rakhine vigilantes. Hundreds of Rohingya villages were burned to the ground, according to satellite images collected by human rights groups. The United States also uses the term ethnic cleansing to describe the military’s campaign against the Rohingya. But ethnic Rakhine and Myanmar’s government accuse the Rohingya of being illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, despite the Muslim group’s deep roots in the region. Rakhine State, with its majority Rakhine Buddhists and minority Rohingya Muslims, has long been an ethnic tinderbox. In 2012, deadly sectarian clashes broke out between the two groups, mostly in or near the state capital, Sittwe. Most of the dead were Rohingya, and many of the Rohingya remain in internment camps set up by Myanmar’s government, while ethnic Rakhine affected by the 2012 violence were long ago allowed to integrate back into society. The violence in Rakhine State is not limited to tensions between the Rohingya and the Rakhine. For years before the Rohingya crisis exploded, Myanmar’s military battled the Arakan Army, a guerrilla group fighting for the rights of ethnic Rakhine. In the first half of 2016, the Arakan Army killed at least 300 Myanmar soldiers, according to a Myanmar military document. Myanmar’s army has been fighting various ethnic armies for decades, mostly in areas rich with natural resource reserves. In Rakhine State, ethnic Rakhine bristle at the fact that their state has great natural-gas potential yet cannot manage a stable supply of electricity in the state capital, much less in rural areas. Ethnic Rakhine also are frustrated because their state ranks as the poorest in an already poor country. The United Nations, one of the few international organizations to maintain long-term staffing in Rakhine, responded quickly to the riots. “We deplore the loss of life and injuries that have been reported,” it said in a statement. “We urge respect for the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression.”\1.6109623908996582,0.9161435961723328,-0.9868137836456299,-0.47722455859184265,-0.7970658540725708,-0.27982255816459656,1.1302989721298218,-0.0946827158331871,-1.1337379217147827,-0.5579897165298462,0.054475072771310806,0.8933700323104858,-0.3093819320201874,0.3136478662490845,0.1604437530040741,-0.8319459557533264,-1.7483112812042236,0.15287566184997559,-0.2590228021144867,-0.13367263972759247,-0.4861896336078644,-0.793154239654541,0.4476301372051239,0.43685808777809143,0.2100105583667755,-0.16742472350597382,0.8685668110847473,-0.45523783564567566,-0.25646883249282837,0.7688266634941101,-1.600581407546997,-0.35957619547843933,-0.033780787140131,0.30963191390037537,0.43053439259529114,-0.32150787115097046,-0.505237877368927,-0.25258973240852356,-0.8839695453643799,-0.9032028913497925,0.13875730335712433,-0.9947332739830017,0.5353333353996277,-0.900952160358429,0.3091976046562195,-0.1502978801727295,0.38016477227211,-0.18915776908397675,-2.327620029449463,0.31056761741638184,0.5623719096183777,-1.188846468925476,-0.8196953535079956,0.8063536882400513,0.5760722160339355,-1.5359097719192505,1.5115323066711426,0.5016605257987976,-0.973983108997345,0.04691634699702263,0.3496009111404419,0.9135838747024536,0.6633172631263733,1.185855746269226,-1.0600109100341797,-0.19787147641181946,1.0522375106811523,0.8718334436416626,-0.5490736961364746,0.994770348072052,0.6814110279083252,0.0995597392320633,-1.3006927967071533,0.3346441686153412,-0.6652260422706604,-0.8749325275421143,1.2393673658370972,-0.16159293055534363,-0.15052275359630585,-1.957909107208252,0.1740085780620575,-0.5631084442138672,-1.5094608068466187,0.85467529296875,0.5349276065826416,-0.10745366662740707,0.44649630784988403,0.18861669301986694,0.39272549748420715,0.9416394233703613,-0.07077085971832275,0.9699422717094421,-1.1388053894042969,0.12164249271154404,-0.03935039043426514,-0.707655668258667,1.3260400295257568,0.003518992103636265,-0.09125491231679916,1.2078771591186523\NYTIMES\Myanmar Police Gun Down Marchers in Rakhine Ethnic Rally\2018-01-17 21:15:05.0\
1766\Politics\MOSCOW — For anyone who braves the Russian winter, overcast skies and short, dark days are a depressing reality. But even those bleak expectations were shattered in December, when Moscow was shrouded in an unrelenting cloud cover for all but six minutes. It was the darkest December in the capital since the city began recording the data, the previous worst having come in 2000, when the sun checked in for a meager three hours. The average amount of sunlight for December — 18 hours — is hardly anything to write home about. “When they hear about this, many people say, ‘It’s clear now why I was depressed,’ ” said Roman Vilfand, the director of Russia’s Weather Service, according to the news agency Tass. Muscovites have any number of reasons to be depressed: a stagnant economy, horrendous traffic and, for some, the prospect that Vladimir V. Putin will soon win another six-year term as president. But the dearth of sunlight undoubtedly has contributed to a surge in visits to psychiatrists in Moscow even beyond the expected seasonal rise, the daily newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets reported. The reports have unleashed a tide of snarky comment on social media. “And this at a time when the country is rising from its knees and has won the war in Syria...” an anonymous commenter wrote in response to the Moskovsky Komsomolets article. “Why do you need the sun, if your ‘special path’ is illuminated by the sunfaced Putin,” wrote another, identified by the handle pinchofhate. “Hillary’s revenge,” an American, Steve Lemson, chimed in. The dismal December followed an unusually cold and wet summer, which also seems to have darkened moods. In June, the Moscow Office for Psychological Assistance recorded a 14 percent rise in calls, compared to those in the same period in 2016. Mr. Vilfand attributed the gloom to warm Atlantic air masses that continually swept over the region with strong, damp winds that thickened the cloud cover. That lifted average December temperatures by nearly 6 degrees. The people of Yakutia, a region in Russia’s far east, could use a little of that air right now. A cold spell there has approached record levels, prompting hundreds of schools to close and grounding public transport. Temperatures in some places have plummeted to minus 85 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 65 degrees Celsius), claiming at least two lives over the weekend, Interfax reported. A photo of Anastasia Gruzdeva standing outside in Yakutsk, the regional capital, with frost-covered eyelashes has garnered more than 40,000 ‘‘likes’’ on Instagram. “This is nothing but a trip to work in -47,” Ms. Gruzdeva posted, citing the temperature in Celsius. “Now, every girl in Yakutsk has a photo like this.” The severe cold is traveling west from Yakutia. In Norilsk, an industrial city in Russia’s Arctic region, the temperature plunged to minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 45 degrees Celsius) on Wednesday, with warnings of a further drop to 67 degrees below zero on Thursday. None of this will spoil a holiday celebration, however. On Friday, people across Russia will step outside and plunge into ice-cold water for the annual Epiphany dip. In Yakutia, preparations are already underway.\1.6670551300048828,-0.7244399189949036,-0.44447290897369385,-0.17232993245124817,-1.2868484258651733,0.009441209025681019,0.9364804029464722,-0.19394691288471222,-0.7323533296585083,-0.18365609645843506,0.36371737718582153,0.375347375869751,0.04284277930855751,0.08213751018047333,-0.9174098372459412,0.26547661423683167,0.14792850613594055,-0.24941471219062805,0.022134261205792427,0.6610878109931946,-0.033452365547418594,0.3847384750843048,0.39389798045158386,-0.5007808208465576,0.1459544599056244,0.5616062879562378,0.22085116803646088,-0.5215474963188171,-0.7436395883560181,-0.12293826788663864,0.7045000791549683,-0.03661566227674484,-0.5018568634986877,0.8858672976493835,0.061883650720119476,0.21593329310417175,-0.4829644560813904,-0.5337709784507751,0.637856662273407,-0.08810736984014511,-0.7599831223487854,-1.0688022375106812,1.6133261919021606,-0.6993863582611084,0.22135768830776215,0.8058687448501587,0.8461835384368896,0.19270096719264984,-1.5081961154937744,-0.8568695783615112,0.3420979082584381,-0.22777941823005676,-0.674238383769989,0.3391212821006775,-0.16476577520370483,-0.3586390018463135,0.8881211876869202,1.108093023300171,-0.2577241063117981,1.497675895690918,0.18242022395133972,-0.40547701716423035,0.5543153285980225,0.2322429120540619,-0.6358858942985535,0.5665262937545776,-0.06300612539052963,0.6331707239151001,-0.34281641244888306,1.2430155277252197,-0.36037302017211914,0.6234866380691528,-0.25117555260658264,0.40991467237472534,0.17191487550735474,-0.22194597125053406,0.5584081411361694,0.8915350437164307,-1.246612548828125,-0.5975924730300903,-0.5595139265060425,-0.4268210530281067,-0.6176925301551819,0.6600659489631653,0.4889928102493286,-0.7629567384719849,0.1058390736579895,0.3651605546474457,1.1353676319122314,0.5605363845825195,-0.7907322645187378,1.5802885293960571,-0.6516503095626831,0.7354531288146973,-0.10186818242073059,-0.1421222686767578,-0.14698436856269836,-0.7056090831756592,-0.2841140329837799,0.6743903756141663\NYTIMES\Moscow Got 6 Minutes of Sunlight in December\2018-01-17 21:51:45.0\
1767\Politics\LONDON — Since Britain voted to leave the European Union more than a year ago, Europeans have mockingly said that the decision will result in an isolated, lonely island nation. But Britain, in fact, already has a serious problem with loneliness, research has found. More than nine million people in the country often or always feel lonely, according to a 2017 report published by the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness. The issue prompted Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday to appoint a minister for loneliness. “For far too many people, loneliness is the sad reality of modern life,” Mrs. May said in a statement. “I want to confront this challenge for our society and for all of us to take action to address the loneliness endured by the elderly, by carers, by those who have lost loved ones — people who have no one to talk to or share their thoughts and experiences with.” Mark Robinson, the chief officer of Age UK, Britain’s largest charity working with older people, warned that the problem could kill. “It’s proven to be worse for health than smoking 15 cigarettes a day, but it can be overcome and needn’t be a factor in older people’s lives,” he said. A former United States surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, wrote an article for the Harvard Business Review last year arguing that loneliness needed addressing in the workplace. It can be associated, he wrote, “with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, depression and anxiety.” The British report was commissioned by the Red Cross in partnership with the Co-op, a cooperative supermarket chain, and published by the Cox commission in December. The group operates in memory of Ms. Cox, 41, a Labour Party lawmaker who was shot dead by a right-wing extremist in 2016, and who had been a prominent voice in Parliament on the issue, setting up a cross-party commission that aimed to start a national conversation and establish the scale and impact of loneliness in Britain. The prime minister announced on Wednesday that Tracey Crouch, who is the under secretary for sport and civil society in the culture ministry, would lead a governmentwide group to build on Ms. Cox’s legacy and establish policies on the issue. In parallel, the Office for National Statistics would help to establish a method of measuring loneliness, and a fund would be set up to help the government and charities to develop a wider strategy to identify opportunities to tackle the problem. The Cox commission, led by the lawmakers Rachel Reeves and Seema Kennedy, said it welcomed the government’s “prompt response” to its report. Quoting Ms. Cox, the lawmakers said in a joint statement, “Young or old, loneliness doesn’t discriminate.” “Throughout 2017 we have heard from new parents, children, disabled people, carers, refugees and older people about their experience of loneliness,” they added. Government research has found that about 200,000 older people in Britain had not had a conversation with a friend or relative in more than a month. Carol Jenkins, 64, a retired nurse from Berkshire, in southwest England, said she started to feel lonely when her son moved abroad and she downsized to a smaller house in a different county. “It was a financial decision to move, and I didn’t really have it in me to start making new friends,” Ms. Jenkins recalled on Wednesday in a phone interview. “Months would go by without seeing my friends or family, and I felt really depressed and alone.” Ms. Jenkins has since joined a Facebook group for Britons affected by loneliness, which, she says, has helped her to get out of the house more. “It’s not so much about meeting people on the internet and making new friends, but it’s more of a motivational support network that gives you direction on how to cope and fix the problem,” she said, adding that she was surprised by how many young people had joined the group. “There are so many university students who just lock themselves in their rooms for days because they feel rejected or that they don’t fit in,” Ms. Jenkins said. “It’s only a matter of time before loneliness turns into depression. And that’s where it gets dangerous.”\1.0542556047439575,0.6111291646957397,0.25359609723091125,-0.46515145897865295,0.25567513704299927,1.364019513130188,1.4162285327911377,-0.8782455921173096,-0.7093095779418945,-0.41516193747520447,-0.0024884117301553488,0.8005954623222351,-0.7622969746589661,1.0785274505615234,-0.41234344244003296,0.34739410877227783,-0.15788708627223969,-0.6085017919540405,0.4232844412326813,-0.31656110286712646,-0.7150847315788269,-0.6189156174659729,-0.10828849673271179,-0.6494486331939697,8.906592847779393E-4,1.0049364566802979,0.3691554367542267,-0.6677529811859131,-0.33426177501678467,-0.6255805492401123,-0.20932242274284363,1.2235060930252075,1.339050054550171,0.40436041355133057,0.23953840136528015,-0.2424992173910141,0.7921532392501831,-0.7416820526123047,-0.6487306356430054,-0.9164023399353027,-0.8082705140113831,-1.0270544290542603,0.7970219254493713,-0.34639978408813477,-0.3294752538204193,0.1519027054309845,0.9264368414878845,0.6576837301254272,-1.00296151638031,1.3707222938537598,0.17898425459861755,-0.29986217617988586,-0.218389093875885,-0.19094666838645935,1.4687970876693726,-0.1450762152671814,1.7027589082717896,-0.42190778255462646,-0.5489785671234131,1.2517447471618652,-0.23914538323879242,-0.7125994563102722,-0.0666167363524437,0.3229241669178009,-0.5043901205062866,-0.3911547064781189,0.6830222606658936,1.0551121234893799,-1.245240569114685,1.022713541984558,1.2009220123291016,0.7203554511070251,-0.7950851321220398,-0.13297152519226074,-1.0488252639770508,-0.7739816308021545,-1.134819507598877,0.3398662507534027,-1.4641724824905396,-0.5389835238456726,0.20817378163337708,-0.38807153701782227,-1.9387104511260986,0.7474792003631592,0.4036698639392853,0.5300212502479553,0.20693276822566986,0.35902947187423706,0.282390832901001,-0.3746672570705414,-0.041670672595500946,-0.33268946409225464,-1.718998670578003,0.571580171585083,0.708646297454834,2.6781647466123104E-4,-0.41680315136909485,-0.7715477347373962,-1.2503645420074463,1.2069545984268188\NYTIMES\U.K. Appoints a Minister for Loneliness\2018-01-18 08:44:57.0\
1768\Politics\HONG KONG — North and South Korea agreed on Wednesday to march their athletes together under one flag at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics next month and to field a joint women’s ice hockey team. It was the most dramatic gesture of reconciliation between them in a decade. South Korea, host of the games, has said it hopes such a partnership in sports could contribute to a political thaw after years of high tensions. It came even as the prospect of war over the North’s nuclear and missile tests has grown especially acute. The Games will begin on Feb. 9 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and the women’s ice-hockey squad will be the first combined Korean team for the Olympics, and the first unified team since their athletes played together for an international table-tennis championship and a youth soccer tournament in 1991. The two countries’ delegations will march at the opening ceremony behind a “unified Korea” flag that shows an undivided Korean Peninsula, negotiators from both sides said in a joint news release after talks at the border village of Panmunjom. The North will send 230 supporters to the Games, and negotiators agreed that supporters of both Koreas would root together for athletes from both countries. The prospect of North and South Koreans cheering together offers a stunning contrast to the bombastic rhetoric of possible war from North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un and President Trump of the United States, South Korea’s main ally. Mr. Trump has threatened the North with “fire and fury like the world has never seen” should it put the security of Americans and their allies at risk. Mr. Kim has called Mr. Trump a lunatic. The Olympics agreement could help President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who has been pushing for dialogue and reconciliation with the North. Few expect that the breakthrough will lead to a quick breakthrough in the decades-old standoff over the North’s nuclear weapons program. But it provided a welcome reprieve for South Koreans who have grown both alarmed and weary over the tensions and talks of possible war in the peninsula. The news was welcomed by top officials at the United Nations, where Secretary General António Guterres has said he plans to attend the opening ceremonies. The president of the General Assembly, Miroslav Lajcak of Slovakia, said on Twitter: “Heartened by reports that Koreans from DPRK & RoK will march together in @Olympics opening ceremony.” The two countries also agreed on Wednesday that their skiing teams would train together in the Masikryong ski resort in North Korea. The resort, a showpiece project of the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, was opened in 2013. South Korean officials said on Wednesday that the North’s delegation would include at least 550 people, including about 150 to the Paralympic Games in March. But the joint news statement said that the final number would be determined in Switzerland on Saturday, when the International Olympic Committee is to bring together North and South Korean officials. The plan is for the North’s athletes to enter the South over a land border on Feb. 1. So far, the only North Korean athletes to qualify for the Pyeongchang Games are a pairs figure skating team. North Korea missed an Oct. 31 deadline to accept invitations from South Korea and the International Olympic Committee to join the Games. But the international body has said it remains willing to consider wild-card entries for North Korean athletes. A unified team of any kind at the Olympics would be a milestone for the Koreas, which have been bitter rivals in international sports as well as diplomacy and armed conflict, but which also have a history of trying to use sports as an avenue for reconciliation. Mr. Moon proposed in June that the two Koreas form a unified team for the Pyeongchang Games, but the suggestion was not taken seriously until the Mr. Kim used his New Year’s Day speech to propose dialogue with the South and to discuss his country’s participation in the Olympics. That proposal led to a series of talks in Panmunjom between the two Korean governments. In an earlier round of negotiations, the North agreed to send a 140-member orchestra to play in the South during the Olympics. The prospect of fostering inter-Korean reconciliation through sports and other channels has strong appeal in South Korea, so much so that successive governments have tried to negotiate sending a unified team to the Olympics. Such efforts have sometimes led to breakthroughs. In 2000, the year of the first inter-Korean summit meeting, the countries’ delegations marched together at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics. They have marched together nine times, including in Athens in 2004, carrying a blue-and-white flag representing a united Korea, and at the 2006 Winter Olympics. The two Koreas last marched together in the Asian Winter Games of 2007. But forming a joint Olympic team proved elusive. Past negotiations faltered over such details as whether a joint team would have an equal number of players from each country, who would choose the coaches and where the athletes would train. South Korean athletes, who have far more resources and Olympic experience than their counterparts from the North, have balked in the past at the idea of sacrificing their hard-earned prospects for the sake of parity with North Korea in a united team. South Korean news outlets have reported that the South asked the International Olympic Committee to allow a unified hockey team to have an expanded roster, so that none of the South Korean players would have to bow out of the Games. South Korea first sought to use sports to ease military tensions with the North back in the 1960s, proposing joint teams for international athletic events. But sports diplomacy has never led to a lasting political thaw on the Korean Peninsula, which has remained technically in a state of war since the 1950-53 Korean War was halted with a truce. The two Koreas negotiated sharing some of the 1988 Seoul Olympics after South Korea won the right to play host to the Games. But the talks collapsed and the North bombed a South Korean passenger jet in 1987 in an attempt to disrupt the games in the South. Inter-Korean sports and other exchanges increased between 1998 and 2008, when the leaders of the South were pushing their so-called Sunshine Policy of seeking reconciliation and easing political tensions. But that period of détente, which gained momentum with the historic inter-Korean summit in 2000, unraveled as conservatives took power in the South in 2008. They withdrew from projects like a joint factory park in the North Korean town of Kaesong in response to the North’s nuclear weapons pursuit and other acts the South considered provocative.\1.8300338983535767,-0.1828898787498474,0.04523170366883278,-0.12452775239944458,-1.7152656316757202,-0.5363450050354004,2.2255523204803467,-0.9689578413963318,0.13114702701568604,-1.2084405422210693,0.91939377784729,1.722988247871399,1.368058681488037,0.9631308317184448,-1.9115469455718994,-0.021224860101938248,-1.4693018198013306,-0.5498331189155579,0.6211681962013245,-0.2377852350473404,-0.6089470386505127,0.15563127398490906,-0.33825793862342834,-0.11113926768302917,0.5682634115219116,-0.30266448855400085,0.3124438226222992,0.7664599418640137,0.38546428084373474,-1.0438110828399658,0.0034809729550033808,0.6200259327888489,-0.20319482684135437,-0.391321063041687,-1.2165871858596802,-0.13095025718212128,-1.079134225845337,-0.8138285279273987,1.4034662246704102,-0.9211499691009521,-0.5589852929115295,-1.1917047500610352,1.2902936935424805,-0.1658860146999359,-0.3339260220527649,1.9114645719528198,0.1865323930978775,1.2972893714904785,-2.4080145359039307,-0.49116840958595276,0.6445260643959045,1.3680393695831299,1.0098178386688232,-0.995655357837677,0.9677076935768127,-2.712740421295166,1.4491822719573975,-0.4734713137149811,-2.742163896560669,1.026782751083374,1.2646031379699707,0.8201248645782471,0.9759618043899536,-1.0335346460342407,-1.6938756704330444,1.3169387578964233,2.7242417335510254,0.7032956480979919,0.1765555739402771,0.8734608888626099,1.996391773223877,0.6221557259559631,-0.953557550907135,0.0043677231296896935,-0.9432637095451355,-0.6528406739234924,0.24077647924423218,-1.1024054288864136,-0.5920137763023376,-1.2765010595321655,1.1389782428741455,0.035474684089422226,-0.5496997237205505,-0.9235758781433105,1.8429557085037231,-0.8798734545707703,0.2710297703742981,-0.33775603771209717,-0.06400476396083832,-0.11002472788095474,-0.7882438898086548,0.9818114638328552,-2.2850332260131836,0.36963585019111633,-0.9419782161712646,0.15390916168689728,-1.1645171642303467,-1.2479217052459717,-0.35322320461273193,0.8407796025276184\NYTIMES\North and South Korean Teams to March as One at Olympics\2018-01-17 19:42:40.0\1574, 1768, 1788
1769\Politics\LONDON — The fate of thousands of workers hung in the balance on Wednesday after the collapse of Carillion, a major construction and services company that has a vast network of subcontractors and reaches deep into many facets of British life. Work has slowed on a range of Carillion projects, and some subcontractors, unsure if they will be paid or continue working, have begun curtailing assignments. The cracks appearing in Carillion’s sprawling network of services to the public and private sectors amplified fears that its failure could lead to the downfall of other companies that relied on it, putting tens of thousands of people out of work. The demise of Carillion, which entered liquidation on Monday, poses a political as well as economic challenge to the Conservative government of Prime Minister Theresa May, which declined to bail out the company. Even after it became clear last year that the company was in trouble, the government continued to award Carillion major contracts. “It looks like the government was handing Carillion public contracts either to keep the company afloat, which clearly hasn’t worked, or it was just deeply negligent of the crisis that was coming down the line,” Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said in Parliament on Wednesday. Mrs. May replied that if the government had withheld business from Carillion, “that would be the best way to ensure that companies failed and jobs were lost.” “We ensured that all but one of those contracts was a joint venture,” she added, meaning that “there is another company available to step in and take over the contract.” The Insolvency Service, a government agency, said on Wednesday that it had halted bonus and severance payments to former Carillion executives. The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the government was closely monitoring Interserve, another big construction and services company that has struggled financially, prompting a sharp drop in its share price. But Interserve, business analysts and the government all said that concerns about the company were overstated; in a statement, the Cabinet Office said, “We do not believe that any of our strategic suppliers are in a comparable position to Carillion.” Carillion, with about 20,000 employees in Britain, touched myriad sectors of British life, as well as operating overseas. It not only managed or co-managed major, unfinished construction projects for the government, like a high-speed rail link among English cities; a hospital near Birmingham; another hospital, in Liverpool; and a highway near Aberdeen, Scotland. Carillion also helped operate an array of government services, including running prisons, delivering school lunches, and maintaining schools and courthouses. The government has vowed that all public-sector work by Carillion will continue and that the company’s workers on those contracts will be paid, adding that other contractors were being sought to take over those jobs. But the government has said that it could not ensure that thousands of the company’s employees working on private-sector projects would be paid past Wednesday. “That’s a scandal,” Tim Roache, the leader of GMB, a major trade union, told BBC Radio. He said that the government should ensure a longer period of pay for those workers, while other companies explored taking on Carillion contracts and Carillion employees. The company had about $1.7 billion in debt and an $800 million pension deficit. By Monday, it had cash reserves of less than $40 million. Carillion’s subcontractors, who complained that the company was behind on its bills, face being paid only a small fraction of what they were owed before the collapse. Flora-tec, a landscaping company, said it would lay off 10 workers because it could never recoup most of the $1.3 million it was owed by Carillion. PwC, the firm handling the liquidation, has told the subcontractors, who employ tens of thousands in Britain, to continue working for now, pledging that “you will get paid for goods and services you supply” after Monday’s liquidation filing, but that those contracts could be terminated. “Over the coming days, we will review supplier contracts and we’ll contact you concerning these soon,” it said. But some subcontractors are leery of even the short-term assurances. Shaun Weeks, who runs a cleaning company, told the BBC that it had stopped sending one of its workers to a prison, under a contract with Carillion, until it knew more. At the construction site of the new Royal Liverpool University Hospital — where activity slowed sharply on Monday and some workers reported finding the site locked — work resumed on Tuesday, but some subcontractors said they expected delays as Carillion’s obligations were reviewed.\-0.1325053870677948,-0.015899259597063065,-0.2930991053581238,-0.49277177453041077,-0.7342678308486938,-0.39813682436943054,1.0900851488113403,0.5125690698623657,-0.24855546653270721,-0.8240591883659363,0.12012599408626556,-0.5492918491363525,-0.2710828185081482,-0.8878116607666016,-0.882654070854187,-0.5110167860984802,-0.10423246026039124,0.07745201140642166,0.5609683990478516,-0.31696727871894836,0.5208615660667419,0.037148572504520416,0.2767307460308075,-0.20256327092647552,-0.48485586047172546,0.5333579778671265,1.0016080141067505,-0.3582730293273926,-0.36417150497436523,1.3959181308746338,-0.6737082600593567,1.2055115699768066,-0.2808440029621124,-0.9956749677658081,-0.09674697369337082,-0.9055031538009644,0.3471858501434326,-1.2922461032867432,0.8371078968048096,-0.15765446424484253,-0.111776202917099,0.3125230371952057,0.4976593852043152,-1.1390330791473389,-1.435050129890442,-0.634822428226471,0.6268411874771118,-0.31285354495048523,-1.6632448434829712,-0.14146432280540466,-0.8256402015686035,-0.95304274559021,-0.3253236711025238,-0.37333381175994873,0.05797271057963371,0.04651034250855446,0.6772557497024536,-1.1219826936721802,-1.4814773797988892,1.1654709577560425,-0.378586083650589,-0.49184492230415344,0.6125349998474121,1.5646594762802124,-0.741434633731842,0.6379236578941345,-0.1688660979270935,0.7787891030311584,-0.8124235272407532,0.3818051517009735,0.26613563299179077,0.5175582766532898,0.2576506435871124,-0.7479005455970764,-0.3834955096244812,-0.09077492356300354,-0.2068125605583191,-0.17105653882026672,-0.6737241148948669,-0.6083260774612427,0.563044011592865,-0.6859412789344788,-0.8277184963226318,0.8079749941825867,0.9268262386322021,1.2397481203079224,-0.15284191071987152,-0.16692335903644562,0.19091591238975525,1.3991836309432983,0.588157057762146,0.8149136900901794,-0.4599868059158325,-0.062197547405958176,-0.14021195471286774,-0.34087759256362915,0.9268025755882263,-0.7770789861679077,-0.4596027135848999,1.6312859058380127\NYTIMES\Carillion Collapse Could Lead to Thousands of Job Losses in U.K.\2018-01-17 16:33:29.0\1769, 1832, 1839
1770\Politics\MELBOURNE, Australia — Shortly after Marta Kostyuk became the youngest woman to reach the third round of a Grand Slam in 21 years, she seemed to be struggling with the post-match interest in her precocious talent. “Scary,” Kostyuk, 15, said on Wednesday as she looked out at a crowded media room after advancing in the Australian Open. “But, O.K.” Kostyuk quickly adapted in typical fashion, demonstrating a sense of humility and self-awareness that belied her age. “I heard a lot of times that I’m talented, and I know that, but I know that only talent will not help me to play,” she said. “So I can say that I’m working pretty hard.” Kostyuk, ranked 521st, received a wild card into the qualifying draw after winning the junior title in Melbourne last year. She won three matches in the qualifying rounds to reach the main draw, and then opened the tournament with a victory over 25th-seeded Peng Shuai, 6-2, 6-2, in the first round on Monday. Consistency was a problem for Kostyuk on Wednesday, but she was able to beat another wild card, Olivia Rogowska, an Australian ranked No. 168 in the world, 6-3, 7-5. “I didn’t feel like she was 15 at all,” Rogowska said. “Power of her shots was up there. She served really well at times.” Kostyuk, who is from Ukraine, is managed by Ivan Ljubicic, who was once rose as high as No. 3 in the world rankings and also coaches Roger Federer. Her mother, Talina Beiko, also took up coaching after a professional career, which compelled Kostyuk to spend time on the court. “I wanted to see her a lot, so I was practicing,” Kostyuk said in an interview with WTA Insider. Beiko received a coaching violation during the match, a penalty that annoyed Kostyuk because she did not see whatever signal her mother was sending her. “I was so mad,” Kostyuk said, smiling. “But actually when I’m mad, it’s helping.” WTA rules dictate that 15-year-olds are limited to 10 tournaments, but her top-five finish in the junior rankings last year allows her to play in an additional two competitions. There will be time for her to contemplate her future schedule, but for now there is a more pressing issue: She will face fourth-seeded Elina Svitolina, the best women’s player Ukraine has produced, on Friday in the third round. Svitolina, 23, is coming off a title at the WTA tournament in Brisbane and would a prohibitive favorite under normal circumstances. Svitolina, however, said she has been struggling with unspecified “injury issues” before and during the tournament, and appeared unsure about her fitness. “It was, like, big question that I’m going to step on court for my first round,” Svitolina said in a news conference after her match on Wednesday. Although both are from Ukraine, the Zagreb-based Kostyuk and London-based Svitolina barely know each other. Svitolina said she heard of Kostyuk only after she won the junior title in Melbourne a year ago; Svitolina herself won the 2010 French Open girls’ title at 15. “I will just enjoy it,” Kostyuk said of the match against Svitolina. “I think I’m going to play on big court again, but I will just try to show my best tennis, because I’m pretty sure, like, all my opponents, she will struggle a little bit, and I will try to use this.” Although champions like Serena Williams, Martina Hingis and Steffi Graf won their first Grand Slam titles as teenagers, no player younger than 19 has captured a Grand Slam since Maria Sharapova won Wimbledon at 17 in 2004. The most recent teenager to make a major impact on tour was Belinda Bencic, who has struggled with injuries for the past year. Now healthy again, she beat Venus Williams in the first round on Monday before falling, 6-1, 6-3, to the qualifier Luksika Kumkhum on Wednesday. “Now I’m a veteran,” Bencic, 20, said with a laugh. Bencic first watched Kostyuk play on Wednesday, and she was impressed. “I hope for her that she continues like that, and keeps enjoying all of this, and remembers the feeling how it is when you’re excited the first time, first Grand Slam, and to keep it this way,” Bencic said. Bencic, who speaks from experience, said the most difficult thing for a highly praised teenager to deal with is the expectation of becoming an immediate champion. “You get really hyped, a lot, when you win one, two matches,” Bencic said. “Everybody focuses on you, there’s attention — and suddenly you’re the one who has to win. Which, it actually shouldn’t be like that.

Mr. Wong had pleaded guilty to contempt of court for refusing to obey a court order to leave a protest site in the last days of demonstrations, known as the Umbrella Movement, that paralyzed parts of Hong Kong without winning any political concession from the Chinese government. “They can lock up our bodies, but they cannot lock up our minds,” Mr. Wong, a leader of the political party Demosisto, told reporters outside the High Court in Hong Kong before his sentencing. The prison term dealt the latest blow to Mr. Wong, who was sentenced in August to six months in prison after he was found guilty of unlawful assembly. The city’s highest court, the Court of Final Appeal, began hearing an appeal of that prison term on Tuesday. Mr. Wong had served two months of his six-month sentence when the Court of Final Appeal granted him bail, pending the appeal. The imprisonment of Mr. Wong could galvanize support for his party, which is seeking to win a seat in the city’s Legislative Council in elections in March. Nathan Law, a member of the party previously elected to the legislature, was disqualified after the Beijing-backed local government sued him over his use of defiant words and tones when he took the oath of office. Mr. Wong, 21, rose to prominence as the face of the 2014 campaign against strict limits Beijing imposed on proposed voting changes in the former British colony. Mr. Wong and other protesters said those limits violated China’s promise to let people in Hong Kong elect the city’s leader through universal suffrage. In handing down the three-month sentence on Wednesday, Justice Andrew Chan of the High Court said the livelihood of ordinary citizens had been “adversely affected” by the protests in Mong Kok, a bustling commercial district, where Mr. Wong “played a leading role.” “The court had to intervene and protect not just the right of the protesters but also the right to live of the vast majority of the people,” Justice Chan wrote in his judgment. The High Court also sentenced Raphael Wong, a leader of another pro-democracy party, the League of Social Democrats, to four months and 15 days in prison. Fourteen other protesters were given lighter, suspended prison terms, which they will not be required to serve unless they commit a crime in the coming months. The two Mr. Wongs, who are not related, were immediately taken into custody after the sentencing.\0.9081249833106995,0.3612540066242218,-0.34609270095825195,0.381351500749588,0.4759637117385864,0.03289500251412392,0.8407284021377563,0.38673046231269836,-1.205431342124939,-0.9337061047554016,0.49528762698173523,0.6975049376487732,-0.044504616409540176,0.047950632870197296,-0.5049485564231873,-0.27866747975349426,0.25019150972366333,-0.16707821190357208,0.4935687184333801,0.221990704536438,1.093903660774231,0.24942314624786377,-0.31193768978118896,-0.7396115660667419,-0.5360802412033081,0.6214876770973206,0.7349748015403748,0.18202190101146698,0.26631152629852295,0.004324270412325859,-0.6215159893035889,0.530501663684845,0.2833453416824341,0.8479945063591003,0.5880387425422668,-0.5044128894805908,0.8126922249794006,0.46934932470321655,-0.2038138508796692,-0.530508816242218,-0.6179944276809692,-0.3994857668876648,-0.14415977895259857,-0.3382565379142761,0.6877263784408569,-0.062269177287817,0.23991839587688446,-0.44855669140815735,-1.5715137720108032,-1.0895609855651855,0.32985976338386536,-0.8369359970092773,0.507132887840271,0.656953752040863,0.04909197613596916,-0.33759310841560364,1.0531926155090332,-0.7257457375526428,-1.104507565498352,0.8204849362373352,0.3654654026031494,-0.2515147030353546,0.8250700235366821,0.5691147446632385,0.028337810188531876,-0.34345191717147827,0.683036208152771,0.9148552417755127,-0.5724942088127136,0.4749498963356018,0.8422894477844238,0.04022524133324623,0.2942345440387726,-0.3040856719017029,-0.7620948553085327,1.2584294080734253,0.20331251621246338,-0.16982506215572357,-1.008787751197815,0.012281631119549274,1.1556156873703003,-0.03958333656191826,-1.0891821384429932,-0.002013484016060829,0.508751392364502,0.796412467956543,0.771733820438385,0.13305670022964478,-0.7598154544830322,-0.07034673541784286,0.07227886468172073,1.0837923288345337,-1.5384482145309448,-0.38388755917549133,-0.07520731538534164,-0.19799357652664185,-0.08686048537492752,0.0420525036752224,-0.9706228375434875,-0.048565737903118134\NYTIMES\Joshua Wong Sentenced in Hong Kong for Role in Umbrella Movement\2018-01-17 10:17:38.0\
1772\Politics\WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is withholding more than half the funding that the United States generally has provided to a United Nations agency that aids Palestinian refugees, officials said Tuesday. Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, said the United States would provide $60 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency but would withhold $65 million “for future consideration.” Ms. Nauert said that the decision was intended to encourage other countries to increase aid, as well as to promote reform at the relief agency — and that it was not intended to be a punitive move against Palestinians. But she refused to comment when asked if the funding shortfall was linked to President Trump’s threat on Jan. 2 to end the aid after Palestinian leaders said the United States should no longer play a role in peace talks with Israel. The withholding was denounced by the Palestinians and welcomed by Israel. “Once again, the U.S. administration proves its complicity with the Israeli occupation by attempting to remove another permanent status issue off the table,” said Hanan Ashrawi of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s executive committee. Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, said the United Nations Relief and Works Agency “has proven time and again to be an agency that misuses the humanitarian aid of the international community and instead supports anti-Israel propaganda, perpetuates the plight of Palestinian refugees and encourages hate.” The agency funds schools and health clinics that serve nearly two million people in Lebanon, Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. As funding declined recently, the agency began significant layoffs of teachers and health workers, many of them refugees themselves. Mr. Trump has turned American policy sharply in favor of Israel and against the Palestinians. He has formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and threatened to close the Palestine Liberation Organization’s diplomatic mission in Washington. The United States provided more than $355 million to support the relief agency’s 2016 operations, and also gave about $290 million last year to the Palestinians through the United States Agency for International Development. Altogether, the United States has provided about $5.2 billion in assistance to the Palestinians since 1994, a level of funding that is likely to be reduced in the coming years as the Trump administration works to cut foreign assistance. Tuesday’s announced cut alarmed United Nations officials and aid groups that regard the United Nations Relief and Works Agency as a critical pillar of well-being for Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and Gaza and in neighboring countries. The Norwegian Refugee Council, which works in more than 30 countries, urged the Trump administration to reconsider, saying that the funding reduction will have “devastating consequences for vulnerable Palestinian refugees across the Middle East.” At the United Nations, Secretary General António Guterres said he was “very concerned” about any cuts to the agency. He said the relief agency’s services were of “extreme importance” to the populations of Palestinians who had lived as refugees for 70 years. Mr. Guterres said that was not only his opinion but “an opinion that is shared by most international observers, including some Israeli ones.” Many Israelis worry that any rapid reduction in such aid could destabilize the region and force Israel to pick up a larger share of the costs. Jordan, where many Palestinians have settled, is also coping with a huge influx of Syrian refugees. “That the Trump administration is using humanitarian aid for schools and hospitals as a cudgel to punish those who disagree with their policy decisions is deeply troubling,” said Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of J Street, a Washington-based liberal advocacy group for peace in the region. Robert B. Satloff, executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said he was “not a fan of massive cuts” to funding for the relief agency, saying he would prefer other solutions, such as changes to how Palestinians become eligible for refugee status. United Nations funding for Palestinian refugees grows in part out of a longtime assumption that a Palestinian state would eventually be created. But cuts to that funding, along with other efforts that dim hopes for a two-state solution, could accelerate a shift among younger Palestinians to abandon the push for a separate state and instead demand full civil rights from Israel. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and a top adviser, is quietly continuing an effort to find a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that experts hope will at least persuade Palestinians not to suddenly end many accommodations with Israel. “It is proximity that almost guarantees a continued accommodation,” said Aaron David Miller of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, who was a State Department Middle East analyst and negotiator in Republican and Democratic administrations. “The proximity also guarantees tension. That’s the paradox here.”\0.21336837112903595,0.6647406220436096,-0.9084027409553528,-0.4080144166946411,0.1254548728466034,-1.3938467502593994,-0.13206747174263,-0.7388397455215454,-0.5993641018867493,-0.8923859000205994,0.5909736156463623,0.8160030245780945,0.36091145873069763,0.9809948801994324,-0.22220858931541443,1.3066949844360352,-0.4534805715084076,-0.8141544461250305,0.3024926781654358,0.6862071752548218,-0.627540111541748,-0.7048245668411255,-0.8066418766975403,-0.5113968253135681,-0.009434442035853863,0.2820397615432739,0.2524281144142151,-0.0038472411688417196,-0.35379743576049805,-0.4795790910720825,-0.8301214575767517,0.804368793964386,-1.2873823642730713,-0.6890230178833008,-0.2060537338256836,-0.7821983695030212,0.053849805146455765,0.35946324467658997,-0.2917977571487427,-0.524060845375061,-0.7505778074264526,-1.1764811277389526,-0.6363630890846252,0.42568469047546387,0.20924173295497894,-0.3421882092952728,-0.134599506855011,1.1658189296722412,-0.31767135858535767,-0.28612086176872253,1.0307457447052002,-0.6697192788124084,0.5255731344223022,-0.47654059529304504,1.1448572874069214,-1.6256359815597534,0.9031646847724915,-0.04166048765182495,-2.2910943031311035,1.1730022430419922,-0.9976056218147278,0.016492947936058044,0.31859272718429565,0.16913902759552002,-0.6956443786621094,0.14044342935085297,0.4146134555339813,1.5421642065048218,0.1401171088218689,0.9853653311729431,1.0476888418197632,-0.2649712562561035,0.47763678431510925,-0.14021724462509155,-1.5731451511383057,-1.140242576599121,0.42908722162246704,0.14476656913757324,-0.4891728460788727,-0.5825650691986084,0.8011359572410583,1.1478915214538574,-0.5348738431930542,-1.0193524360656738,-0.2066434919834137,0.20278368890285492,-0.1502852588891983,-0.8576012849807739,-0.3011091947555542,-1.2796580791473389,-0.37125906348228455,1.5976958274841309,-1.5245078802108765,-0.6624587178230286,-0.8874756097793579,-0.36250045895576477,0.722802460193634,-0.7188466191291809,-0.45926350355148315,0.3796069324016571\NYTIMES\U.S. Withholds $65 Million From U.N.

1773\Politics\BEIRUT, Lebanon — A plan to create a new American-backed, Kurdish-led border force in northeastern Syria has raised alarms in the region that the United States may be helping to cement an autonomous Kurdish enclave that could further divide the country. The 30,000-strong force, vehemently opposed by Russia, Turkey, Iran and the Syrian government, could also ignite a new phase in the war that could pit American allies against one another and draw the United States deeper into the conflict. While Kurdish and American officials sought to tamp down the controversy on Tuesday, insisting that the force was really nothing new, they confirmed some of the fears. They said the border force will help defend and preserve the section of northeastern Syria controlled by the Kurdish-led, United States-backed militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, an area that has become a de facto semiautonomous zone. And they said that the United States was committed to backing the force for at least two years. The force will be essentially a restructured version of the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., its spokesman, Mostafa Bali, said Tuesday. He said the fighters would be “professionally well trained as border guards,” and would deploy along parts of Syria’s borders with Turkey and Iraq to prevent an Islamic State resurgence, which he called “a moral duty.” It would also, he said, hold the line between S.D.F.-held territory and areas held by Syrian government forces, roughly along the Euphrates River. The territory includes large swaths of land captured from the Islamic State by the S.D.F., the Kurdish and Arab militia that has been the United States’ main partner in Syria against the militant group. But there has never been agreement on what would happen to that territory once the Islamic State was vanquished. The Kurdish party that dominates the S.D.F. has always said the territory would remain as a self-governing part of a federalized Syria. American officials have said the United States would continue to support its allies in Syria, but they have been vague about how and for how long. The new force suggested a possible answer to that question. But the Syrian government and its allies Russia and Iran object to any division of the country. So do most Syrian opposition groups. The government led by President Bashar al-Assad wants to re-establish control over all of Syria and objects to American tinkering outside of a negotiated peace deal. Perhaps the angriest protests have come from Turkey, an American ally and NATO member. Turkey opposes the Syrian government, but considers the Kurds a dangerous enemy and fervently objects to a semiautonomous Syrian Kurdish entity bordering its own Kurdish areas, where it is fighting Kurdish insurgents. Turkey has threatened to invade another Syrian Kurdish enclave, called Afrin, as soon as Wednesday. American analysts offered sharply diverging views on the significance of the new force, its impact on any potential peace plan, and how it fits into broader American policy on Syria. “This is about making sure that ISIS is truly defeated and the conditions for its regeneration are eliminated,” said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria specialist at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “This isn’t to create a Kurdistan or an enclave in the long term.” But Joshua M. Landis, a Syria specialist at the University of Oklahoma, said in an email that the United States was effectively “backing an independent state north of the Euphrates River,” one that controls a large portion of Syria’s oil and gas reserves and its main electric dam and that has its own army and Kurdish-language school curriculum. “It will become a de facto Kurdish-run state should the U.S. continue to protect and fund it,” he said. Although the Americans have committed to protecting the area for two years, it remains to be seen if they will, or what would happen after that. Russia, Iran, Turkey and the government in Damascus have all demonstrated that they are more invested, militarily and politically, to shaping the outcome in Syria than is the United States. Mr. Landis said the force could be less about a long-term commitment to the Kurds than a fig leaf for a continued American presence to counter Iran’s forces there. Given those uncertainties, the Kurds are hedging their bets. They have worked not only with Americans but also, increasingly openly, with the Russians. By keeping channels open to the Russians, analysts and officials say, they gain leverage over the United States and Turkey, and an escape hatch to reconcile with the Syrian government if all else fails. On Tuesday, American and Kurdish officials sought to calm worries, saying that the troops will not be entirely Kurdish but their ethnic makeup will reflect the areas where they are stationed. “These forces are not a threat against anybody,” including Turkey, Mr. Bali, the S.D.F. spokesman said. He said the enclave would not break Syria apart but would be part of a new, more decentralized or federalized Syria. He said it would not be based on Kurdish ethnicity but would be a government for an area of northeastern Syria that includes Arabs, Armenians, and Syriacs. “Syria should be a united federation, like those of the United States and Russia,” said Abdelkareem Omar, a Syrian Kurdish official. “The vision we have of Syria does not in any way threaten the unity of Syria, nor the safety and security of countries in the vicinity.” Col. Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the American-led military coalition in Baghdad, said the United States could have explained the plan more clearly to avoid alarming allies, but that it was simply a logical next step from the local security forces that S.D.F. has created in areas taken from the Islamic State. “We’ve established internal security forces,” Colonel Dillon said. “This is the same for border areas.” But Turkey considers the new force a terrorist army and has promised to destroy it, risking a new round of fighting. Such a conflict could pit American allies — Turkey, some Syrian Arab rebels, and the Kurdish-led force — against one another, further muddling an already murky American policy in Syria. Kurdish forces have not fought the Syrian government much, mainly policing their territory and fighting the Islamic State, although they may later have to choose between fighting government forces and losing their de facto autonomy. Several Syrian rebel groups, including some once backed by the United States, now work directly with Turkey. Last year, they seized an area along the Turkish border that separates the main Kurdish-held area from the smaller enclave, Afrin, which is now threatened with a similar incursion. The dispute is creating new bumps in the already rocky road to a negotiated settlement for the war. Preparations are underway for a new United Nations-led round of talks next week and a Russian-hosted Syrian dialogue conference in February in Sochi. But there is no agreement in any of the ongoing talks about the future of the Kurdish areas. Denied a separate Kurdish delegation at the United Nations-sponsored Geneva talks, Kurdish groups have been trying to get one in Sochi. But Turkey says it will pull out if Russia grants that request. Kurdish officials say that in a compromise, they will send 40 delegates to Sochi representing not the Kurdish ethnic group but the S.D.F.-held locally governed area. Meanwhile, the government led by Mr. Assad has shown no interest in decentralization, or in any reforms at all. But Kurdish officials say they are determined. “It won’t go back to how it was before 2011 after all this,” Mr. Omar, the Kurdish official, said. Another Kurdish official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to comment on the matter, said the Kurds would not bow to Turkey or to the Syrian government. With rebel groups divided, he said, the S.D.F. is the last coherent force left to push for change.\0.937163770198822,0.9039673805236816,-1.079246997833252,0.126442089676857,-0.8401090502738953,-0.5230555534362793,1.8752622604370117,-1.5909157991409302,-0.6430802345275879,-0.7770405411720276,0.4474652111530304,1.4844529628753662,-0.9507697820663452,-0.17902988195419312,-1.0726546049118042,0.4695374369621277,0.02232930064201355,-1.133149266242981,-0.697039783000946,0.3502001166343689,-0.04131333902478218,-0.8131068348884583,-0.4507905840873718,0.44885164499282837,-0.48444080352783203,0.822959840297699,1.0348997116088867,1.4637597799301147,0.3025501072406769,0.10171039402484894,-0.13353238999843597,1.983717441558838,0.004738703370094299,0.630233645439148,-0.9127171039581299,-1.0207828283309937,-1.0469820499420166,-1.7718473672866821,-0.16735374927520752,-2.0657243728637695,-1.9617345333099365,-2.8620641231536865,0.39530521631240845,-0.20071180164813995,-0.36268937587738037,0.46533694863319397,-0.7612305283546448,0.43697184324264526,-1.1347203254699707,0.8505743145942688,-0.01148644182831049,0.05521291494369507,1.3393135070800781,1.0926858186721802,1.1559346914291382,0.902393639087677,2.6528921127319336,0.2375738024711609,-1.924475908279419,0.640661358833313,0.7230862975120544,0.9353876709938049,0.3753218352794647,0.3798931837081909,-2.522797107696533,0.5841073989868164,1.8663506507873535,1.4605225324630737,-0.693187415599823,1.663744568824768,1.0645345449447632,0.9058136940002441,-0.46502673625946045,0.6950240731239319,-1.738774299621582,-0.927230179309845,0.8641371726989746,0.755405843257904,-1.1856966018676758,-1.8174470663070679,0.44431376457214355,-0.22881220281124115,-2.1026363372802734,-0.3904029428958893,0.1621108204126358,0.3176608383655548,1.5357695817947388,-0.0357603020966053,0.7081303596496582,0.18282045423984528,-1.7830097675323486,1.1700165271759033,-0.8498979806900024,-1.6644989252090454,0.36592257022857666,0.23240099847316742,0.15167775750160217,0.8905977606773376,-2.2288999557495117,1.5345172882080078\NYTIMES\U.S.-Backed Force Could Cement a Kurdish Enclave in Syria\2018-01-17 11:53:36.0\
1774\Politics\(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Stephen Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, has been called to testify before a grand jury — the latest twist in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. This is the first time the special counsel, Robert Mueller, is known to have used a grand jury subpoena to question a member of Mr. Trump’s inner circle. It could be a negotiating tactic, or a sign that Mr. Bannon is not the focus of the investigation. ____ 2. A Senate hearing meant to be a long-awaited discussion of border walls turned into an impromptu interrogation about the words President Trump used — or did not use — last week to describe African countries. “I don’t dispute that the president was using tough language,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security secretary, above, but she denied hearing Mr. Trump call African nations “shithole countries.” The Trump administration, meanwhile, bolstered its hard-line immigration stance with a report that concluded that three out of four convicted terrorists in the U.S. were foreign-born. Ms. Nielsen called the data “truly chilling.” But the statistics were notable as much for what they did not contain as for what they did. ____ 3. President Trump’s overall health was “excellent,” the White House physician said after a medical exam. But the president’s weight is 239 pounds and, according to the doctor, he does not get enough exercise. “I’ve found no reason whatsoever to think the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought processes,” the physician said. And Mr. Trump will need that mental stamina: A government shutdown could come at the end of this week if Congress doesn’t reach a deal on a spending bill. We clarify what’s at stake for lawmakers in both parties. _____ 4. Another false missile alarm, this time in Japan. Just days after the state government of Hawaii accidentally sent a cellphone alert that North Korea had launched a missile and that citizens should take shelter — Japan’s public broadcaster did the same thing. One big difference: It took Hawaii nearly 40 minutes to correct the mistake; in Japan it took five. _____ 5. A shocking story emerged from Southern California, where the police reported finding a group of siblings held captive, some in chains, by their own parents, above. The discovery came after one sibling, a girl, escaped and called the police, who rescued her 12 brothers and sisters, some shackled to their beds. The officers did not immediately realize that seven of the siblings were adults because they were emaciated. In fact, they range in age from 2 to 29. The girl who called the police, officials said, looked to be 10, but was actually 17. _____ 6. From our Op-Ed desk: An article published by a feminist website that accuses the actor and comedian Aziz Ansari of sexual misconduct is “arguably the worst thing that has happened to the #MeToo movement,” our columnist writes. To lump a lousy romantic encounter in with the same movement that brought down men who abused their power “trivializes what #MeToo first stood for,” she said. _____ 7. Oil briefly passed $70 a barrel and there is no shortage of reasons for the prices to climb higher. And U.S. banks are big winners in the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul. And in another win for banks, the Senate is poised to roll back regulations that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Separately, it was a bad day for General Electric, which took on a $6.2 billion charge to pay for problems in its finance unit. _____ 8. Yes, the bitcoin bubble is driven by greed — but the fever for cryptocurrency could eventually create something much more important than wealth. (Even if it’s a bit complicated.) To investigate, we went inside the newly megarich cryptocurrency community. We found a tightknit group of friends — developers, libertarians, Redditors and cypherpunks — who talk about changing the world order. _____ 9. Like a lot of Philip Roth fans, our literary critic wondered what the author of “American Pastoral,” “I Married a Communist” and “The Plot Against America” makes of this strange period we are living in now. Here, in this exclusive interview, the (former) novelist shares his thoughts on President Trump, #MeToo and retirement. And here’s another tribute to Dolores O’Riordan, above, the lead singer of the Irish rock band the Cranberries who died on Monday in London. _____ 10. Finally, late night hosts like Stephen Colbert, above, and Jimmy Fallon weren’t about to let President Trump’s reported remarks about Haiti and certain African countries go away. Mr. Fallon had this to say: “Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci defended Trump, saying, ‘At the end of the day, he’s not a racist.’ Then he said, ‘During the day, it’s a different story.’” Have a great night. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.

1775\Politics\MOSCOW — A court on Tuesday extended the house arrest of Kirill S. Serebrennikov, the artistic director of the Gogol Center, whose case has raised alarms about repression of artistic freedom in Russia. Mr. Serebrennikov is accused of embezzling government funds that had been allocated for one of his theatrical projects. The ruling means he will spend another three months under house arrest while awaiting trial. Earlier this month, investigators reportedly elevated their accusations against Mr. Serebrennikov in a draft of an indictment, saying his theater company, Seventh Studio, had embezzled almost twice as much as they had initially suspected. He and his associates are now accused of stealing the ruble equivalent of $2.3 million. The Ministry of Culture has been recognized as an injured party in the case, and has asked to be awarded the same sum as compensation if Mr. Serebrennikov is convicted. The case has set off alarms in the artistic community in Russia about the prospect of a return of censorship to the arts. Mr. Serebrennikov has staged plays featuring nude actors and touching on socially divisive issues of sexuality and politics. Russian cultural figures have repeatedly raised the case with President Vladimir V. Putin in meetings but he has declined to intervene. He has said that nobody is immune from legal prosecution in Russia and pointed out that the Bolshoi Theater recently staged “Nureyev,” a ballet directed by Mr. Serebrennikov about Rudolf Nureyev, a gay ballet dancer who defected from the Soviet Union. “If this were a persecution, not a prosecution, his performance wouldn’t have been staged at the Bolshoi,” Mr. Putin said in December. Speaking in court on Tuesday, Mr. Serebrennikov said that his accountant at Seventh Studio, Nina L. Maslyaeva, who has turned state’s witness in the case, had falsely accused him and four colleagues of theft. In the testimony, published by a Russian-language news portal, Meduza, Mr. Serebrennikov suggested that the topics touched upon during pretrial interrogations in November and December were completely unrelated to the essence of the case. He recalled being questioned about a theater director’s duties and saying that the job involved “being a genius, inspiring the people and staging highly artistic performances” — after which the interrogation was over.\0.5425733923912048,-0.5637816786766052,-0.6116032004356384,-0.5745227336883545,0.11674001812934875,-0.23722872138023376,0.333055704832077,0.20425938069820404,-1.2517585754394531,-1.001740574836731,0.697567343711853,0.6985369324684143,0.12490727007389069,0.015399174764752388,0.02338729240000248,0.16661834716796875,0.03035847283899784,0.021627550944685936,0.6154350638389587,0.1677924543619156,-0.4542648196220398,-0.4727698266506195,-0.4790668487548828,-0.7249335646629333,-0.31953164935112,-0.2583625912666321,0.005372520070523024,0.4585162103176117,-0.1629370152950287,0.0192023366689682,0.2534947097301483,0.4433770477771759,-0.2229757308959961,0.16646713018417358,-0.6116009950637817,-0.05520729348063469,0.035418879240751266,-0.589336097240448,-0.5916834473609924,-0.20100238919258118,-0.4035700559616089,-1.2063124179840088,0.6806277632713318,-0.035378143191337585,0.1631649136543274,-0.015506252646446228,0.22655443847179413,0.32360386848449707,-1.7017029523849487,-0.5325573682785034,0.804259181022644,-1.2513481378555298,-0.3241400122642517,0.5257772207260132,1.4108147621154785,-0.35077038407325745,1.1127665042877197,-0.3512990474700928,-0.9905312657356262,0.5963009595870972,-0.36050307750701904,0.08695674687623978,0.6796717643737793,0.30449771881103516,-0.5262086391448975,-0.03798011690378189,0.6721237301826477,0.9520774483680725,-1.2555291652679443,0.3642151653766632,-0.50719153881073,-0.14547380805015564,-0.4732889235019684,-0.8017248511314392,-0.835877537727356,-0.30832698941230774,0.21387307345867157,1.1178605556488037,-1.514142394065857,0.05163218826055527,1.3882304430007935,0.08470605313777924,-0.8026381134986877,0.13401585817337036,0.4239629805088043,0.8691104650497437,0.6342482566833496,0.5024402737617493,0.6012653112411499,0.07038955390453339,0.5223610401153564,1.3390384912490845,-1.019926905632019,-0.5029868483543396,-0.8778428435325623,-0.16287608444690704,-0.15210802853107452,-0.932140052318573,-0.6237936019897461,0.27906766533851624\NYTIMES\Russian Theater Director’s House Arrest Is Extended\2018-01-17 16:26:54.0\
1776\Politics\Pope Francis said on Tuesday that he was “pained and ashamed” over the “irreparable damage” priests had inflicted on minors, as he offered Chileans an apology during his first visit to their country as pontiff. “It is just to ask for forgiveness and to support victims with as much strength as possible, even as we take steps to ensure that this never happens again,” the pope said during an address in Santiago, Chile’s capital, attended by President Michelle Bachelet. The remarks were the pope’s latest effort to contain the fallout from a series of sexual abuse scandals that have contributed to the decline of Catholicism in several regions, including Latin America. But victims of sexual abuse by members of the clergy in Chile said the pope’s words rang hollow. “It’s not the time for apologies anymore; it’s the time for action,” said Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean who was abused by a priest when he was a 17-year-old seminarian. “Here in Chile there are bishops who have witnessed abuse and who have covered that up and who have abused as well and they are still in their position. The pope should remove them.” Francis made his apology during an address at the Chilean presidential palace in the morning, standing alongside Ms. Bachelet, an atheist. Francis, an Argentine, said he was pleased to “be on Latin American soil again” and paid tribute to democracy in Chile, which held a presidential election last month. He did not mention abortion rights, same-sex marriage or gender identity, three issues over which Chilean lawmakers have sparred in recent months. But he called on Chile to “listen to migrants who are knocking on the door of this country in search of a better life, and at the same time, with the strength and hope to build a better future for all.” The pope also championed indigenous rights ahead of a visit on Wednesday to a region in southern Chile that has become embroiled in the Mapuche indigenous people’s fight to reclaim ancestral lands. The speech was interrupted by bursts of applause, but the pope drew criticism for what he did next. After leaving the presidential palace, Francis celebrated Mass in Santiago alongside Bishop Juan Barros Madrid of Osorno, a city in southern Chile. Bishop Barros has been accused of protecting the Rev. Fernando Karadima, a former priest who was defrocked by the Vatican for abusing teenagers during the 1980s and 1990s. The pope has been criticized for elevating Father Barros to bishop in 2015 despite being aware of the allegations against him. “The criticism was heard loud and clear,” said Marta Lagos, a political analyst who recently oversaw a study on the decline of Catholicism in Latin America, where evangelical denominations have cut into the Roman Catholic Church’s base. “How can he ask for forgiveness and then offer a Mass with him, a bishop accused of having been an accomplice” to abuse? Anne Barrett Doyle, the co-director of BishopAccountability.org, a group that tracks abuse cases in the church, said the pope’s remarks in Santiago were “strong but familiar.” Francis last year acknowledged that the church had been slow to respond to allegations of abuse and said that “pedophilia is a sickness.” Ms. Doyle, whose group last week published a database of nearly 80 Chilean clergymen who have been accused of abuse, said she hoped the pope would commit to undertaking a sweeping investigation of past cases. “If the pope leaves Chile without committing to investigate complicit church leaders, the public’s already deep distrust of the church will intensify,” Ms. Doyle said. Catholicism has lost millions of followers in Latin America in recent years. The decline in Chile has been among the steepest. Between 1995 and last year, the number of Chileans who described themselves as Catholic dropped to 45 percent from 74 percent, according to a poll conducted by Latinobarómetro, which Ms. Lagos runs. The poll had a margin of error of 2.8 to 3 percentage points. Mr. Cruz, the abuse victim, said the pope’s decision to offer Mass alongside Bishop Barros brought into sharp focus why many across Latin America had turned away from the church. “That is such a terrible sign and an incoherent signal to survivors,” he said, calling it “the reason Chile has lost so much faith in the hierarchy and we have become a much less Catholic country.”\1.1525341272354126,0.9648705124855042,-0.27105259895324707,0.5866289734840393,0.007519837468862534,-0.2591775357723236,0.5130331516265869,-0.35705307126045227,-0.830890417098999,-0.885174572467804,-0.6850605010986328,0.5611335039138794,0.16016069054603577,0.8977768421173096,0.1864364594221115,0.20426903665065765,-0.47416549921035767,-0.2550022304058075,0.8060428500175476,-0.4038320779800415,-0.5062260627746582,0.29143089056015015,0.6693054437637329,0.43878230452537537,-1.0213606357574463,0.35278910398483276,0.43823397159576416,-0.15727955102920532,0.08380639553070068,-0.5149988532066345,-0.180569589138031,0.09264753013849258,-0.09921345114707947,0.6163886785507202,0.1885882318019867,-0.5039471983909607,-0.0588407889008522,0.36154404282569885,-0.26890093088150024,-0.7875667214393616,-0.9491541981697083,-1.0357168912887573,0.2223842740058899,-0.39633843302726746,0.4639764428138733,0.5908076763153076,0.6190111637115479,0.6611953973770142,-1.53977370262146,-0.03963556885719299,1.187435269355774,-0.20236365497112274,-0.7908138632774353,-0.12142592668533325,0.7073450684547424,-1.0943717956542969,0.6481460928916931,-0.6647448539733887,-1.4787592887878418,1.0816141366958618,0.05593317747116089,0.5157685875892639,-0.16142775118350983,0.1570579707622528,-0.9920984506607056,1.0187174081802368,0.47458890080451965,0.803199291229248,-0.8019769191741943,0.5146806836128235,0.8529455661773682,0.3161168694496155,-0.9078359603881836,0.24745090305805206,-0.9061137437820435,-0.0594308003783226,0.654757022857666,0.6735533475875854,-0.5560362339019775,-0.11492215096950531,0.21451659500598907,0.07279140502214432,-1.2021658420562744,1.100963830947876,0.4168948531150818,0.3082156777381897,0.40960338711738586,1.3367160558700562,0.014369453303515911,0.6328038573265076,-0.15270556509494781,0.5299266576766968,-1.607262372970581,0.9310036897659302,-0.2599142789840698,0.37501025199890137,0.6539405584335327,0.10017304867506027,0.07434235513210297,1.0026978254318237\NYTIMES\In Chile, Pope Francis Apologizes for ‘Irreparable Damage’ Caused by Sexual Abuse\2018-01-17 05:56:00.0\1751, 1776
1777\Politics\CALAIS, France — President Emmanuel Macron of France on Tuesday came to Calais, the port city at the center of France’s migrant problem, to defend his policies as a mix of benevolence and firmness against critics who have accused him of inhumanity. With France receiving a record number of asylum claims — 100,000 last year — Mr. Macron has been under increasing fire, especially from the left, for betraying France’s values. His interior minister has been criticized for promoting searches of illegal migrants in emergency shelters and stepping up deportations. Police have been accused of ripping blankets away from freezing migrants. Even members of Mr. Macron’s own cultlike political movement, La République en Marche, have expressed uneasiness with their leader for the first time. On Tuesday, Mr. Macron fought back. But typically for the French president, he sought a middle ground, doling out favors and brickbats on both sides. He vowed that Calais, the bedraggled port that is a focal point for migrants hoping to reach England, would never again be a dumping ground for them. “Under no circumstances will we allow the Jungle to come back,” he told the officers, referring to the squalid encampment that once housed over 8,000 migrants near here, and that was torn down by Mr. Macron’s predecessor in the fall of 2016. He chastised charitable organizations for encouraging “these men and women to settle, in an illegal status.” There are still some 600 migrants — mostly young Eritreans, Sudanese and Afghans — in and around Calais, camping out in the underbrush and scattering at the approach of the police. Still, they are invisible in the struggling town itself, where before knots of two or three were ever-present. But Mr. Macron, at times sounding defensive, seemed most at pains to reassure his critics on the left in his speech Tuesday, in a frigid and drafty hangar at a windswept police barracks in Calais. The president is not used to being accused of inhumanity, but that has been the tenor of a weekslong barrage in the media here. His face appeared on the cover of this week’s widely read magazine L’Obs encased in barbed wire; inside, a host of well-known writers took savage aim at him. In Le Monde on Tuesday, leading intellectuals, including a one-time top adviser and the head of a top think tank, accused him of having “broken with the humanism you advocated.” So on Tuesday Mr. Macron’s most pointed words were for the police officers who listened to him in stony silence, and did not applaud him at the end. The unspoken message to them: be gentle. It was an unusual admonition in the French context — a head of state chiding national law enforcement, with which a French president usually tries to closely identify. “These are human beings to whom we have a duty of humanity,” the French president said Tuesday. “You need to be exemplary, and you need to respect the dignity of each individual,” he said. Don’t allow people to have “the idea that you are practicing physical violence,” Mr. Macron said. “If there are failings, they will be sanctioned, proportional to the confidence we have in you,” he warned. A Human Rights Watch report last summer was severely critical of police treatment of migrants at Calais, pointing to the systematic use of stinging spray and destruction of migrants’ goods. Mr. Macron, without endorsing the letter of that report Tuesday, appeared to acknowledge its spirit. His government is in the midst of preparing a new policy, focused on distinguishing between those who seek to establish themselves in France for economic reasons — the overwhelming majority, especially among those from Africa — and those fleeing persecution. He wants to send those in the first category home, and indeed such returns were up 16 percent last year. Still, the overwhelming majority of migrants stay in France, dispersed across “welcome centers,” waiting months for their applications to be decided on, or simply fleeing from them — some 37 percent. His rightward drift on the issue has been strategic, outflanking the far-right National Front as well as the more traditional right. The National Front has made illegal immigration its signature issue, and Mr. Macron knows that its constituency in France remains large, if dormant for the moment. Marine Le Pen, the party’s leader, has been less critical of Mr. Macron than the left has on the subject of migrants. But the president’s warnings to the police Tuesday may give her an opening. A Franco-British summit on Thursday is certain to take up migrant issues, as Mr. Macron suggested Tuesday — especially the thorny one of unaccompanied minors trying to reach Britain and stuck in Calais. Pushing back at his critics on the left, Mr. Macron insisted Tuesday that considerable resources were being devoted to the hosting of migrants, “a reality behind these figures, a budgetary commitment,” including 20,000 housing units for refugees. On Tuesday he went a step further, saying the state would “take on” the feeding of migrants at Calais, long a sore point for the charitable associations that now perform the task. Earlier, Mr. Macron had met with migrants at a reception center in the small town of Croisilles, south of Calais. He engaged in an almost tender exchange with one, a young Sudanese man named Ahmed, as reported by a pool reporter for Agence France-Presse who was allowed to witness the scene. “Have you made friends here?” the president asked Ahmed, according to the pool reporter. “It takes a lot of willpower to try to learn French,” Ahmed said. “We are going to help you,” Mr. Macron said, putting his hand on Ahmed’s shoulder. “And I believe that what you have said so far speaks to a case requiring asylum,” Mr. Macron said. At which Ahmed smiled.\0.434643417596817,-0.604195773601532,-1.5682352781295776,1.0216569900512695,-0.053887221962213516,-0.8036038279533386,1.5217256546020508,-0.7098052501678467,-0.428856760263443,-1.341748833656311,-0.048207156360149384,0.15609624981880188,-0.4523334801197052,1.424908995628357,-0.3359346091747284,0.6614549160003662,-0.17085735499858856,1.332262396812439,0.940138041973114,-0.2961866557598114,-0.42397668957710266,-0.6648530960083008,-0.40314728021621704,0.45813870429992676,-0.8587827682495117,0.39753323793411255,1.534964680671692,1.1407041549682617,0.7981500625610352,-0.6154115796089172,-0.34379422664642334,0.5875470638275146,0.377297043800354,-0.2886946201324463,0.15005004405975342,0.16961555182933807,0.014470928348600864,-0.6734186410903931,0.26175427436828613,-1.3419736623764038,-0.08962880820035934,-1.3667529821395874,-0.03347409516572952,-0.8725720047950745,-0.13482964038848877,-0.783194899559021,-0.3276611268520355,0.5210005640983582,-1.337662696838379,-0.126770481467247,1.1343797445297241,-0.6486406922340393,0.03887315094470978,-0.11495839804410934,1.996623158454895,-1.2570102214813232,2.633592128753662,0.9393799901008606,-2.016535997390747,1.1795555353164673,-0.9090450406074524,0.6807345747947693,0.25663822889328003,-1.0240867137908936,-1.1495418548583984,1.0418275594711304,1.231753945350647,1.8679636716842651,-0.5184972882270813,1.5405864715576172,0.40398794412612915,0.22384686768054962,-0.37689995765686035,0.7338901162147522,-1.0664740800857544,-0.1063043549656868,0.004116653464734554,-0.5614708065986633,-1.2820957899093628,-1.1635186672210693,0.6404132843017578,-0.48801666498184204,-1.0661526918411255,0.4794142544269562,0.32527387142181396,-0.652125895023346,0.08180186152458191,0.4884304106235504,0.9050041437149048,0.3501962721347809,-0.282209575176239,0.3757188022136688,-0.9973206520080566,-0.06776580214500427,-0.8243959546089172,0.2247285395860672,-0.37760820984840393,-1.2138473987579346,-0.32249680161476135,0.7301236391067505\NYTIMES\Macron Defends Migration Policy in France, Walking a Fine Line\2018-01-17 00:51:59.0\
1778\Politics\MEDELLÍN, Colombia — Óscar Pérez, a helicopter pilot and former police officer who led an armed rebel band against the isolated and embattled government of Venezuela, was killed in a shootout with security forces, Venezuelan authorities announced on Tuesday, bringing an end to a dramatic event that unfolded a day earlier in videos on social media. Mr. Pérez, 36, rose to prominence last year as a dissident police officer during street protests against President Nicolás Maduro. In June, he and a small group commandeered a helicopter in the capital, Caracas, and used it to drop grenades onto the Supreme Court building and fire on the Interior Ministry in a brazen midday attack. Mr. Pérez then unfurled a banner calling on Venezuelans to rebel against Mr. Maduro, to the cheers of protesters below. He later released a video in which he and a band of masked men repeated their calls for a rebellion. While no one was injured in that attack, it was an embarrassment for the government, and officials vowed to capture him. He had been a fugitive — and an online nuisance to the government — ever since, posting videos urging Venezuelans to resist what he called Mr. Maduro’s tyrannical government. Mr. Pérez posted videos of himself early Monday, with blood dripping across his face, holed up in a house under fire. He shouted that the group wished to surrender, but that the police outside were set on killing them. “I want to ask Venezuela not to lose heart — fight, take to the streets,” he said. “It is time for us to be free, and only you have the power now.” On Tuesday, the Venezuelan interior and justice minister, Néstor Reverol, said Mr. Pérez was among seven dead, whom he called “insurgents and terrorists.” Two police officers were killed and five were injured, the authorities said. Mr. Reverol said that troops had arrested six people identified as members, collaborators and financiers of Mr. Pérez’s group. They also confiscated rifles, military uniforms, ammunition and smoke grenades. He offered few details on the capture on Tuesday other than saying that the tip as to the whereabouts of Mr. Pérez and his band had come from politicians during talks between the government and Venezuela’s opposition parties. “During the dialogue for peace, some political leaders gave important information about the alleged location of the terrorist group where Óscar Pérez was,” Mr. Reverol said. No politicians came forward to say they had provided information to Mr. Reverol on the group. Henrique Capriles, a former governor and top opposition leader, criticized the government for its assault against the rebels. “What we’ve seen in several videos and broadcast on social networks are absolutely abominable, Dantesque incidents, which show there was an execution we must condemn because there was no due process,” Mr. Capriles told the Venezuelan radio network Union Radio. Photographs of bodies believed to be those of the rebels have circulated on social media sites since Monday, said to have been leaked from the scene of the battle. In one, a man who appears to be Mr. Pérez lies face up, covered in blood as officials in dress shirts stand in the background. It was the end of a dramatic day that began with a series of videos posted on Twitter that showed Mr. Pérez bloodied and besieged. “They don’t want us to surrender, they want us dead!” he said. Over the course of hours, Mr. Pérez continued to post video updates online while his band fought from behind refrigerators and filing cabinets as the security forces closed in. As the videos progressed, the men looked increasingly weary and said they wanted to surrender. In one video, Mr. Pérez turned the camera outside, where government officials could be seen calling up to him. “We’re not criminals,” he told them. “We’re patriots who are fighting for our convictions.” Mr. Pérez had been one of the more improbable figures to emerge from last year’s political turmoil in Venezuela. A police officer who had once starred in a low-budget action movie about a crime squad, he was now a real-life version of the character he had portrayed. After appearing in public during an antigovernment rally in July, Mr. Pérez largely disappeared from public view. While some members of the security forces staged rebellions of their own in the time afterward, top military officials stayed loyal to Mr. Maduro’s government. Mr. Pérez’s abandoned helicopter was found by the government shortly after the June attack. Perhaps most demoralizing to Mr. Pérez and his followers was the disbanding of street protests against Mr. Maduro that took place after the president consolidated power by dissolving the opposition-controlled Congress and establishing a new one packed with loyalists.\1.023904800415039,0.275976300239563,-0.1390271931886673,0.4631847143173218,0.2839663326740265,-0.46885204315185547,1.1926823854446411,-0.14892880618572235,-2.316431999206543,-0.5729400515556335,0.3247978091239929,-0.3429560363292694,0.007000185549259186,0.46085432171821594,-0.9589956402778625,-0.7285666465759277,0.8954628109931946,0.4437735676765442,-0.2157164067029953,0.32075175642967224,0.9134710431098938,-0.4599134027957916,-1.3186811208724976,0.21760031580924988,-0.9128954410552979,0.7809616327285767,1.7526350021362305,1.6305001974105835,0.5454739928245544,0.34884047508239746,-0.22961124777793884,1.51054048538208,-0.6198558807373047,-0.14846760034561157,-0.16267573833465576,-0.1166507825255394,-0.14711929857730865,0.09632579237222672,0.7410910129547119,-0.883354663848877,-0.9637333154678345,-1.4200314283370972,0.21559560298919678,-0.8003259301185608,0.2969520092010498,-0.31005194783210754,-0.41287630796432495,-0.06676948815584183,-0.9522503018379211,-0.529690682888031,0.590487539768219,-0.6850300431251526,0.3360291123390198,-0.1180974692106247,1.6471372842788696,-0.2539113163948059,1.4305596351623535,0.22133409976959229,-0.6331391334533691,1.073652982711792,-0.7299193739891052,0.02544938400387764,1.13410222530365,0.44959840178489685,-1.4223192930221558,0.7602161765098572,-0.11476060748100281,1.0371586084365845,-0.6416447758674622,0.4746195077896118,0.5997304916381836,0.0012067750794813037,-0.22573208808898926,0.6018324494361877,-1.2521995306015015,0.3362599313259125,0.9227874279022217,-0.45001083612442017,-1.5293225049972534,0.12077570706605911,0.5793974995613098,-0.5129265785217285,-1.423028826713562,0.5077529549598694,1.4514169692993164,-0.11802282929420471,0.7701393365859985,0.9307104349136353,0.14806480705738068,0.4851725399494171,0.5031035542488098,0.967397928237915,-1.0834686756134033,-0.33018413186073303,-0.3593823313713074,0.17282560467720032,0.15420734882354736,-0.9335062503814697,-0.7474249601364136,1.4407203197479248\NYTIMES\Fugitive Venezuelan Police Officer Is Killed in Shootout\2018-01-17 02:09:38.0\
1779\Politics\TORONTO — It made the local news: Two figures were spotted walking across the city’s frozen downtown harbor. The afternoon newscast labeled them “tricksters.” Even for Canadians, it was freezing outside — the city was on Day 9 of a 14-day “extreme cold weather” alert, with the temperature at 8.6 degrees Fahrenheit (-13 degrees Celsius) and going down. City officials were scrambling to open emergency shelters, and warning residents to limit their time outdoors. Who in their right mind would walk across the frozen harbor? By the time the fire trucks arrived, one figure was heading back across the ice, groceries in hand. The other had hurried off to a downtown squash game. “Why did we do it? Because we’re alive!” one of the men, Michael Harris, 54, said a few days later from the warmth of his kitchen across the harbor on Ward’s Island. As it happens, Mr. Harris did have a tough moment as he returned across the frozen harbor with his groceries, falling through some slushy ice to his knees. He was unhurt. Falling is precisely why the city’s marine police and its harbor master warn against venturing onto the ice, though their big worry is that people will fall right through. Mr. Harris’s mishap, however, did not faze him. He is, after all, a man known to jog bare-chested in the winter and dive through a hole in the ice in search of an errant puck. Mr. Harris, who owns a sales training company, includes himself, if grudgingly, among the Toronto Islands residents he calls “wonderfully nutty.” They aren’t the minority. Eccentricity is part of the DNA of the 620 souls who choose — or get the chance — to live in a rural community smack in the middle of North America’s fourth-largest city. By rural, I mean this: It is not uncommon to come across a coyote or mink while strolling around the archipelago of 14 islands that includes Ward’s Island, just 10 minutes by ferry from downtown. Private cars are restricted here. Instead, local residents travel down the snowy footpaths between their homes on bicycle. The closest thing to a store is the “trading post” — an open wood shelter where residents leave their castoff books, toys and clothes for neighbors to pick through. If they need booze, or rice, or a light bulb, well, they have to ask a neighbor or head across the lake. It makes for a very tight-knit community of handy, patient and hardy people. There are no movie theaters or nightclubs, so people turn to what’s at hand for fun — nature. Only two of the islands are inhabited, and part of a third is taken up by the city’s small, downtown airport. The rest are city parkland. When the temperature is so cold that the entire harbor freezes, that signals “time to go out and play,” said Whitney Webster, a sixth-generation islander, standing out on the frozen harbor before Algonquin Island, the crowded concrete and glass spires of the city’s downtown rising like a ghostly battalion. Mr. Webster, 61, was out walking in the -9.4 degree afternoon (-23 Celsius) when he glimpsed a friend whizzing by in one of two local ice boats. Sure, he was dressed in jeans and leather gloves, but he couldn’t resist. The boom knocked off his hat, and his left hand went numb, but it was thrilling, cutting across the frozen lake in a sail boat rigged with three large blades. For residents, it is country-home life in the midst of a city. “It’s like living at the cottage,” said Mr. Webster, a retired government manager. “But look at the view you have.” The islands were once a sandy peninsula stretching 5.5 miles (8.9 kilometers) out from shore and shielding downtown like a sleeping arm and hand. But in 1858, a big storm cleaved a channel. Then it grew. Since the early days of settlement, the islands have offered an escape from the city — a place where colonists once went to ride horses or picnic. As the city grew, so did the attractions. There was a theater, an amusement park and a baseball stadium, where Babe Ruth hit his first professional home run in 1914. Cottages and tents went up, too, with as many as 8,000 Torontonians moving there for the summer. “There were hotels and restaurants and drugstores,” said Jimmy Jones, who moved here 85 years ago, when he was 2. “Everything was there. You didn’t have to go to the city for anything.” Mr. Jones made headlines at 75, wakeboarding at a summer festival. He still bikes, and he skates the islands’ lagoons — though not the way he once did, racing against a neighbor who once rowed across the Atlantic Ocean. In 1956, the city’s newly formed metropolitan government announced that it was converting the islands’ residential and commercial properties, all on leased public land, into a park and began demolition. The battle for the community on the two most easterly islands continued for almost four decades. The high point, Islanders will tell you, came in the summer of 1980, when the volunteer home guard’s air raid siren went off, alerting locals that the sheriff was en route with eviction notices. Whisked from their downtown jobs by the “Island Navy” of volunteer boats, hundreds gathered and linked arms across the road to block his route. The following year, the provincial government passed a law allowing the 262 remaining homes to stay put until 2005. Those leases were later extended to late 2092. While the rest of city has seen a real estate frenzy, here house prices have remained astonishingly low because the few sales are overseen by a community trust that both sets the price and selects the buyer from a waiting list, kept at 500. Last year, a tumbledown lakefront house and lease here went for just over $58,000 (72,000 Canadian dollars), while a similar fixer-upper on Toronto’s beachfront rang in at more than one million Canadian dollars. “We are here to care for the island, not to profit from it,” said Elizabeth Amer, a retired editor and City Council member who inherited her mother’s home, and likes to watch the swans navigate the ice from her living room window. A trip across the islands on a bus, brought in when the ferry was broken, had the ambience of a school outing, with neighbors chatting across the aisle. Most were noticeably older. The median age of Island residents is 55.6 — making the islands among the country’s most elderly census tracts. (By comparison, the median age of Torontonians over all is 39.3.) That is one consequence of the community trust. Since only one or two houses go up for sale a year, it can take 30 years on the waiting list to buy a house here. By then, many buyers are already into retirement age. The irony, of course, is that the park is the ideal place to be a kid. Julian Ganton, now 31, recounted summers spent sleeping in tents high in the trees and winters spent playing shinny — that’s Canadian for pickup hockey — right outside his house. He laced up a pair of skates and climbed down a ladder onto the frozen harbor, where he cut over cracks and frozen methane bubbles. A hockey stick in hand for balance, he pushed off toward the middle of the harbor. Toronto city officials are not the only ones to put out reports on ice conditions. So do the islanders. As a rule, they say that three inches thick is safe to go on, two inches if it is bitterly cold. When Mr. Ganton went out, it was at least one foot thick — 18 inches, in Mr. Webster’s estimation. Even so, the sound of the ice groaning and cracking made Mr. Ganton’s heart jump — with both fear and delight. “You never get used to it,” he said. “It always fills you with awe.”\2.855705738067627,-1.1546283960342407,-1.5280323028564453,2.06173038482666,-1.230369210243225,0.34471482038497925,1.6695266962051392,-0.832181453704834,-1.8554075956344604,0.3277055323123932,-0.4004022777080536,-0.3519529104232788,0.6327317953109741,0.3202444314956665,-1.5014352798461914,0.4365542232990265,-1.1436959505081177,0.5940146446228027,-0.5567886829376221,-0.6084735989570618,1.8432157039642334,-0.10403779149055481,-1.3855507373809814,-1.7826327085494995,0.6664634943008423,2.972512722015381,1.7422730922698975,2.2404799461364746,-2.156752824783325,-1.012107491493225,-0.9588224291801453,0.5905693769454956,-0.13306522369384766,-0.1712167114019394,0.03257855772972107,-1.1473432779312134,0.9169195890426636,0.23639041185379028,1.8591103553771973,-0.35281580686569214,-0.0963706225156784,-0.45630890130996704,2.3835697174072266,-0.05501410365104675,-0.05018706992268562,0.523668110370636,-0.2359779179096222,0.452465683221817,-0.9484939575195312,-0.938570499420166,1.5414342880249023,-1.0103743076324463,-0.5269089937210083,-0.10721571743488312,0.811007559299469,-1.382824182510376,1.5253981351852417,0.0406448058784008,-0.23043842613697052,1.2124855518341064,-0.18830035626888275,-0.8592948317527771,0.3915497064590454,-1.1229887008666992,-1.008813500404358,1.6054956912994385,0.771249532699585,1.66448175907135,-1.6114907264709473,0.8928468227386475,0.7368836998939514,-0.1862030178308487,-0.3441091477870941,1.8012481927871704,-1.6066089868545532,-1.1453198194503784,-0.5812419056892395,0.16629581153392792,-1.1143031120300293,-0.9077469110488892,0.480669766664505,-0.004956529010087252,-2.8448047637939453,1.0151294469833374,0.34162455797195435,-1.1605703830718994,0.4767001271247864,0.9400423169136047,0.13179601728916168,0.826259970664978,-1.3583916425704956,1.2610925436019897,-1.5180023908615112,-1.0048142671585083,-0.04356186464428902,-0.7469796538352966,-0.22777844965457916,-0.9835688471794128,-1.0702813863754272,0.7286757826805115\NYTIMES\Toronto Journal: Shivering?

1780\Politics\PRAGUE — The Czech Parliament rejected the minority government of Prime Minister Andrej Babis in a no-confidence vote on Tuesday, a move that is likely to prompt weeks, if not months, of further political wrangling. In the meantime, the minority cabinet, made up of members of Mr. Babis’s party and affiliated experts, will continue to lead the country while Mr. Babis attempts to form another cabinet that would be acceptable to Parliament. In Eastern Europe, resentment of Brussels and resistance to immigration have helped propel populist parties to power in several countries, notably Hungary and Poland. But the rise of the right there, in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia has also been driven by a variety of domestic issues. Mr. Babis, a billionaire anti-establishment candidate who vowed during the campaign to fight corruption and introduce economic overhauls, is a polarizing figure. His political positions are hard to pin down, but they are tinged with populist rhetoric. The Ano party of Mr. Babis won elections in October, gaining almost 30 percent of vote. The president, Milos Zeman, appointed him prime minister in early December. Since then, however, Mr. Babis has failed to form a coalition that would command a majority in Parliament. Mr. Zeman himself is currently in a battle for his own job. The first round of presidential elections took place on Friday and Saturday, and even though he finished in first place, he will face the runner-up, Jiri Drahos, in a runoff starting Jan. 26 because he failed to receive more than 50 percent of the vote in the field of nine. As Mr. Babis’s political rise gathered pace, he became the target of an investigation into possible tax crimes during his time as finance minister in the previous governing coalition. In October, he was indicted on charges of misusing European Union subsidies. Mr. Babis has called the charges politically motivated. Mr. Babis has denied any wrongdoing, but Parliament is considering a measure that would strip him of his immunity as an elected official, allowing for a criminal prosecution. As those concerns swirled during the campaign, several rival parties vowed not to form a government with Ano, saying that Mr. Babis’s upstart party posed a threat to democracy and that Mr. Babis was an unacceptable choice to run the country. “No serious negotiations were held, and now it is time to issue the bill,” Jan Hamacek, vice chairman of the lower house and a lawmaker with the Czech Social Democratic Party, wrote on Twitter last week, referring to the lack of talks to build a coalition. Only lawmakers from the Ano party voted for the government, despite support from Mr. Zeman, the president, who is considered an ally of Mr. Babis. “I believe the program of this government is, in a good sense, like a smorgasbord: Anybody can choose what they like,” Mr. Zeman told Parliament last week. The Czech Republic has previously been run by minority governments lacking the majority support of Parliament. But the controversy surrounding Mr. Babis and the possibility of a future cabinet being forged with the support of an extreme-right party, Freedom and Direct Democracy, or with the Communist Party — or both — complicates the current impasse. “There are many mathematical possibilities to form a majority government, but somebody will have to let go of their requirements, and I am afraid that at least Mr. Babis and President Zeman will not budge,” said Otto Eibl, a political analyst from Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic. Mr. Babis said he had been expecting to lose the vote on Tuesday. “We want to talk about our program, mainly about pensions,” he said in remarks last week quoted by the Czech News Agency, referring to the direction his government would now take. Mr. Zeman said he would give Mr. Babis another chance to form a government, but he added that at least 101 votes — a majority — would be needed in the lower chamber to reappoint Mr. Babis as prime minister.\1.38267982006073,0.1982908546924591,-0.9721473455429077,-0.13424170017242432,0.8859513998031616,-0.4514322578907013,0.3205637037754059,0.01873849704861641,-1.600642204284668,-0.0736764520406723,1.6362723112106323,0.4025866389274597,0.35429316759109497,0.5916475653648376,-1.0858722925186157,-0.7585989236831665,0.6454113125801086,-0.10583198070526123,-0.05716293677687645,0.8342719078063965,-0.6668375730514526,-1.1283378601074219,-0.9903454184532166,-0.14034605026245117,-0.7731320858001709,0.5217311382293701,1.0598078966140747,0.6595031023025513,-1.2043828964233398,0.49245086312294006,-0.3268676698207855,0.6492780447006226,0.14845527708530426,0.41228771209716797,0.9907747507095337,0.03711072355508804,-0.445649117231369,0.3288246989250183,-0.5879440307617188,-1.2724777460098267,-0.3494487404823303,-1.3924285173416138,0.22532790899276733,-1.4174156188964844,0.37409210205078125,-0.09517742693424225,-0.4719085693359375,0.9654920101165771,0.4978025555610657,0.7103466391563416,0.21012309193611145,-1.0581285953521729,0.8205727934837341,0.06456096470355988,1.733912467956543,-1.4614660739898682,1.1774550676345825,-0.8802562355995178,-0.8652951717376709,0.12062238156795502,-1.1593645811080933,0.30626070499420166,1.5863380432128906,0.5599980354309082,-0.8190405368804932,0.14756299555301666,-0.5462729334831238,-0.7647179365158081,-1.0648220777511597,0.8042136430740356,0.4776742160320282,-0.5507491827011108,-0.5849689245223999,-0.3211705982685089,-1.130968451499939,0.28159382939338684,0.3883504569530487,-0.4318362772464752,-1.2270931005477905,-0.23474152386188507,1.015912652015686,-0.7979910969734192,-1.2464466094970703,-0.00876612402498722,-0.5941618084907532,1.187129259109497,1.2276911735534668,0.37737852334976196,-1.0142537355422974,-0.27105480432510376,-0.7832346558570862,0.5679118633270264,-2.1981964111328125,-0.13496087491512299,-0.698158860206604,0.06202349439263344,-0.24015454947948456,-0.8241146206855774,-1.6331937313079834,0.39124101400375366\NYTIMES\Czech Republic Faces Political Turmoil After No-Confidence Vote\2018-01-16 16:51:13.0\
1781\Politics\Japan’s public broadcaster on Tuesday accidentally sent news alerts that North Korea had launched a missile and that citizens should take shelter — just days after the government of Hawaii had sent a similar warning to its citizens. The broadcaster, NHK, corrected itself five minutes later and apologized for the error on its evening news. The initial texts cited J-Alert, a system used by the government to issue warnings to its citizens about missiles, tsunamis and other natural disasters. But NHK later said that the system was not to blame for the false alarm. Makoto Sasaki, a spokesman for NHK, apologized, saying that “staff had mistakenly operated the equipment to deliver news alerts over the internet.” The broadcaster’s swift rectification of its error stands in contrast to the 38-minute delay by officials in Hawaii on Saturday to cancel warnings of an incoming ballistic missile. It took a further five hours for Hawaii’s governor, David Y. Ige, to apologize for the mistake. That blunder was blamed on a veteran employee at the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency who had sent the missile alert to cellphones across the state by picking the wrong option on his computer for a routine drill, and then confirming his choice. The mistake sowed panic; a missile launched from North Korea would land in Honolulu in about 30 minutes, giving people little time to prepare. After NHK’s announcement about making an error, Twitter users expressed their frustration and disbelief. “I thought I would die,” one Twitter user wrote in Japanese, followed by a “LOL.” Another, using the name Michiya Hayashi, wrote: “Following Hawaii, NHK did it too. Don’t become the boy who cried wolf.” If the citizens of Japan and Hawaii were only starting to shake off any sense of unease, North Korea waded into the debate on Tuesday, with its state-run newspaper describing the false alarm in Hawaii as a “tragicomedy.” “The entire island was thrown into an utter chaos at the news that a ballistic missile was coming in,” said the newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, with unmistakable glee. The newspaper also characterized a tweet by President Trump two weeks ago in which he claimed to have a bigger nuclear button than the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, as “a spasm of a lunatic” and the “bark of a rabid dog.” “The spasm of Trump in the new year reflects the desperate mental state of a loser who failed to check the vigorous advance of the army and people” of North Korea, the newspaper said in a commentary. Mr. Trump has so far not responded to those comments.\0.5313382744789124,-0.12896721065044403,0.19454142451286316,0.01343174371868372,0.7293031215667725,-1.0660717487335205,1.4671629667282104,-0.4775896966457367,-0.8956268429756165,-1.2937514781951904,-0.32455694675445557,0.2689545154571533,-0.07389810681343079,0.8258941769599915,-0.416248083114624,-0.5045070052146912,0.14929893612861633,-0.2733471393585205,0.47811776399612427,0.559162974357605,-0.13921384513378143,-0.8215636014938354,0.6691906452178955,-0.10918159782886505,0.7990853786468506,0.29294875264167786,0.34287431836128235,0.6616184115409851,0.4518124461174011,0.12989091873168945,0.5156466364860535,0.38947349786758423,0.6370496153831482,0.674655020236969,0.0015769479796290398,-0.459049791097641,-0.23920461535453796,-0.2633928060531616,-0.5434526801109314,-0.5631165504455566,-0.5077106356620789,-1.247038722038269,1.1057778596878052,0.3337714672088623,-0.8611207008361816,-0.4785971939563751,0.7567386031150818,-0.03951794281601906,-1.997048020362854,-1.1628230810165405,0.5221522450447083,0.16576261818408966,-0.34227728843688965,0.4005460739135742,1.2876505851745605,-0.536408007144928,1.0321533679962158,1.0548369884490967,-1.5453425645828247,0.6817718744277954,0.36304205656051636,0.32689589262008667,0.6266646981239319,-0.03194810077548027,-0.9138582944869995,0.33995020389556885,0.8868560194969177,0.4264746904373169,-0.9988555312156677,0.23667362332344055,0.4980223476886749,-0.1615261286497116,0.20598214864730835,0.945858895778656,-0.9206117987632751,-0.20497801899909973,0.23639430105686188,0.017970915883779526,-0.5673595070838928,-0.32856136560440063,0.5694057941436768,0.8691654205322266,-0.6216633915901184,0.30612269043922424,1.4118990898132324,-0.6720367074012756,-0.1520693451166153,0.43411868810653687,-0.4197046160697937,0.1349814236164093,-0.41852137446403503,0.7511266469955444,-0.8302333354949951,0.13148391246795654,0.6719110608100891,-0.3665124177932739,-0.786382794380188,0.10910140722990036,-0.2740402817726135,0.4896567463874817\NYTIMES\Days After Hawaii’s False Missile Alarm, a New One in Japan\2018-01-16 17:22:21.0\1781, 1840
1782\Politics\A bridge under construction in a mountainous region of central Colombia has collapsed, throwing 10 workers about 900 feet to their deaths. The victims had been doing drainage work on Monday on the Chirijara bridge, a 1,500-foot-long structure over a gorge about an hour’s drive from Villavicencio, on the highway to the capital, Bogotá. Nine of those who fell died immediately, and the 10th died of his injuries after being taken to a hospital. Coviandes, the company carrying out the work, published the names of the nine who died at the site and said that others wounded in the collapse were being treated. The National Infrastructure Agency of Colombia said it was investigating the cause. About 260 feet of the bridge was still incomplete when it collapsed. The bridge was intended as an improvement to the highway linking Bogotá and Villavicencio. The picturesque route crosses the tropical northern Andes, with a series of sharp bends and vertiginous drops. The same route was the scene of a landslide in 1974, which claimed at least 200 lives.\0.46362027525901794,-0.16950097680091858,-0.633373498916626,0.10070234537124634,-0.5721417665481567,-0.24056509137153625,0.5120365023612976,-0.019186068326234818,-0.5857697129249573,-0.32940950989723206,-0.14991751313209534,0.30544209480285645,0.06328272819519043,-0.4167505204677582,-0.4037110209465027,0.443864107131958,-0.525600790977478,-0.004324422217905521,-0.01540416944772005,0.19006700813770294,0.06647078692913055,-0.48942774534225464,0.34380054473876953,-0.0795372724533081,-0.5393843650817871,0.09043894708156586,0.6207647323608398,0.4024217128753662,0.35660964250564575,0.7980098724365234,-0.6656505465507507,-0.26783326268196106,-0.5234017968177795,-0.0693519115447998,0.5464395880699158,-0.28412774205207825,0.16862323880195618,-0.6278133988380432,-0.10742069035768509,-0.6450279355049133,-0.4489453434944153,-0.07199027389287949,0.35293200612068176,-0.38749510049819946,-0.36501798033714294,0.12365301698446274,0.4575093984603882,0.30990663170814514,-1.5108354091644287,-0.5163594484329224,0.22444747388362885,0.1990741789340973,-0.5392400622367859,-0.05988084897398949,0.21172119677066803,-0.09524869918823242,0.5104163885116577,-0.6428589224815369,-0.1899867206811905,1.0543957948684692,0.2830369472503662,-0.25814154744148254,0.0803029015660286,-0.025890812277793884,-0.23899498581886292,0.175880566239357,-0.07133568078279495,0.09882691502571106,-0.1616099327802658,0.18352848291397095,-0.1481408029794693,0.4842548370361328,-0.12651918828487396,0.13633675873279572,-0.4193611145019531,0.1568579077720642,-0.35401374101638794,0.681384265422821,-0.7765451669692993,-0.5823233127593994,0.559343695640564,-0.13181465864181519,-0.25668659806251526,0.06264052540063858,-0.3618904948234558,0.006973173003643751,0.1255379319190979,0.5928972959518433,0.2471652328968048,0.5353840589523315,-0.7952233552932739,0.8404738903045654,-0.4996013343334198,0.06437932699918747,0.30388548970222473,0.004414130933582783,0.06453073024749756,0.30796658992767334,-0.19153229892253876,0.8795693516731262\NYTIMES\Colombia Bridge Collapse Throws Workers to Their Deaths\2018-01-16 17:21:30.0\
1783\Politics\RIJEKA, Croatia — A prominent Serb politician in Kosovo, a rare voice for coexistence of ethnic Albanians and Serbs, was shot and killed on Tuesday, heightening tensions between Kosovo and Serbia, which has refused to recognize Kosovo’s independence. Oliver Ivanovic, 64, the leader of the Citizens’ Initiative Party, was shot outside the party’s offices in Mitrovica, a northern city that is divided along ethnic lines. Though seen as a moderate in Serb politics in Kosovo, Mr. Ivanovic, whose party was not backed by the government in Belgrade, also faced war crimes charges, which he and his allies described as politically motivated. In a televised news conference, Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vucic, insisted that his government had no role in what he called “a terrorist act,” and suggested that the killing was part of a campaign by Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian majority to take control of the country’s predominantly Serb north. He called a meeting of his security council, and warned the government of Kosovo not to use the assassination “as a pretext to send their boots on the ground in the north.” But an opposition leader in Serbia, Sasa Jankovic, noted on Tuesday that Mr. Vucic’s government, which he described as repressive, had been harshly critical of Mr. Ivanovic in the past. “Whoever did this — and we do not know who it is — works against the interests of the Serbs and of Serbia and the Albanian people and everyone else,” he said. The Kosovo government condemned the killing, which it said “challenges the rule of law and any attempt to establish order throughout the entire territory of Kosovo.” In a statement, Hashim Thaci, president of Kosovo, said, “I call on the law enforcement authorities to expose the circumstances of his assassination as soon as possible and the perpetrators of the crime come to justice.” In Brussels, after the assassination, a Serb delegation walked out of talks on Tuesday on normalizing relations between Kosovo and Serbia. The European Union has served as a mediator as both Serbia and Kosovo seek to join the 28-nation bloc. But recognizing Kosovo’s independence is a condition for Serbia’s membership in the bloc. Serbia considers Kosovo the cradle of the Serbian nation and of its Christian Orthodox faith and refuses to recognize its former province as an independent state, a stance backed by Russia. Serbia had ruled the predominantly ethnic Albanian province since the late 1980s, when its former strongman, Slobodan Milosevic, revoked Kosovo’s autonomy. Serb forces were driven out in 1999, after an American-led NATO bombing campaign. Kosovo declared independence in February 2008, with the overwhelming backing of Western countries like the United States and most members of the European Union. However, the ethnic Albanian-dominated government in the capital, Pristina, has failed to bring under its control the predominantly Serb parts of the country north of the Ibar River, including Mitrovica. The city is divided by the Ibar, with Albanians in the southern part and Serbs in the north, where Mr. Ivanovic was killed. When the war ended, NATO troops under French command allowed the city to be partitioned at the river, with the Serbs controlling the northern sector and maintaining close ties to Belgrade. Mr. Ivanovic had no shortage of enemies, and someone set fire to his car outside his house in July 2017, after which some of his allies urged him to leave the country. In addition to being at the center of political tensions, he was an outspoken critic of Kosovo’s drug gangs and the authorities who he said allowed traffickers to operate with impunity. His is one of several ethnic Serb parties in Kosovo, but unlike its major rivals, it is less subservient to Belgrade, and willing to recognize and work with the ethnic Albanian authorities. Under a previous administration in Belgrade, he served as chief of Serbia’s Ministry for Kosovo. “He had a small party but a huge reputation,” said Dusan Reljic, a southeast Europe specialist at German Institute for International Affairs and Security, who knew Mr. Ivanovic. “If you were looking for someone who could build bridges, it would be him, which is why neither the government in Pristina nor the government in Belgrade liked him.” “Oliver knew he wasn’t safe,” Mr. Reljic added. A doctor who treated Mr. Ivanovic said he had been shot five times in the upper body. The police responded by blockading the Serb-majority northern part of the city as they searched for the gunman. In 2014, a special European Union court set up to deal with Kosovo charged Mr. Ivanovic with involvement in the expulsion and killing of Albanian civilians. He was convicted in 2016 on one count, but an appeals court overturned that verdict last year and ordered a new trial. International representatives in Kosovo condemned the killing on Tuesday, and called for a full investigation. Tensions have escalated in Kosovo as the nation of 1.8 million prepares to celebrate the 10th anniversary of its statehood. Last week, the State Department warned Americans to exercise caution if traveling to the country, citing an increased threat of terrorism, particularly in Serb-dominated enclaves, including northern Mitrovica. Mr. Ivanovic, who was married and had three children, was one of the main leaders of the Serbs in northern Mitrovica but later came to support better relations with ethnic Albanians, including the government in Pristina. Marko Duric, the director of Serbia’s Ministry for Kosovo, said that whoever killed Mr. Ivanovic had aimed to destabilize the region. “The goal is to provoke chaos and to push Serbs in Kosovo and Serbia into the hell of fighting,” he told reporters in Brussels.\1.5424078702926636,0.7703518867492676,-0.4031645357608795,0.8324658870697021,-0.11203549802303314,-0.0467422790825367,1.0420621633529663,0.04760587215423584,-1.0666582584381104,-1.01450514793396,0.3636039197444916,1.1493382453918457,0.0023466330021619797,1.4925168752670288,-0.7260282039642334,-0.9171358346939087,-0.9059111475944519,0.23552647233009338,0.4133768677711487,0.11339232325553894,0.10347949713468552,-1.3265650272369385,0.4698164761066437,0.059357449412345886,-0.4279802739620209,0.1786329746246338,1.4209060668945312,1.056686282157898,0.45442748069763184,0.4557434916496277,-0.16188204288482666,0.8650373816490173,0.21093986928462982,0.07080498337745667,-0.3823477625846863,0.2496000975370407,-0.6960036754608154,-0.1012866422533989,-0.3565371334552765,-1.5386353731155396,-0.6183785796165466,-0.8852162957191467,-0.038313426077365875,-1.1458896398544312,-0.13639970123767853,0.10800033062696457,0.8408197164535522,0.7134853005409241,-1.977817416191101,0.6462157368659973,0.07711067795753479,-1.1171202659606934,0.30486080050468445,-0.308096706867218,0.8741626143455505,-0.058376166969537735,1.9445990324020386,0.5817188620567322,-1.0081795454025269,0.7253347039222717,0.03813503682613373,0.4657894968986511,0.3426963686943054,0.9209256768226624,-1.0076026916503906,1.0386817455291748,1.1488195657730103,1.0642493963241577,-0.029712367802858353,1.0380229949951172,0.8839112520217896,0.5160374641418457,-0.34784480929374695,0.9695853590965271,-1.271730661392212,0.28301218152046204,0.5304180383682251,0.13671231269836426,-1.1790831089019775,-1.1937428712844849,1.5391656160354614,0.3057784140110016,-1.208216667175293,0.7274186015129089,0.608154833316803,0.8633392453193665,0.6106671094894409,0.3550693988800049,0.3599676191806793,-0.5005433559417725,-0.045048974454402924,1.364107608795166,-2.6109542846679688,-0.3704836368560791,-0.006484178826212883,-0.3999895453453064,-0.280245840549469,-1.0391901731491089,-0.8497439026832581,0.9918322563171387\NYTIMES\Oliver Ivanovic, Moderate Kosovo Serb Leader, Is Killed\2018-01-16 22:47:16.0\
1784\Politics\Tensions in Iran. Cold weather in the United States. A year of production cuts. With 2018 still young, there has been no shortage of reasons oil prices are pushing higher. Prices for Brent crude, the international benchmark, have risen nearly 50 percent since June. They briefly passed $70 a barrel more than once in the last week — the first time the per-barrel price has reached $70 since December 2014. Stockpiles of oil that built up for years are declining. And a buoyant global economy has bolstered demand, meaning prices could go higher still. “The market has entered a new phase,” said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a research firm in London. The dynamics at play are in sharp contrast with the situation just a year ago. The market has gradually realigned, in large part because of an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia — two of the world’s three largest oil producers — to restrain output. That deal, renewed in November through the end of this year, has removed around one million barrels of crude a day from the global supply. At the same time, demand for oil and its associated products has grown at a brisker clip than many analysts expected. As a result, the glut of energy around the world that once filled vast tank farms and enormous supertankers anchored at sea is gradually being worked off. Without the buffer of that big inventory, the global energy market has become more sensitive to disruptions, whether real or prospective. For instance, the shutdown in December of a British pipeline system in the North Sea removed an estimated nine million barrels of oil from the market over nearly three weeks. The move, which was made after the pipeline’s new owner, Ineos, found flaws in the system, propelled prices higher. A record-breaking cold snap in the United States, meanwhile, pushed up demand for heating oil, bolstering demand. But now, there are additional pressing issues. Although the Trump administration grudgingly agreed on Friday not to reimpose comprehensive sanctions on Iran, there is concern that the recent crackdown on Iranian protests, coupled with Tehran’s involvement in conflicts in Syria and Yemen, will eventually be met by tough sanctions from Washington. Such measures would again cut into Iran’s ability to export oil. For now, supplies from Iran have not been affected, but traders and analysts are nevertheless watching the rallies and their consequences. Political risks elsewhere are also helping to push prices higher, including long-running tensions between Iraq’s government in Baghdad and the autonomous Kurdish enclave in the north, and the collapse of Venezuela’s oil industry. Both countries are major suppliers of crude — Iraq produces 4.5 million barrels of oil, and Venezuela adds around 1.8 million barrels — and any disruptions there could have a significant impact on global markets. There are also factors mitigating a relentless rise in prices, though. For one, the higher prices would most likely lead to increased investment and exploration for oil and, eventually, more production. This is especially true of smaller producers in the United States, whose output is already growing. There is skepticism over whether drillers in Texas and elsewhere can increase output fast enough to create another glut. “There is a natural limit to what shale can do,” said Antoine Rostand, president of Kayrros, a market research firm. “Trees don’t grow to the sky.” But these so-called swing producers have been crucial to previous price declines. The International Energy Agency, in an Oil Market Report published in December, noted that new supplies coming onto the market, particularly from the United States, might still exceed growth in demand in the first half of the year. On the whole, the oil industry appears to be well down the road of having adjusted to the steep price falls that began in 2014 and saw oil dipping to the $30-a-barrel range. Among the shifts: OPEC has taken a more active role in managing global energy markets, with Russia — which is not a member — unofficially replacing weakened or uncooperative cartel members like Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela. Oil companies have also reshaped themselves, sharply increasing efficiency and reducing costs to a point where they are profitable at current levels, or even lower ones. They have cut huge numbers of jobs, simplified the designs of their exploration infrastructure and embraced new technologies. Indeed, the availability of supplies at those lower costs may be the best bet for keeping recent price rises under control.\0.516615092754364,-0.31908679008483887,-0.9958144426345825,-0.8501943945884705,-0.32702481746673584,0.9601235389709473,0.7121896147727966,-0.0038575290236622095,-1.2080787420272827,-1.2666420936584473,-0.5649302005767822,1.3030405044555664,0.7209973335266113,-0.388918936252594,-2.2270400524139404,-0.6127808094024658,0.22890615463256836,1.6979469060897827,-0.24815161526203156,0.7247227430343628,-1.9806878566741943,-0.05848986655473709,-0.11691520363092422,-1.1184829473495483,-0.5147308707237244,1.568742036819458,-0.022284800186753273,-0.48389631509780884,0.05389919877052307,-0.3358840048313141,-0.6113380789756775,0.4764207899570465,0.026416921988129616,1.2329201698303223,-0.3346981406211853,-0.49950018525123596,-1.2674708366394043,-0.5905863642692566,1.0226247310638428,-0.012450315058231354,-1.384665608406067,-1.0611121654510498,0.8346206545829773,-0.20892299711704254,0.26132073998451233,0.25484710931777954,-1.550295114517212,-0.48356887698173523,-0.9654231071472168,-0.19751764833927155,-0.07939554005861282,0.9034880995750427,0.2019927054643631,0.5310172438621521,0.24080845713615417,-0.793746292591095,0.2749978303909302,0.4161742031574249,0.057901348918676376,0.9313763380050659,0.4094020426273346,-0.1358712613582611,-0.3273426592350006,0.6211890578269958,0.7166708111763,-0.11860276013612747,0.2510813772678375,0.9876299500465393,-0.27564406394958496,0.10429973155260086,-0.7459464073181152,1.082598090171814,-0.7355847954750061,0.028067678213119507,-1.2871226072311401,-0.5501236319541931,0.5716335773468018,-0.5374239087104797,-0.9773276448249817,-0.48910611867904663,-0.4461655616760254,0.021932702511548996,0.01010954100638628,0.31090882420539856,0.1395968347787857,-1.1105214357376099,0.11553553491830826,0.1486525684595108,0.6900388598442078,-0.14096000790596008,-1.502885341644287,-0.25017720460891724,0.7767292857170105,1.0191270112991333,-0.10334326326847076,0.3594180643558502,0.2863830029964447,-0.6148201823234558,-0.5228967666625977,1.643945336341858\NYTIMES\Oil Price Briefly Reaches $70 as Buoyant Global Economy Bolsters Demand\2018-01-17 01:53:15.0\
1785\Politics\HONG KONG — An oil spill from an Iranian tanker that sank in the East China Sea is rapidly spreading, officials said Tuesday, alarming environmentalists about the threat to sea and bird life in the waterway. The tanker, the Sanchi, was carrying 136,000 tons of highly flammable fuel oil when it crashed into a freighter on Jan. 6. On Sunday, the Sanchi sank after a huge blast sent up a great plume of black smoke and set the surface of the water on fire, China Central Television said. The bodies of three crew members have been recovered, and the remaining 29 were presumed dead, the Iranian government said. Thirty Iranians and two Bangladeshis were believed to have died. The oil slicks from the sunken tanker were growing in size, China’s State Oceanic Administration said Tuesday. There are now two huge slicks covering 52 square miles, compared with just four square miles the previous day. Strong winds were pushing the spill toward Japan, away from China, and it was now less than 200 miles from Naha, Japan. One concern is that, since the Sanchi sank, marine life will be endangered by the fuel oil’s spreading instead of burning off. And experts are further concerned that the even dirtier bunker fuel powering the tanker will be released into the sea, exposing delicate marine life to the extremely toxic substance. Greenpeace expressed alarm about the threat to the marine ecosystem in the East China Sea, which is one of the world’s most heavily trafficked waterways, saying the disaster occurred in “an important spawning ground” for fish. “At this time of year the area is used as wintering ground by common edible species such as hairtail, yellow croaker, chub mackerel and blue crab,” Greenpeace said. “The area is also on the migratory pathway of many marine mammals, such as humpback whale, right whale and gray whale.” The tanker was carrying more than one million barrels of condensate, an extremely light crude oil, to South Korea when it collided with the freighter. When spilled, the condensate can produce a deep underwater plume damaging to marine life. The Japanese Coast Guard said the fire on the surface of the sea was extinguished early Monday. “Given the poor condition of the ship after a week of fire and explosions, it is likely that all cargo (and fuel) tanks are breached, and all of this toxic hydrocarbon mixture has now been released into the environment,” said Rick Steiner, a marine conservation specialist formerly with the University of Alaska. “If so, this is the single largest environmental release of petroleum condensate in history,” he said. The Sanchi disaster appears to be the largest tanker spill since 1991, when an unexplained detonation caused the ABT tanker to leak 260,000 tons of oil off the coast of Angola. Hiroshi Takahashi, a fisheries official in Kagoshima Prefecture in Japan, said the government was “monitoring the direction” of the spill because of fears it “could direct towards Kagoshima.” The deaths of the Iranian crew members on the tanker prompted Iran’s government to declare a day of national mourning on Monday to honor “the brave mariners who died in the course of their mission.” Eshaq Jahangiri, Iran’s first vice president, said that efforts to recover the bodies of 29 crew members ceased when the tanker sank off the China’s coast on Sunday. Because of the release of toxic gases in the immediate aftermath of the explosion, there was little hope that the crew members survived, but efforts to recover their bodies had continued, Mr. Jahangiri said. “Unfortunately, the ship sank and we could not access their bodies.” Officials still don’t know the cause of the collision between the Sanchi and the CF Crystal, a Chinese freighter that was carrying grain.\1.5476642847061157,0.5379992723464966,-0.7715745568275452,1.087538242340088,-0.19038096070289612,0.2990609407424927,0.8397740721702576,-0.4635489881038666,-1.6011896133422852,-0.8233163356781006,0.8079462051391602,0.5496090054512024,0.6687180995941162,0.3549628257751465,-1.1159112453460693,-0.7278134822845459,0.0633755624294281,0.8518499732017517,0.0033674633596092463,0.1619301438331604,0.7542847394943237,-1.2098236083984375,-0.21154840290546417,-0.04654558375477791,-0.18451718986034393,-0.2405756115913391,1.5577921867370605,-0.10545551031827927,-0.6836326122283936,1.0605651140213013,-1.2871174812316895,0.3167053163051605,-1.323643684387207,0.2607099115848541,0.1154373288154602,-0.6694775223731995,-0.6677939891815186,-0.529549241065979,0.8088663816452026,1.0627139806747437,-0.562231719493866,-0.2643083930015564,0.23787719011306763,0.11602713912725449,-0.1435965895652771,0.2999391257762909,0.25696301460266113,-0.3713560700416565,-1.6913987398147583,-1.601449728012085,-0.2767981290817261,0.38466572761535645,0.1054888516664505,0.3683674931526184,-0.4890210032463074,-1.4920012950897217,0.6690123677253723,0.3291970193386078,-0.4614884853363037,1.1194738149642944,0.3344966471195221,0.13569512963294983,0.5416340827941895,0.3729028105735779,-0.20230042934417725,0.16705258190631866,1.5124658346176147,0.2295209765434265,-0.7198225855827332,0.9024909138679504,-0.33524808287620544,0.6847531199455261,0.11504478007555008,0.40669503808021545,-0.9827643632888794,0.283307284116745,-0.002061138628050685,0.5938202738761902,-0.9349106550216675,-1.0638089179992676,0.47850775718688965,0.291553795337677,-0.6550078392028809,-0.5645849704742432,0.5099319815635681,0.39281049370765686,0.5230821967124939,-0.040202490985393524,0.495679646730423,-0.11684732139110565,-1.5020850896835327,0.7888832688331604,0.7459294199943542,-0.29300445318222046,0.5289035439491272,0.20718902349472046,0.9926016330718994,-0.019187750294804573,-0.07067187875509262,1.2728065252304077\NYTIMES\Huge Oil Spill Spreads in East China Sea, Stirring Environmental Fears\2018-01-17 01:17:15.0\
1786\Politics\Earlier this month, we published an article on Mexican towns and cities that are dealing with public corruption and record violence by effectively seceding from the state. But we wanted to elaborate more on this story, to recount what it was like to report on each town, which we visited last year, and offer our thoughts on its larger lessons for Mexico and the world. This is the second of a three-part series that originally appeared in our Interpreter newsletter. The third will publish later this month. So sign up the Interpreter newsletter here, and let us know what you think: interpreter@nytimes.com. When we talk to political scientists who study American democracy about what worries them most — and they worry about many things these days — their answer is often political parties. Whatever you think of President Trump, they argue, he has exposed the frailty of the Republican Party, which tried and failed to stop his nomination. The party has since bent on core issues, especially those related to the Russia investigation. Both the Republican and the Democratic parties, scholars argue, have grown dangerously weak, unable to play their informal but crucial role as institutional checks on power; as guardrails of democracy. That was on our minds when we arrived in Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl, a million-person suburb of Mexico City, which has effectively seceded from Mexico’s party system. Neza, as it is known, is gritty and working class, a sprawl of short concrete buildings. But it is a quiet success story. As crime and corruption skyrocket nationally, especially in surrounding areas, they’ve remained stable or even declined here. When we asked Neza locals and officials how they did it, they pointed to Jorge Amador, the police chief who looks and talks as if he wandered into the job after getting lost on his way to a faculty meeting. Mr. Amador, whose background is in sociology and water management, imposed policy changes that, sweeping and sometimes eccentric, might be impossible elsewhere. He set up literature programs and chess classes. He restructured the force to emphasize community engagement. He fired 100-plus officers suspected of corruption or brutality. So was Mr. Amador the key to Neza’s success? After some time in Neza (and a lot of time with Mexican academics), we came to a different conclusion. Or, at least, a broader one. Neza’s secret was breaking from the Mexican party system, which is what made Mr. Amador’s hiring and reforms possible. Mexico’s establishment political parties are beyond troubled. They are a dangerous combination of superstrong — they are tightly controlled institutions that have few career civil servants — and super-weak. They are riven with corruption, patronage and nepotism. They have the power to enforce internal loyalty but not to perform basic institutional functions. “You don’t have any institution or agency that is capable of forcing the parties to cooperate and forcing them to be honest and fair. And that is a huge problem,” said Joy Langston, a political scientist at the CIDE, a Mexico City university. “They are very much able to negotiate reforms that make them even stronger and give them even more distance from voters,” she said, adding that this means parties have shrinking incentive to think about policies that will help voters, or to think about policy at all. Neza is different; it is run by the left-wing P.R.D. party, rather than either of the establishment parties. Most P.R.D. holds are not like Neza. They, too, see upticks in crime and corruption. But because the P.R.D. exists outside of the mainstream party system, an official like Mr. Amador is at least freer to root out corruption or experiment with unorthodox reforms. At the same time, however, he cannot turn for help or policy expertise from state or federal institutions. So he is walking a tightrope without a net. And not all of his policies have worked. After years of relatively undisturbed experimentation, Neza has become something like an open-air experiment in social engineering. The goal is to so enamor the police of their civic responsibility that they will decide to refuse the money they could make extorting civilians or aiding drug gangs, as is common in much of Mexico. In August, we attended one of the twice-annual awards ceremonies that Mr. Amador holds for the police. Of the 700 officers in attendance, half would receive some sort of prize and cash reward. Family members in the audience waved supportive signs. In an Oprah-style twist, and to cheers even she might envy, six officers were each granted bonuses worth four months pay. It felt like a pep rally. “At the beginning, people don’t trust you, they are very defensive,” said Diana Hernandez, one of the community officers assigned to monitor a small patch of streets — another experiment. She understands, she said. Growing up, her family rarely called the police, seeing them as bound to bring more trouble. Now, she said, “People recognize me on the street. That they know me really makes me feel good about this.” Neighborhood watch groups, set up to coordinate with police, are provided with police cameras, alarm systems and direct lines to the patrol cars. But their longer-term purpose, Mr. Amador said, is to create public buy-in for his reforms “so that it doesn’t matter who’s in the mayor’s office.” In a way, he is seeking to replicate the functions of a political party: grass-roots mobilization, civil society allies and institutionalized policies. It’s a big idea, but a reminder that trying to reform the police and society without real institutional support is a bit like writing in the sand. “It’s fragile, this experiment,” Guillermo Valdés, a former head of the national intelligence agency, said. Establishing it “has been a long process and a slow one,” requiring time and freedom that doesn’t exist for most Mexican officials constrained by the party system. Policing experts we spoke to generally gave Neza high marks, as did Mr. Valdés. Juan Salgado, also with the CIDE, said the city had achieved “great successes,” in part by sidestepping civil society organizations, which, like so much in Mexico, tend to dominated by the establishment parties. Still, not everyone has been sold. Antia Mendoza, a Mexico City-based security expert, said Neza’s officials had not proven a link between Mr. Amador’s reforms and the crime rate. And she saw little proof the community networks were working. And Neza is hardly an oasis of safety. The day before the police awards, our photographer visited Neza to find the main traffic circle shut down by a public brawl. When we spent some time in the police command center, which includes dozens of new-looking TV screens displaying feeds from hundreds of street cameras, the officers watched helplessly as a car chase zipped across the screens. Still, in a way, the most important thing may not be how well Mr. Amador’s reforms worked but the fact that he had space to try them at all, and for years at a time. That level of freedom, particularly to purge corruption, is rare in Mexican policymaking. It’s a major problem for Mexico, constricting officials in a time of national crisis. That, for us, was Neza’s lesson: not the presence of reforms, but the absence of party-imposed constraints. It made us look differently at the rest of Mexico, where those constraints can be suffocating. It made us think about Europe’s mainstream parties, which are the least popular they’ve been in years, giving rise to smaller and less professionalized fringe parties. It made us think about the global rise in populist parties, which often reject policy expertise and institutions as untrustworthy “deep state” elites. And it made us think about American parties that have been hollowed out by polarization and other factors. Mexico’s political parties are, in many ways, particular to Mexico and its history. They are legacies of the country’s revolutionary past and its recent emergence from single-party rule. The degree to which they are failing is exceptional.

1787\Politics\ATHENS — Greek lawmakers on Monday approved new measures demanded by international creditors, including cuts to benefits for large families and restrictions on trade unions, creating the basis for additional bailout funding. Addressing Parliament, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who backed the legislation, said the vote would move Greece a step closer to emerging from its third international bailout, which expires in August. “We are a breath away from the end of the program and the definitive end to the memorandums,” Mr. Tsipras said, referring to the three loan agreements Greece has signed with foreign creditors since it verged on bankruptcy in 2010. “This gives hope and courage to millions of our fellow citizens who all these years have made large sacrifices and now finally see light and a way out,” Mr. Tsipras said, referring to years of pension cuts and tax increases. Mr. Tsipras’s political rival, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the leader of the New Democracy party, accused the government of “lies,” saying the promise for a “clean exit” in August was baseless because foreign supervision of Greece’s financial health would continue. Before the vote, about 20,000 demonstrators gathered in central Athens, the capital, for a mostly peaceful protest demonstration. The exception was a small group of hooded youths who hurled firebombs at police officers. The police responded by firing tear gas. There was no public transportation in the capital as workers walked off the job and unionists threatened to call more strikes in the coming weeks. Some public services, including state hospitals and schools, were disrupted as well, as teachers and doctors participated in brief walkouts in solidarity with unions. The legislation passed with 154 votes in the 300-seat Parliament, overcoming objections by lawmakers reluctant to impose yet more hardship on a nation struggling to return to growth after years of belt-tightening. Support for the legislation also overcame vehement opposition from labor unions, whose members took to the streets of the capital to denounce the government’s “savage austerity.” Besides the 153 lawmakers who backed the legislation, an independent deputy supported the bill and said she would join Mr. Tsipras’s leftist Syriza Party, strengthening his coalition’s slim majority. Unlike some earlier austerity measures, the latest package does not further cut pensions or raise taxes. But it does reduce benefits to families with more than three children and requires unions to gather more votes from members before they can call strikes. The new measures also are aimed at eliminating what has become a chaotic arena for anti-austerity protests — property foreclosures at Greek courthouses. Now those proceedings can be conducted online, which avoids the threats and harassment faced by notaries, who had conducted the foreclosures in court. Greece’s international creditors have demanded more austerity in exchange for at least 5 billion euros in bailout funds, possibly as much as 7 billion euros. Eurozone finance ministers are scheduled to meet on Jan. 22 to decide on the disbursement of the money. If satisfied with Greece’s progress, they are also expected to discuss relief for the country’s huge debt burden, which is nearly twice the size of its annual economic output. A deal to lighten Greece’s debt would be a boon for Mr. Tsipras, who has faced scathing criticism for the compromises he has made to creditors since coming to power three years ago on a pledge to reduce austerity.\-0.10160854458808899,0.7304964661598206,-0.6583017706871033,-0.17241692543029785,-0.0064491694793105125,-0.4084898829460144,0.4380541443824768,-0.30382540822029114,-2.0814239978790283,0.16538266837596893,-0.005132652819156647,1.107092022895813,0.2913398742675781,0.8122509717941284,0.18954576551914215,-0.39715108275413513,-0.006299339700490236,1.310634970664978,-0.4355548024177551,-0.09715523570775986,0.06253589689731598,0.7702972292900085,-0.426824152469635,0.5675904750823975,-0.5886189937591553,0.9160051345825195,0.2497030645608902,0.5061020851135254,0.704947292804718,0.20972734689712524,-0.408418744802475,0.6969716548919678,0.40348830819129944,-1.167222261428833,0.2654578685760498,-0.5844842791557312,-0.7987772226333618,-0.013034197501838207,0.12004466354846954,-0.6728782653808594,-1.1453465223312378,-0.005094395950436592,-0.6727425456047058,-0.4683018922805786,-0.8142122626304626,0.5384128093719482,0.3551979660987854,0.4548112750053406,-0.28370025753974915,0.6231022477149963,0.5810548663139343,-0.23581553995609283,0.05138875171542168,-0.2695854604244232,0.08857997506856918,-0.8065976500511169,0.8506720662117004,-0.47901421785354614,-1.954552173614502,0.5637645125389099,-0.20381689071655273,0.844018280506134,1.1927427053451538,0.9020757675170898,-0.4774688482284546,0.677852213382721,0.24674758315086365,1.3368175029754639,0.9620758295059204,0.9547858834266663,1.4568355083465576,0.47712430357933044,-0.308819442987442,-0.041281379759311676,-2.3692626953125,0.5652432441711426,0.3850528299808502,0.008073507808148861,0.10646521300077438,0.15348991751670837,0.7586227655410767,-1.0384891033172607,-1.055609107017517,-0.1990160197019577,0.5520785450935364,0.7443913817405701,0.5826968550682068,-0.5549662113189697,0.7263818383216858,0.12880434095859528,-0.11452079564332962,0.06321021169424057,-1.381937026977539,0.8246584534645081,-0.7211233377456665,0.22085611522197723,-0.030386272817850113,-1.2423043251037598,-0.12348958849906921,0.7556143999099731\NYTIMES\Greece Adopts New Austerity Measures to Placate Creditors\2018-01-16 00:51:34.0\
1788\Politics\HONG KONG — A 140-member North Korean pop orchestra will stage rare performances in South Korea during the Winter Olympics next month, the two Koreas agreed on Monday. The two sides discussed details of the North’s participation in the Games as part of their efforts to improve ties. The orchestra, known as the Samjiyon Band, one of the North’s top arts troupes, will enter South Korea by crossing over at Panmunjom, a border village, and will perform twice in the South: once in Seoul, the South Korean capital, and once in Gangneung, a city on the east coast where some of the Olympic competitions will be held. The troupe’s performances will feature 80 orchestra musicians and 60 members who sing and dance. Many of them are young women who have been allowed to adopt a more lively style and modern costumes, like short skirts, under the North’s young leader, Kim Jong-un. But like all art troupes in the North, Samjiyon remains a tool of propaganda for Mr. Kim’s government, which uses music, movies, paintings and novels to disseminate the state’s ideology and inspire loyalty to its leadership. It and the better-known Moranbong Band have performed in numerous state art performances where Mr. Kim’s policies, as well as his missile and nuclear tests, have been celebrated. Hyon Song-wol, a top singer with Moranbong, often considered Mr. Kim’s favorite band, participated in border talks on Monday. The art troupe would be larger than the previous six that North Korea has sent to South Korea since 1985. The North last sent such a group in 2002, when 30 North Korean singers and dancers performed in Seoul to celebrate Korea’s liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945. Scenes of young North Korean artists performing for South Korean audiences could have huge implications. They could be moments of rare inter-Korean reconciliation after a year of high tensions over the North’s nuclear and long-range missile tests. Or the event could be a source of bitter controversy in the South, depending on what songs the North Korean artists perform. To avoid having the orchestra performances become a political controversy, South Korean negotiators are expected to insist that the North Korean artists not sing songs or use stage props that would surely cause ire among South Koreans, including any references to, or images of, North Korean missiles. During the talks on Monday, the North promised to play traditional Korean folk songs that “fit the mood for unification and are well known on both sides,” as well as classical music, said the chief South Korean delegate, Lee Woo-sung. Mr. Lee said more discussions were expected to work out other details of North Korean performances. The South Korean government said it hoped that the North Korean orchestra would “contribute to improving relations and recovering the cultural homogeneity.” Both sides have not decided whether the North Koreans will hold any joint concerts with a South Korean orchestra. After years of denouncing the South as an American stooge, Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, used his New Year’s Day speech to propose a dialogue to discuss his country’s participation in the Winter Olympics being held in the South Korean town of Pyeongchang beginning Feb. 7. South Korea quickly embraced the idea as a way to calm tensions and dispel fears of a possible war on the divided peninsula spurred by the North’s nuclear and missile tests and President Trump’s frequent threats to destroy the North should it pose harm to the Americans and their allies. In border talks held at Panmunjom last week, the two sides agreed that North Korea would send athletes and cheerleaders, as well as an art troupe, journalists and a taekwondo demonstration team. Working-level negotiators met at Panmunjom on Monday to sort out the details. The South Korean government also said that the two Koreas had agreed in principle to field a joint women’s ice hockey team. The International Olympic Committee is scheduled to discuss the proposal when it brings together Olympic officials from both Koreas in Switzerland on Saturday to discuss the North’s last-minute decision to join the Olympics. If approved, it would be the Koreas’ first unified Olympic team ever and the first joint Korean team in an international sporting event since the two Koreas competed together in an international table tennis championship and a youth soccer tournament in 1991.\1.0333908796310425,-0.12118834257125854,-0.6228484511375427,0.007715772837400436,-0.44378629326820374,0.1501026451587677,2.17254376411438,-0.11954028159379959,0.37151801586151123,-1.4109532833099365,1.117294192314148,1.930584192276001,1.5345090627670288,0.4251568615436554,-1.761674165725708,-0.18481868505477905,-0.41308799386024475,-0.5821543335914612,0.4527374505996704,-0.1599644273519516,-0.18162791430950165,-0.4765949547290802,0.23841288685798645,0.7035096883773804,0.3016450107097626,-0.236066535115242,0.5896062850952148,1.324254035949707,-0.09774362295866013,-0.9475279450416565,0.14968033134937286,1.170051097869873,-0.025932608172297478,0.5487387180328369,-0.38009947538375854,0.07887499034404755,-0.4906696081161499,-0.6391447186470032,1.069078803062439,-0.5875435471534729,-0.4711693227291107,-0.9959220886230469,1.061577558517456,-0.020263860002160072,-1.0122472047805786,0.22670455276966095,0.377700537443161,-0.09522319585084915,-1.4016858339309692,-0.8581932187080383,1.0631775856018066,0.7937674522399902,1.065248727798462,-0.6401391625404358,0.736802339553833,-1.9845449924468994,1.7990390062332153,0.06907918304204941,-1.4751248359680176,0.961387574672699,0.6231735944747925,0.8221869468688965,0.363598495721817,-0.7151853442192078,-1.0883753299713135,1.004003643989563,2.0769705772399902,-0.45100104808807373,-0.8885475397109985,0.6441418528556824,0.330261766910553,0.36432120203971863,-0.19006499648094177,0.33414599299430847,-0.7406432628631592,-1.2133030891418457,0.10724270343780518,-1.2289315462112427,-0.05363253504037857,-0.9785377383232117,0.9840328097343445,0.5708056092262268,-0.03943825513124466,-0.14265601336956024,0.4110732674598694,-1.0371392965316772,0.16926071047782898,-0.8913595676422119,-0.8804801106452942,-0.2551729381084442,-1.3702378273010254,0.6698049902915955,-2.475717544555664,-0.9827165007591248,-0.5231701135635376,-5.309171974658966E-4,-0.4745864272117615,-0.9922794103622437,-1.1175098419189453,0.5238007307052612\NYTIMES\North Korean Orchestra Plans to Perform in South Korea During Winter Olympics\2018-01-16 04:47:07.0\1574, 1768, 1788
1789\Science\Manmade climate change is now dwarfing the influence of natural trends on the climate, scientists say. Last year was the second or third hottest year on record - after 2016 and on a par with 2015, the data shows. But those two years were affected by El Niño - the natural phenomenon centred on the tropical Pacific Ocean which works to boost temperatures worldwide. What is remarkable about 2017 is that it was so warm without feeling the influence of an El Niño. The acting director of the UK Met Office, Prof Peter Stott, told BBC News: "It's extraordinary that temperatures in 2017 have been so high when there's no El Niño. In fact, we’ve been going into cooler La Niña conditions. "Last year was substantially warmer than 1998 which had a very big El Niño. "It shows clearly that the biggest natural influence on the climate is being dwarfed by human activities – predominantly CO₂ emissions." Prof Dave Reay from the University of Edinburgh added: "When even the 'colder' years are rewriting the warmest-year record books - we know we have a problem. "Global temperatures will continue to bob up and down from year to year, but the climate tide beneath them is rising fast." Figures were published on Thursday by the world’s three main agencies monitoring global temperatures: the UK Met Office and the two US organisations - the US space agency (Nasa) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). Their datasets are compiled from many thousands of temperature measurements taken across the globe, from all continents and all oceans. Temperatures for 2017 and 2015 are virtually identical. Nasa rates 2017 the second hottest year, and Noaa and the Met Office judge it the third hottest since records began in 1850. The Met Office HadCRUT4 global temperature series shows that 2017 was 0.99C (±0.1C) above "pre-industrial" levels – that’s taken as the average over the period 1850-1900. It was 0.38 (±0.1C) above the 1981-2010 average. The Exeter-based agency calculates that the El Niño event spanning 2015-2016 contributed around 0.2C to the annual average for 2016. But that influence was gone by 2017. The World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said the long-term temperature trend was far more important than the ranking of individual years. "That trend is an upward one," he said. “Seventeen of the 18 warmest years on record have all been during this century, and the degree of warming during the past three years has been exceptional. “Arctic warmth has been especially pronounced and this will have profound and long-lasting repercussions on sea levels, and on weather patterns in other parts of the world.” Prof Tim Osborn from the University of East Anglia said climate models were now accurately predicting which places would warm fastest. He explained: “We’re seeing greater warming over land and in the Arctic regions, and less warming in the sub-polar oceans. “These are what we expect from our understanding of climate physics, and this is what we observe.” He said uncertainties arising from incomplete global coverage of weather stations had been included in the calculations. Commenting on the figures, Bob Ward, from the Grantham Institute at the London School of Economics, pointed out that this year governments were due to start assessing the gap between their collective ambitions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the goals of the Paris climate agreement, to stabilise temperature rise below 2C, and as close to 1.5 as possible. “The record temperature should focus the minds of world leaders, including President Trump, on the scale and urgency of the risks that people, rich and poor, face around the world from climate change," he said. Earlier this week, a study in the journal Nature concluded that climate change needed urgently to be tackled, but forecast that apocalyptic predictions of a temperature rise of 6C by 2100 would not come about. Prof Richard Allan from the University of Reading said: “Rather than warming being inconsequential or catastrophic, as some have suggested, we can be sure societies are facing a dangerous temperature rise, but one which we still have time to fix. “The conclusions confirm that human-caused climate change is a serious concern. “But if we act now with sustained and substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, societies will still be able to avoid much of the most dangerous climate change predicted by computer simulations.” Other temperature analyses exist apart from the "big three", but these all tell broadly the same narrative. The European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting issued its bulletin on 4 January. It called 2017 as the second warmest on record.

1790\Science\A mass die-off of wild antelopes in Kazakhstan was triggered by environmental factors, scientists believe. More than 200,000 saiga antelopes collapsed and died suddenly in 2015, wiping out most of the global population. The deaths were found to be caused by a bacterial infection. However, new data shows other factors were involved too, including unusually high humidity and temperatures. Researchers think changing environmental conditions could be a trigger for the bacterial onslaught, although this needs further research. They say there is a high chance of the same thing happening again, given climate change predictions for the region. Study leader Prof Richard Kock of the Royal Veterinary College London was part of the original emergency response team. He said the event went way beyond what would normally be expected from a bacterial disease of this kind. "The whole thing was really extraordinary," he said. "It's very very likely to happen again." The multi-disciplinary team used statistical analysis to look at environmental conditions at the time. They found that there were unusually warm temperatures and high humidity in the days leading up to the wildlife deaths. The same was found for two previous mass die-offs of antelopes in 1981 and 1988 in central Asia. The mechanisms by which climate factors triggered this bacterial attack remain unknown, and require future research, they say. A link with climate had been noted before, but, "this is the first concrete evidence", said Prof Kock. There is an urgent need for mitigation of other risks to the critically-endangered animal, such as poaching and the spread of diseases from livestock, he added. "There's theoretically a possibility of extinction of the species entirely," he said. "We have at least got a number of populations - albeit small ones - that are outside the danger zone." Other wildlife, such as reindeer, could also be susceptible to mass die-offs, scientists believe. The antelopes all died within days of each other over a large area of central Kazakhstan. It later emerged that the most likely cause was blood poisoning from a bacterium found naturally in saiga antelopes, which is usually harmless. Co-researcher Steffen Zuther of the Frankfurt Zoological Society/Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity of Kazakhstan said mass mortality events are a major threat for the saiga antelope and can wipe out many years of conservation work in a few days. "The triggering of such mass mortality events in saiga through weather conditions shows that not much can be done to prevent them occurring, and therefore how important it is to maintain saiga populations of sufficient size for the species to survive such catastrophes," he explained. "The event was simply catastrophic for the long-term survival of this critically endangered species," said Nida Al Fulaij of the wildlife charity, PTES, which funded some of the rescue work. The saiga antelope lives on the grasslands of Central Asia in large herds of up to a thousand individuals. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature says the animal is at risk from illegal hunting for horns used in Chinese traditional medicine, as well as from habitat loss and grassland fires. The research is published in the journal, Science Advances.

1791\Science\A monkey from Ethiopia and Sudan with a "handlebar moustache" has been identified as a distinct species. Scientists took a fresh look at the distribution and physical appearance of patas monkeys in Ethiopia, confirming there were two species rather than one. It was originally described as a separate species in 1862, but was later folded in - incorrectly - with other patas monkeys to form a single species. Details have been published in the journal Primate Conservation. Patas monkeys are found from west to east across sub-Saharan Africa; they are among the fastest-moving of ground-dwelling monkeys - able to reach speeds of about 55 km/h (34 mph). Spartaco Gippoliti, from the IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group, reassessed the species status of patas monkeys in the Blue Nile region of Ethiopia and Sudan. His analysis led him to revive the classification of the Blue Nile patas monkey (Erythrocebus poliophaeus) first proposed more than 150 years ago. That designation was dropped in 1927, when the German zoologist Ernst Schwarz rearranged the primate group's taxonomy and decided there was just one species. The newly recognised, bewhiskered primate lives in the Blue Nile basin in western Ethiopia and neighbouring Sudan, and geographically separated from other patas monkeys by Sudan's Sudd swampy region and the Ethiopian highlands. Their faces and noses are black and they lack the characteristic band between the ear and eye found on other patas monkeys. Mr Gippoliti commented: "The basic concept of the genus Erythrocebus was unchanged for about 100 years now, and the discovery of a distinct species living in eastern Sudan and western Ethiopia will put in the spotlight a little-known region of Africa, offering opportunities for new conservation projects in the area." Anthony Rylands, from the conservation group Global Wildlife Conservation, commented: "There is notable variation in these remarkable primates. It's only through this kind of painstaking research that we get a proper handle on their diversity so that we can more effectively protect these species from the threats they face." Several other discoveries are described in the same issue of Primate Conservation, including a new dwarf lemur in Madagascar, two new tarsiers in Indonesia, and two new sub-species of slender loris in Sri Lanka.

1792\Science\Finnish start-up ICEYE has released a "first light" image from its novel radar satellite, which was launched to orbit last Friday. The picture depicts a region of Alaska incorporating Noatak National Preserve. ICEYE is taking a radical new approach to satellite radar, shrinking the size of what have traditionally been big, power-hungry spacecraft into a volume similar to that of a suitcase. The Helsinki-based firm plans to launch a large network of these platforms. This will enable multiple radar images a day to be acquired over the same location on Earth - a service that has not previously been available. Pictures acquired with a synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) instrument like the one hosted on the ICEYE-X1 satellite show features on the ground even under night conditions and in the presence of cloud cover. It is a powerful tool that the Finnish company wants to make available to new users beyond just the conventional government and military markets. ICEYE believes it can make this happen because of its low-cost approach. One of its suitcase-sized satellites can be made for a couple of million dollars versus the more than 200 million price tag that would be common for its large predecessors. ICEYE-X1 went into orbit last Friday aboard the Indian space agency's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. The first light image just realised was taken on Monday. The full picture transmitted to the ground was over 1.2GB in size and encompasses an area of roughly 80km x 40km. ICEYE-X1 obtained the image in the span of 10 seconds as it travelled at a speed of more than 7.5km/s and at an altitude exceeding 500km. The picture renders objects as small as 10m across. ICEYE wants eventually to get this resolution down to 3m. "With this single image, the ICEYE-X1 mission is already a full success regarding our most important goals, but this is just the beginning," said Rafal Modrzewski, CEO and co-founder of ICEYE. "We are now working to increase the range of incidence angles and to more than double the ground resolution for ICEYE-X2. We are looking forward to launching our next mission as soon as this summer."\0.5348138213157654,0.45194578170776367,-0.012635326012969017,-1.061131238937378,-0.5355802178382874,-0.19013072550296783,0.5614368915557861,0.42135003209114075,-0.5617685914039612,0.14634907245635986,0.09827927500009537,0.3227976858615875,-0.529608964920044,0.24577052891254425,-0.8073633313179016,0.5564002394676208,-0.33478686213493347,0.33304157853126526,0.3363916575908661,-0.5927003026008606,0.3362073004245758,-0.6500475406646729,0.1060674637556076,-0.5706082582473755,-0.2665448486804962,0.41903504729270935,-0.06110334023833275,0.3981240689754486,0.899732232093811,1.1085549592971802,-0.17065563797950745,0.1314627230167389,-0.8537322878837585,-0.17730355262756348,-0.3098786771297455,-0.7333224415779114,-0.037758391350507736,-0.7303286194801331,-0.041751496493816376,0.7332494258880615,-0.2463291734457016,-0.4984751343727112,0.8922855854034424,0.4766692519187927,-0.35154253244400024,0.1239842027425766,0.744891345500946,0.8123309016227722,-0.23422257602214813,-0.308713436126709,0.2302439659833908,0.22953420877456665,0.03843796253204346,0.3989803194999695,0.43297043442726135,-0.3906383216381073,0.011772854253649712,0.34669312834739685,-0.4383354187011719,0.15076260268688202,0.8115913271903992,-0.7323287129402161,0.368882417678833,0.6689098477363586,-0.10794952511787415,0.41637080907821655,0.7045618295669556,0.8692523837089539,0.6013244986534119,0.2671230733394623,0.10464812070131302,0.6281673908233643,-0.9623127579689026,0.5919587016105652,0.22806788980960846,-0.01642850786447525,0.021050794050097466,-0.18163375556468964,-0.8603429794311523,-0.4336221218109131,0.3445362150669098,-0.27610883116722107,0.11303940415382385,0.3861040771007538,-0.07922978699207306,0.38932475447654724,0.5098819732666016,-0.05179385095834732,-0.7361220121383667,-0.4915180802345276,-1.1057506799697876,1.095335602760315,-0.34337782859802246,0.3847338557243347,-0.9808882474899292,0.8496968746185303,-0.3863424062728882,0.3425619602203369,-0.1371048241853714,1.0769684314727783\BBC\ICEYE's 'suitcase space radar' returns first image\2018-01-17 18:55:14.0\
1793\Science\"Incredible" images of DNA in action have been captured by scientists who will use them to design cancer drugs. Researcher Dr Alessandro Vannini said the pictures were "beautiful" and in artistic comparisons were "definitely a Van Gogh". They capture a fundamental part of all plant and animal life, called RNA polymerase III, reading the genetic instructions contained in DNA. It is a process that gets hijacked by cancer. Human DNA contains the genetic instructions for building and running the human body. It is RNA polymerase III's job to come along and read the genetic instruction manual. The team at the Institute of Cancer Research used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy, which won the 2017 Nobel Prize for chemistry for revolutionising biochemistry. They purified RNA polymerase III, immersed it in water and then rapidly froze it. This preserves the microscopic structure of objects and even captures them mid-movement. A beam of electrons is then used to take images from lots of angles, which are then built up into a detailed 3D image. Dr Alessandro Vannini, who published the findings in the journal Nature, told the BBC: "You don't get the structure all at once, you just see individual strokes and it takes a while to see the big picture. "It was definitely a Van Gogh." The researchers caught the molecular machinery binding to DNA, unzipping it and reading the information in the genetic code. RNA polymerase III is involved in the supply of building materials needed to make proteins. A cancerous cell that is dividing rapidly and out of control needs more, and different, building materials than a normal healthy cell. Changes to RNA polymerase III have often been implicated in cancer. Dr Vannini told the BBC: "It's very highly regulated, but it is very often hijacked in cancer and there is a complete shift in the building blocks." But now the structure of RNA polymerase III and the way it interacts with DNA has been worked out, the team plan to design drugs to alter the way it works. Dr Vannini said: "It's a new way of thinking and targeting very central machinery. If we block it completely then all cells will die, but if we can block it partially we can see if we can stop cancers." Prof Paul Workman, the chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: "This beautiful study has unveiled a fundamental cog in the inner workings of cells and one that is often exploited by cancers. "It's a hugely important finding in cell biology, and I hope that in future it will lead to new treatments for cancer patients." Dr Amanda Collis, from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, said: "This exciting discovery demonstrates how fundamental understanding of biological systems can open the door to the development of potential new cancer therapies."

1794\Science\Three-fifths of new cars must be electric by 2030 to meet greenhouse gas targets, ministers have been warned. Homes also need to be built to a higher standard, the Committee on Climate Change - the official watchdog - says. The government says the UK is cutting emissions faster than any other G7 nation - and the committee agrees there has been a big shift under Theresa May. However, it says the UK will fall short of its ambitions unless ministers do more to turn pledges into reality. The warning comes less than a week after the prime minister launched a 25-year plan to protect the environment, including eradicating all avoidable plastic waste by 2042. The committee agrees the government's recently-published Clean Growth Plan is a big improvement, and says the UK has been a world leader in cutting emissions so far. But it argues that the plan still doesn't offer detailed policies to meet legal carbon targets. Carbon capture from industry must be made to happen, it says, and wood and plastics should be banned from landfill in order to re-use them. More trees should be planted to soak up carbon dioxide, with a view to creating 70,000 hectares (173,000 acres) of new woodland by 2025, and farming must do more to cut emissions. Industry, too, is urged to take greater responsibility. The committee's chairman Lord Deben, told BBC News: "If you're going to sell an electric car your dealers have got to understand these things, so training dealers is essential. "If you're running a big fossil fuel company, you have to start thinking about the realities of when, not if, because it is not if any longer, we use a lot less fossil fuels." He also criticised construction firms for only doing the "absolute minimum" required on building energy efficient homes. The committee points out that better insulated homes would cut people's bills as well as tackle climate change, and calls for more incentives to encourage "able to pay" households to install efficiency measures. Lord Deben said the Clean Growth Strategy had "changed the tone" of the government on the issue. "These issues have been put into the centre of government policy - that's a major change." But, he said, ambitions alone are not enough. "The strategy doesn't deliver enough action to meet emissions targets in the 2020s and 2030s," he said. "The government's policies will need to be firmed up as a matter of urgency and supplemented with additional measures if the UK is to deliver on legal commitments and secure its position as an international climate change leader." He added: "All departments now need to look at their contribution towards cutting emissions - including the Department for Transport." The committee wants 30% to 70% of new cars to be ultra-low emission by 2030, as well as up to 40% of new vans, as part of efforts to phase out sales of conventional petrol and diesel versions by 2040. Currently, fewer than 5% of new car sales are "alternatively fuelled", which also includes hybrid models. Prof Michael Grubb, from University College London, said: "There are plenty of good ideas out there on low-carbon energy, cutting emissions from buildings, clean transport and more, but as the committee rightly points out, concrete plans need to be put in place, and soon. "The government is making all the right noises on support for the low-carbon economy, but these must be turned into action: we need a year of decision-making." Richard Black, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, agreed: "We're not on track to meet emissions goals that kick in in just five years' time. "That leaves ministers little time for enquiries and consultations - they're going to have to put new policies in place fast." Mr Black suggested quick-win policies including: cutting company car tax for electric vehicles; repealing the ban on onshore wind power (the cheapest form of electricity generation), and re-starting the programme for Zero Carbon Homes. A business department spokesperson said: "The scrutiny of the independent Committee on Climate Change plays an important role. "The UK has reduced emissions on a per-person basis faster than any other G7 nation, and our clean growth strategy is the next ambitious milestone in our work to de-carbonise the UK. "We have always said it is only the start of a process. "Our proposals will continue to evolve - whether in response to costs of renewable energy coming down, improved evidence about climate change, wider trends in technology or the economic opportunities delivered through our industrial strategy."

1795\Science\A UK-headquartered company says it has won a contract to send spacecraft to dock with two existing satellites to extend their lives. Effective Space will not name the satellites' owner at this stage - only that it is a major regional operator. The deal is described as being worth more than $100m ($70m). Effective Space says its two servicing "Space Drones" will be built using manufacturing expertise in the UK and from across the rest of Europe. The pair, which will each be sized about the same as a washing machine and weigh less than 400kg, are expected to launch on the same rocket sometime in 2020. Once in orbit, they will separate and attach themselves to the two different geostationary telecommunications satellites that are almost out of fuel. The drones, using their own propulsion systems, will then take over station-keeping duties 36,000km above the Earth, ensuring the satellites can continue to point in the right direction to transmit their signals. Satellite servicing has been talked about as a commercial enterprise for more than decade, but it is only now that the first projects are really coming to market. The American operator Intelsat, for example, is buying a similar service from manufacturer Orbital ATK. The latter's initial "Mission Extension Vehicle" should launch later this year. Daniel Campbell, the managing director of Effective Space, told BBC News: "While in-orbit servicing has been preached for the last 10 years, the main challenge has been to come up with a solution where the cost [of the space drone] is significantly less than a replacement satellite." Today's big telecommunications satellites can cost upwards of $300m over their 15-year design lives. For a much more modest outlay, an operator can extend this timeframe with one of Effective Space's drones, so maintaining revenues. The London-based company's initial focus is on station-keeping, but future markets for similar types of servicing vehicle will almost certainly open up for satellite removal. Orbits above the Earth are becoming congested, and experts say old and broken hardware needs to be brought out of the sky if the environment is to remain stable. Effective Space is part of the wave of so-called "new space" companies that have sprung up in recent years. Their goal is to drive novel business opportunities and applications off the back of lower-cost systems enabled in large part by the greater use of off-the-shelf consumer electronics and step-change manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing. It is an approach that has found fertile ground in Britain, with supporting government policies promoted through the UK Space Agency. This has drawn a number of foreign initiatives to base themselves in Britain. Effective Space, for example, has its roots in Israel and maintains R&D facilities there, but the UK is the place it wants to make its operations centre. "We are deploying a very innovative service and the only way you can do that is by being able to rely on very solid space law and a supportive space agency," said Mr Campbell. "And since the Brexit vote, actually, we are seeing more support, more proactive moves, to ensure we're on the right track. There is a tailwind in the UK that allows space companies to thrive." A UK Space Agency spokesperson commented: “The government’s Industrial Strategy set out how the UK can thrive in the commercial space age as technology evolves and innovative companies develop new products and services. "We engage regularly with these companies and offer a safe and competitive regulatory environment for new commercial ventures to support our growing space sector.”\0.5542965531349182,-0.8782820105552673,-1.5500860214233398,-0.08272658288478851,-0.1452876776456833,0.22319933772087097,0.46100708842277527,-0.8443530797958374,-1.521860957145691,-0.25529810786247253,0.7482752799987793,-0.03404245525598526,0.018701698631048203,0.17953157424926758,-0.6573854684829712,0.3416553735733032,-0.7553401589393616,-0.0967053472995758,-0.02593853883445263,0.4357617497444153,0.3353506326675415,-0.8403930068016052,0.17665697634220123,-1.3615751266479492,0.1815887689590454,0.2979819178581238,0.20104195177555084,0.30264899134635925,0.2730136811733246,0.6055219173431396,-0.7520915269851685,0.8804541826248169,-0.5318761467933655,-0.916010856628418,-0.026473622769117355,-1.0807108879089355,0.23509317636489868,-0.04876783862709999,1.237544059753418,-0.17466898262500763,-0.3658977448940277,-0.39467111229896545,0.3906307518482208,0.26269638538360596,-0.5968888401985168,0.9406100511550903,-0.6138838529586792,1.9287219047546387,-0.7783613801002502,-0.07833342999219894,1.1562583446502686,-0.5933619141578674,0.4827915132045746,0.2969006597995758,1.2366338968276978,-0.07935287803411484,-0.4732457399368286,0.153143510222435,0.015087706968188286,0.9088565111160278,-0.35965436697006226,0.23800678551197052,-0.15024560689926147,-0.16987395286560059,-0.7394179701805115,0.49091342091560364,0.3260197341442108,0.9871816039085388,-0.08436058461666107,0.39057397842407227,1.0404549837112427,0.3253907859325409,-0.663506805896759,-0.3376229405403137,-0.001735953614115715,0.37912502884864807,-0.18444129824638367,-0.22407257556915283,-0.967681348323822,-1.041391372680664,0.16629838943481445,0.27454131841659546,-0.8939583897590637,1.0048463344573975,0.860098659992218,1.0648211240768433,0.7351155281066895,-0.25071942806243896,-0.06714117527008057,0.13448266685009003,-0.7924923896789551,1.3166829347610474,0.01848364621400833,0.7369197607040405,0.04112260416150093,0.78839510679245,-0.08334771543741226,0.3881653845310211,-0.6515262722969055,0.8457558155059814\BBC\UK firm contracts to service satellites\2018-01-17 14:15:05.0\
1796\Science\Wild dolphins need up to 33,000 calories a day, researchers have found - equivalent to about 60 portions of salmon. In contrast, Olympic swimmers - who are smaller and less active - burn about 12,000 calories a day during training. Studying the metabolic rates of whales and dolphins is important for their conservation, say scientists. They found that a common bottlenose dolphin needs 10 to 25kg of fish each day to survive in the oceans. The study was carried out on common bottlenose dolphins living in Sarosota Bay off Florida. Adult and young dolphins were captured briefly to measure their resting metabolic rate. This provides an estimate of how much a dolphin needs to eat in a day, said Andreas Fahlman of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Oceanografic Foundation in Spain. "We can then add this up for all dolphins and estimate how much fish/prey they need," he said. "This may be vitally important when considering managing fisheries and making sure that the quota are not too high so that animals lack food." The researchers found that a 200 kg dolphin would burn between 16,500 and 33,000 calories a day, which is lower than expected. In contrast, an Olympic swimmer carrying out intensive exercise might need around 12,000 calories. For a dolphin, the amount of energy required depends on whether the animal is resting, sleeping, diving or swimming, as well as the temperature of the ocean. Finding out more about the diet and energy requirements of whales and dolphin will help in their conservation, say the researchers. They measured lung function in wild dolphins for the first time. "Lung function testing of wild populations in different areas of the world may help us understand respiratory health in wild populations," said Dr Fahlman. "We can use this as a health check of various populations and thereby the environment. If the dolphins are sick, there may be problems with the environment." The research is published in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

1797\Science\The Hubble telescope has bagged an unprecedented close-up view of one of the Universe's oldest known galaxies. Astronomers were lucky when the orbiting observatory captured the image of a galaxy that existed just 500 million years after the Big Bang. The image was stretched and amplified by the natural phenomenon of gravitational lensing, unlocking unprecedented detail. Such objects usually appear as tiny red spots to powerful telescopes. Distance and age are linked in astronomy; because of the time taken for light to traverse the vast expanse in-between, we see the galaxy as it was more than 13 billion years ago. The detail evident in the image will help scientists to test theories of galaxy evolution. "Pretty much every galaxy at that distance is an unresolved dot... it's kind of a matter of luck to get a galaxy that's lensed in just the right way to stretch it out and get that much detail - it's a pretty nice find," the study's lead author Brett Salmon told BBC News. Dr Salmon, from the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, added: "By analysing the effects of gravitational lensing on the image of this galaxy, we can determine its actual size and shape." The findings were presented at the 231st American Astronomical Society meeting in Washington DC. Gravitational lensing describes the way light is bent as it passes around a massive object between the source and an observer. This creates a kind of cosmic zoom lens, amplifying the image of a galaxy in the background. In this case, a huge galaxy cluster not only boosted the light from the more distant one but also smeared the image of it into an arc. "The lens is not unlike the bottom of a wine glass, distorting that background image," said Dr Salmon. The more ancient galaxy is relatively small, having about one-hundredth the mass of the Milky Way. It may be typical of the galaxies that emerged a relatively short time after the Big Bang. One key question for astronomers who study galaxy evolution concerns the origins of "discs" - a key component of the large-scale structure of many galaxies, including the Milky Way. Galactic discs are flat, rotating distributions of stars, gas, and dust. Dr Salmon commented: "We don't really know how the first galaxies in the Universe assembled those nice rotating discs in those beautiful images we see. So when did those discs actually start to form?" Another study presented here at the 231st AAS meeting described evidence for rotation in galaxies that existed about 800 million years after the Big Bang. That rotation could be indicative of the beginnings of disc formation. Renske Smit, from the University of Cambridge, and colleagues, used the Alma array in Chile to show that the gas in these newborn galaxies swirled and rotated in a whirlpool motion, similar to the Milky Way and other, more mature, galaxies much later in the Universe's history. "We expected that young galaxies would be dynamically 'messy', due to the havoc caused by exploding young stars, but these mini-galaxies show the ability to retain order and appear well regulated," said Dr Smit. "Despite their small size, they are already rapidly growing to become one of the 'adult' galaxies like we live in today." Expanding on why this was potentially important, Dr Salmon said: "Once the galaxy settles into a disc, that sets in motion the rest of the evolution of the galaxy. So finding out when that turbulent phase starts to settle down is a key initial condition." Computer simulations suggest that discs could be present in galaxies up to 600 million years after the Big Bang. The galaxy discovered with Hubble could be one of the first to possess one. This object is right at the limits of Hubble's detection capabilities, but the James Webb Space Telescope should be able to provide much more detail. Nasa's Webb observatory is due to launch on an Ariane rocket in 2019. "This galaxy is an exciting target for science with the Webb telescope as it offers the unique opportunity for resolving stellar populations in the very early Universe," explained Dr Salmon.

1798\Science\Rats were not to blame for the spread of plague during the Black Death, according to a study. The rodents and their fleas were thought to have spread a series of outbreaks in 14th-19th Century Europe. But a team from the universities of Oslo and Ferrara now says the first, the Black Death, can be "largely ascribed to human fleas and body lice". The study, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, uses records of its pattern and scale. The Black Death claimed an estimated 25 million lives, more than a third of Europe's population, between 1347 and 1351. "We have good mortality data from outbreaks in nine cities in Europe," Prof Nils Stenseth, from the University of Oslo, told BBC News. "So we could construct models of the disease dynamics [there]." He and his colleagues then simulated disease outbreaks in each of these cities, creating three models where the disease was spread by: In seven out of the nine cities studied, the "human parasite model" was a much better match for the pattern of the outbreak. It mirrored how quickly it spread and how many people it affected. "The conclusion was very clear," said Prof Stenseth. "The lice model fits best." "It would be unlikely to spread as fast as it did if it was transmitted by rats. "It would have to go through this extra loop of the rats, rather than being spread from person to person." Prof Stenseth said the study was primarily of historical interest - using modern understanding of disease to unpick what had happened during one of the most devastating pandemics in human history. But, he pointed out, "understanding as much as possible about what goes on during an epidemic is always good if you are to reduce mortality [in the future]". Plague is still endemic in some countries of Asia, Africa and the Americas, where it persists in "reservoirs" of infected rodents. According to the World Health Organization, from 2010 to 2015 there were 3,248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths. And, in 2001, a study that decoded the plague genome used a bacterium that had come from a vet in the US who had died in 1992 after a plague-infested cat sneezed on him as he had been trying to rescue it from underneath a house. "Our study suggests that to prevent future spread hygiene is most important," said Prof Stenseth. "It also suggests that if you're ill, you shouldn't come into contact with too many people. So if you're sick, stay at home."

1799\Science\Animal rights group Peta has launched an international campaign to try to end the mistreatment of working animals in the ancient city of Petra in Jordan. Peta says donkeys, horses and camels are beaten and forced to carry visitors in extreme heat without shade or water. Jordanian and international groups say they are already working with the animals' owners to improve conditions. They fear warning off tourists could prove counter-productive by depriving the animals' owners of income. Petra is one of the wonders of the world. Carved out of rock, the sudden entrance into the ancient Nabatean city through a narrow passage is breathtaking. It is the crown jewel of the Jordanian tourist industry. But there has long been concern about the treatment of the more than 1,300 working animals there. Donkeys haul tourists up 900 steep and eroded steps to the Monastery, a monument miraculously built out of rock on the mountainside. Horses, mules and camels carry tourists to the city and through it - some pulling carriages and carts - enduring beatings and lack of food and water as they do so. Jordanian organisations and their international partners have tried to improve their conditions at the Unesco World Heritage site. But Peta says nowhere near enough has been done. Last year, it amassed video and photographic evidence of cruelty to animals there, which showed deep wounds on many of the animals from chains and ropes tied around them. And now it is calling on the Jordanian authorities to take decisive action. It says the animals should be replaced by mechanised transport for tourists. It is also urging tour operators and hotels to shun the site until the abuses are stopped. But Unesco itself told the BBC that motorised vehicles would not be desirable there. The Princess Alia Foundation in Jordan and the international animal charity, Four Paws, said they were happy to work with any group to improve animal welfare. But they said they had already done much to improve the conditions for horses at Petra by providing new stables and ensuring their owners have sufficient food, water and shelter - as well as lighter carriages and more animal-friendly harnesses and saddles. They acknowledge there is more to do. But there is a concern in Jordan that a campaign warning off tourists from Petra could be counterproductive by damaging a major income source, as well as depriving the Bedouin community that has long owned the working animals of their livelihood, which could have an even more negative impact on their welfare. Peta though claims that only lip service has been paid to improving the lot of the animals. For example, it says it found that a sign at Petra asking tourists to report mistreatment leads to an email address that does not reply and a website that does not work.\0.3397887945175171,0.877043604850769,-0.8130336403846741,-0.22272339463233948,0.5349071025848389,0.14414547383785248,0.9375442266464233,-1.0232200622558594,-1.1495498418807983,-0.4472028613090515,0.6167412400245667,0.8422455191612244,-0.39273059368133545,-0.8723422288894653,-0.17419929802417755,-0.024700982496142387,-0.4513348639011383,0.04834961146116257,-0.8924260139465332,-0.28323474526405334,-0.4887467324733734,-0.017245780676603317,0.8788983821868896,-0.7784411907196045,-0.3341652750968933,-0.22239510715007782,0.5524584054946899,0.13478399813175201,0.9162764549255371,-0.22030940651893616,-0.09296087175607681,0.3993169665336609,0.1896456778049469,-0.9100632667541504,0.04612726345658302,-0.5117733478546143,0.342227965593338,-0.8705205321311951,0.2174985408782959,-1.0428348779678345,-0.5293000340461731,-0.8647334575653076,0.5388396382331848,-0.13292266428470612,-0.102768674492836,-0.13211998343467712,0.1886177957057953,-0.30307242274284363,-0.35035204887390137,-0.21435382962226868,0.5250121355056763,-0.08539260923862457,-0.10279130935668945,0.4556172788143158,0.764374852180481,-0.4201139807701111,0.17728951573371887,-0.4201752543449402,-0.6542436480522156,0.855303168296814,-0.026214929297566414,-0.4327881336212158,0.7743907570838928,-0.8428770899772644,-0.17192909121513367,0.30601024627685547,0.7897884249687195,1.0556834936141968,-0.2867361009120941,0.26984259486198425,0.17202717065811157,-0.5627291798591614,0.020176738500595093,-0.6811590790748596,-0.6248952746391296,-0.2531554400920868,0.11507171392440796,-0.06050609052181244,-1.599769949913025,-1.3896589279174805,0.44537463784217834,-0.6772157549858093,-1.078811764717102,0.7818743586540222,0.03689583018422127,0.4970867931842804,-0.19827575981616974,-0.5729520320892334,0.7627061009407043,0.5078822374343872,-0.5754693746566772,0.7189692854881287,0.02597901225090027,0.8565412759780884,0.60004061460495,0.559300422668457,0.6039056181907654,-0.6977631449699402,-1.2836843729019165,1.0002919435501099\BBC\Jordan urged to end animal mistreatment at Petra site\2018-01-16 11:35:18.0\
1800\Science\Fewer than one in 10 engineers in the UK is female - the lowest percentage in Europe, according to the Women's Engineering Society. Latvia, Bulgaria and Cyprus lead with nearly 30%. Here, two pioneering female engineers at Oxford University explain what drives them. Priyanka Dhopade was named as one of the top 50 Women in Engineering Under 35 in 2017, as chosen by the Women's Engineering Society. She grew up in Canada, where she studied for a degree in aerospace engineering. She completed a PhD at UNSW Canberra in Australia, before moving to Oxford in 2013. As a child I was very interested in aeroplanes, and how things fly in space - I wanted to be an astronaut. My parents suggested engineering, because it's quite practical. I could use my enthusiasm and my skills to do something that's real that matters. My research looks at the thermodynamics and the fluid dynamics of jet engine internal flows. I do a lot of computational fluid dynamics to look at the transfer of heat inside an engine and use those predictions to help design innovative cooling systems for modern jet engines. What that does is it helps to make the engine more efficient and safer as well, and reduces the environmental impact in terms of emissions and fuel consumption. If we help to make jet engines more efficient, that's going to have a huge environmental impact. The stereotype of an academic is someone who sits at their desk and doesn't talk to anybody and just scribbles away in their notebook. But I talk to so many experimentalists and work with them to help design these massive test facilities so that we can look at different aspects of the jet engine. I work with industry sponsors and get their input on the real problems that they are facing. I spend some time on the computer as well. I think that's also another thing that people don't realise, that in our modern digital world - engineering, a lot of it, is computer-based. It's not about wearing a hard hat and being on-site - although those roles are still available for those who are attracted to them. I try not to think about it on a daily basis because I'm quite busy and I'm doing interesting things, but, occasionally, I look around and see that I'm the only woman in the room full of 30 or 40 men and I do find it a bit odd. The cultural, historical connotations of engineering, particularly in Britain, seem to be quite different from other countries, certainly in the culture that I grew up in, which is South Asian. The connotation of an engineering career is something quite prestigious, and boys and girls are encouraged to do it, because it's seen as a stable, rewarding career, financially as well. So I find it a bit odd coming to Britain and seeing that people aren't as enthusiastic - it's not as prestigious or as respected a profession. And, not seeing enough women doing it - it breaks my heart. I think there's so many problems that need to be solved and the problems are quite diverse, so the solutions also need to be diverse. We need to be involving as many different members of society as possible, not just women but also different ethnicities and different socioeconomic classes and disabilities - it has to be a combined effort. Making parents and teachers aware that engineering is an interesting, rewarding, successful career choice for girls would go a long way towards increasing the intake of girls. But, at the same time, we have to do things to improve the environment for when they do become engineers. My earliest role model was my dad, who was a mechanical engineer. Growing up I didn't really have any other engineering role models but when I became a graduate student and started to feel more and more that I was a minority in terms of gender, I started to seek out role models. Now I know all of these amazing female engineers who are definitely huge role models to me, like Dame Ann Dowling, Professor Eleanor Stride at Oxford and Professor Alison Nobel at Oxford. I think they don't get as much visibility as they deserve. For young girls to look up to someone like Dame Ann Dowling and say, 'I want to be like her' - that would make such a huge difference. Gladys Ngetich grew up in Kenya, where she studied engineering. She came to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, and is now studying for her PhD. My father was an engineer in Kenya. During holidays he would come home with spanners and engineering tools trying to fix things here and there. I think I was introduced to that engineering environment when I was very young. I'm looking at improving or coming up with new efficient advanced cooling technologies for jet engines. We are filing a patent. That's actually one of my dreams. To work and to come up with something which is significant, that is going to have uses in the world in terms of making intercontinental travel safe and efficient so we use less fuel, we have less emissions, and just generally helping people all over the world. Aerospace is male-dominated. Personally, it's not been a big problem for me because I was born after four boys and so most of my childhood I spent with boys. I've had role models all through my levels of education - grammar school, high school, undergrad and now in Oxford. I think my biggest role model is my supervisor. He's helped me to write a paper and file a patent. I feel I have already achieved more than I was expecting. In five years, I'm not sure where I will be, but it will either be industry, maybe in Oxford, or I will be teaching.

1801\Science\A British satellite has gone into orbit on an Indian rocket to acquire full-colour, high-definition video of the surface of the Earth. The demonstrator is expected to pave the way for a series of at least 15 such spacecraft, which will be operated by the Guildford-based company Earth-i. The small, low-cost UK mission was one of 31 payloads riding on the Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. It lifted off from the Satish Dhawan spaceport in Andhra Pradesh. Controllers made first contact with the UK satellite as planned within a few hours. The spacecraft is a pre-production model. If it performs well over the coming months, its manufacturer, SSTL, also in Guildford, will proceed with Earth-i's first batch of five operational spacecraft. The contract for these platforms was signed in November. The forthcoming constellation - which will be known as Vivid-i - will be the first of its kind to provide hi-def, full-colour video. Short movies of the Earth's surface have been acquired from orbit before, but not on the envisaged scale. The demonstrator will circle the globe at an altitude of 505km. It has the ability to point and stare at a particular location. It can take a still picture or gather two-minute movie sequences. "We can collect up to 50 frames per second which is a lot of information," explained Earth-i CEO Richard Blain. "That allows us to stack the individual images and increase our effective resolution, achieving somewhere around 65cm to 75cm," he told BBC News. This is more than sharp enough to see moving objects like cars and ships. Image analysts could use such views to monitor and model traffic flow around cities, and in and out of ports. But the system can also be configured to generate slightly offset images of a target which can then be assembled into 3D models of surface elevation. This approach could be used to make urgent maps for relief teams entering an earthquake disaster zone, for example. However, the key capability being sought by Earth-i is frequent re-visits to locations. Detecting changes in near real-time is expected to be a burgeoning market for space data and this is only possible when you have a train of spacecraft constantly passing overhead. At the moment, Earth-i's plan is to put up additional batches of five spacecraft every year or so after the initial quintet have been launched at the end of 2019. With a 15-satellite constellation, Earth-i could image a particular place at least three times a day, cloud permitting. Networks of satellites are all the vogue at the moment. Indeed, on Friday's PSLV flight there were two other fascinating demonstrators that will trial technologies for future space constellations. One of these, the Phase 1 LEO satellite, was also manufactured by SSTL in Britain. It is a prototype for more than 100 follow-on platforms that Telesat of Canada wants to launch to deliver broadband across the globe. The other PSLV passenger of note in this context was a small radar-imaging satellite for Finnish start-up ICEYE. What all these proposed constellations have in common is that they are exploiting the use of cheap electronics normally found in consumer products - rather than the expensive, "space qualified" parts built into traditional spacecraft designs. This makes the manufacture and launch of multiple platforms much more affordable. "When you move to [commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components], you're suddenly a decade ahead. You get access to the very latest capabilities," ICEYE CEO and co-founder Rafal Modrzewski told BBC News. "And the change comes both in cost and in size because COTS components have been miniaturised to fit inside your phone, literally. We are using the same components." Friday's PSLV launch was the first since the rocket failed to jettison its nose cone on an ascent to orbit last August. The navigation satellite being carried on that occasion was lost because it could not get off the vehicle. The PSLV is India's workhorse rocket, so the country will be delighted to have it back in action. Its primary payload for the latest flight was another imaging and mapping spacecraft in the nation's long-running Cartosat series.

1802\Science\Chinese ships are racing to clean up a giant oil spill after an Iranian tanker sank in the East China Sea. The 120 sq km (46 sq mile) oil slick is thought to be made up of heavy fuel that was used to power the vessel. The Sanchi oil tanker sank on Sunday and officials say all its crew members are dead. It was carrying 136,000 tonnes of ultra-light crude oil from Iran which generates a toxic underwater slick that would be invisible from the surface. Both the fuel and the ultra-light oil could cause devastating damage to marine life. The Sanchi and a cargo ship collided 260km (160 miles) off Shanghai on 6 January, with the tanker then drifting south-east towards Japan. It caught fire after the collision and burnt for more than a week before sinking off China's east coast. Iranian officials now say all 32 crew members - 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis - on the tanker were killed. On Monday, China Central Television said a search and rescue operation had been cancelled and a clean-up operation had begun after a fire on the surface was extinguished. They said two ships were spraying the water with chemical agents designed to dissolve the oil. The BBC's China correspondent Robin Brant says the oil slick has more than doubled in size since Sunday. The big concern now is for the environmental impact, he said. There could also be a very tall plume of condensate, this ultra-refined form of oil, underneath the surface. Condensate, which creates products such as jet fuel, is very different from the black crude that is often seen in oil spills. It is toxic, low in density and considerably more explosive than regular crude. The cause of the collision is still not known. Some 13 vessels and an Iranian commando unit took part in the salvage operation, amid bad weather. On Saturday, salvage workers boarded the vessel and found the bodies of two crew members in a lifeboat. Only one other body had been found during the week of salvage operations. The rescue workers also retrieved the ship's black box but had to leave quickly because of the toxic smoke and high temperatures.\1.7069236040115356,0.5341233611106873,0.4785725474357605,0.9495283961296082,-0.32424232363700867,-0.2576131224632263,1.0760283470153809,-0.3632671535015106,-1.2412625551223755,-0.4705319404602051,0.43187546730041504,0.9091517329216003,0.7878557443618774,1.417231559753418,-0.6173000931739807,-0.0876639261841774,-0.3836892247200012,0.5865952372550964,0.1919555813074112,1.1580214500427246,0.3089632987976074,-0.16988612711429596,-0.1712840050458908,-0.45634979009628296,-0.5124192237854004,0.4032030701637268,0.4643290936946869,0.5229648947715759,-0.3914380371570587,0.3730772137641907,-0.848164439201355,-0.31704089045524597,-0.1560896337032318,0.36536669731140137,0.15626639127731323,-0.07379605621099472,0.44428279995918274,0.478319376707077,-0.5421940088272095,0.43303921818733215,-0.5791623592376709,-0.09380371123552322,0.56615149974823,0.09985683858394623,-0.7238466143608093,0.1189214289188385,-0.20151996612548828,-0.9915779232978821,-1.928402304649353,-1.494608759880066,0.6552056074142456,0.127243772149086,-0.28002500534057617,0.32742494344711304,0.18601563572883606,-0.6329703330993652,0.51382976770401,0.11688242852687836,-0.02422783337533474,1.0526353120803833,1.8550264835357666,-0.9769696593284607,0.2521442174911499,0.5513226985931396,0.37244918942451477,0.49180957674980164,0.8079876899719238,0.5015454888343811,-0.8351954817771912,-0.05867846682667732,-0.05361362546682358,-0.14079688489437103,0.25549057126045227,1.1876481771469116,-1.0097439289093018,0.03754890710115433,0.5223071575164795,0.16296358406543732,-0.7563245296478271,-0.5185948014259338,0.4999527335166931,-0.538821816444397,-0.22831185162067413,0.6149666905403137,0.70316481590271,-0.10707962512969971,0.7380337119102478,0.20661796629428864,0.3053639531135559,1.1599403619766235,-1.2624973058700562,-0.5275316834449768,0.220429465174675,-0.16288608312606812,0.3826903998851776,-0.3185512125492096,-0.012821700423955917,0.29128918051719666,-0.0749625712633133,0.9952072501182556\BBC\Huge oil spill left after burning tanker sinks off China\2018-01-15 13:40:22.0\
1803\Science\A discovery by citizen scientists has led to the confirmation of a system of five planets orbiting a far-off star. Furthermore, the planets' orbits are linked in a mathematical relationship called a resonance chain, with a pattern that is unique among the known planetary systems in our galaxy. Studying the system could help unlock some mysteries surrounding the formation of planetary systems. The results were announced at the 231st American Astronomical Society meeting. The system was found by astronomy enthusiasts using Zooniverse, an online platform for crowdsourcing research. "People anywhere can log on and learn what real signals from exoplanets look like, and then look through actual data collected from the Kepler telescope to vote on whether or not to classify a given signal as a transit, or just noise," said co-author Dr Jessie Christiansen, from Caltech in Pasadena. Since the discovery of four planets in this system was announced last year, Dr Christiansen has been working to shed further light on this distant planetary neighbourhood, dubbed K2-138. This led to the discovery of the fifth planet and hints of a sixth. All the worlds are a bit bigger than our own planet, ranging between 1.6 and 3.3 times the radius of Earth. The collected findings have now been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal. The raw data used in the discovery was provided by Nasa's Kepler space telescope, which identifies potential planets around other stars by looking for dips in the brightness of those stars when planets pass across their face - or transit them. Being in a resonance chain means each planet takes almost 50% longer to orbit the star than the next planet further in. Intriguingly, the sixth planet skips two slots in that resonance chain - taking much longer to orbit the star than it should if it was simply the next planet up from number five. "If you keep going with the resonance chain, you skip 19 days, you skip 27 days and you end up at about 43 days," said Dr Christiansen. "That's a really tantalising clue that we may be missing more planets in this system. If this chain continues, there's a gap." It's not the only system to exhibit resonances. The orbital motions of seven planets in the Trappist-1 system are linked in a complex chain. In the time that it takes for the innermost planet to make eight orbits, the second, third and fourth planets revolve five, three and two times around the star, respectively. But the way the chain is configured in K2-138 is different to Trappist-1 and unique among exoplanetary neighbourhoods. The near-resonant chain in Trappist-1 is thought to have formed as the planets migrated inwards toward their parent star after formation, early in the system's history. So K2-138 could yield further clues to the process by which planets form and then migrate from their original positions. This is a particularly contested area, with several competing ideas. "Some current theories suggest that planets form by a chaotic scattering of rock and gas and other material in the early stages of the planetary system's life. However, these theories are unlikely to result in such a closely packed, orderly system as K2-138," said Dr Christiansen. "What's exciting is that we found this unusual system with the help of the general public."

1804\Science\Scientists think they have the answer to a puzzle that baffled even Charles Darwin: How flowers evolved and spread to become the dominant plants on Earth. Flowering plants, or angiosperms, make up about 90% of all living plant species, including most food crops. In the distant past, they outpaced plants such as conifers and ferns, which predate them, but how they did this has has been a mystery. New research suggests it is down to genome size - and small is better. "It really comes down to a question of cell size and how you can build a small cell and still retain all the attributes that are necessary for life," says Kevin Simonin from San Francisco State University in California, US. Hundreds of millions of years ago, the Earth was dominated by ferns and conifers. Then, about 150 million years ago, the first flowering plants appeared on the scene. They quickly spread to all parts of the world, changing the landscape from muted green to a riot of vibrant colour. The reasons behind the incredible success and diversity of flowering plants have been debated for centuries. Charles Darwin himself called it an "abominable mystery", fearing this apparent sudden leap might challenge his theory of evolution. Simonin and co-researcher Adam Roddy, of Yale University, wondered if the size of the plant's genetic material - or genome - might be important. The biologists analysed data held by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, on the genome size of hundreds of plants, including flowering plants, gymnosperms (a group of plants, which include conifers and Ginkgo) and ferns. They then compared genome size with anatomical features such as the abundance of pores on leaves. This provides "strong evidence", they say, that the success and rapid spread of flowering plants around the world is down to "genome downsizing". By shrinking the size of the genome, which is contained within the nucleus of the cell, plants can build smaller cells. In turn, this allows greater carbon dioxide uptake and carbon gain from photosynthesis, the process by which plants use light energy to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Angiosperms can pack more veins and pores into their leaves, maximising their productivity. The researchers say genome-downsizing happened only in the angiosperms, and this was ''a necessary prerequisite for rapid growth rates among land plants''. "The flowering plants are the most important group of plants on Earth and now we finally know why they have been so successful," they say. The research published in the journal PLOS Biology raises more questions about plants. For instance, why were flowering plants able to shrink their genomes more than others? And why do ferns and conifers still exist, despite their large genomes and cells?

1805\Science\Astronomers have caught a massive black hole letting out a "double burp" after bingeing on hot gas. When cosmic gas comes near one of these sinkholes, it gets sucked in - but some of the energy is released back into space in the form of a burp. Now, the Hubble and Chandra space telescopes have detected a new belch emerging from a black hole located about 800 million light-years away. But they saw a remnant of another belch that occurred 100,000 years earlier. "Black holes are voracious eaters, but it turns out they don't have very good table manners," Julie Comerford, from the University of Colorado, Boulder, told the 231st American Astronomical Society meeting in Washington DC. "There are a lot of examples of black holes with single burps emanating out, but we discovered a galaxy with a supermassive black hole that has not one but two burps." The burp itself consists of a stream of high-energy particles that is kicked back from the black hole. Supermassive black holes are the largest type and are found at the centres of nearly all big galaxies. X-ray emission from the galaxy in question - called SDSS J1354+1327 - was picked up by the Chandra telescope, allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of its central black hole. Hubble was able to show them that a cloud of blue-green gas extending away from the black hole represented the aftermath of an earlier burp. They found that electrons had been stripped from atoms in the cone of gas and surmise that this was caused by a burst of radiation from the vicinity of the black hole. In the meantime, it had expanded 30,000 light-years away from the black hole itself. But the astronomers found a little loop in the images; the sign of a new belch emerging from the cosmic sinkhole. "This new burp is actually moving like a shockwave that is coming out very fast," said Dr Comerford. "I thought of an analogy for this and I was debating whether to use it or whether it's a little too gross... imagine someone eating dinner at their kitchen table and they're eating and burping, eating and burping. "You walk in the room and you notice there's an old burp still hanging in the air from the appetiser course. Meanwhile, they're eating the main course and they let out a new burp that's rocking the kitchen table." She said the black hole was going through a cycle of feasting, burping and napping, before starting over. The observations are important because they support previous theories - not demonstrated until now - that black holes should go through these cycles. The black holes were expected to become very bright in the process of feasting and burping and then go dark during the nap phase. "Theory predicted that black holes should flicker on and off very quickly and this galaxy's evidence of black holes does flicker on timescales of 100,000 years - which is long in human timescales, but in cosmological timescales is very fast," said Julie Comerford. The researchers think the black hole erupted twice because it consumed two separate meals. The reason for this might lie with the fact that the galaxy it's in had collided with another galaxy nearby. This would provide plenty of cosmic gas on which a black hole could feast. "There's a stream of stars and gas connecting these two galaxies. That collision led gas to stream towards the supermassive black hole and feed it two separate meals that led to these two separate burps," said the University of Colorado researcher. The results are published in the Astrophysical Journal.

1806\Science\A leading UK university has launched a close partnership with a top French research agency, in a relationship that could continue to provide UK academics with access to European research funding after Brexit. Imperial College London, one of the world's top science institutes, has created a joint maths laboratory in London with the biggest government research body in France, the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). It means that Imperial's researchers, or those from other UK institutions working at the Unite Mixte Internationale (UMI) Abraham de Moivre, will have the same funding status as those in France, even after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. "All members of the UMI, whatever their nationality, will have equal access to funding, resources and most importantly, opportunities for collaboration," said an Imperial spokesman. "This could include Imperial or other researchers seconded as members of the UMI Abraham de Moivre." This is the first time that the French government has co-funded such a research unit in the UK - and from the French perspective, this new centre in London will have the same status as a laboratory in France. The Anglo-French maths centre was planned before the referendum, but it will provide a model of co-operation and a shared approach to funding which will stretch beyond the UK's exit from the EU. UMI director Richard Craster, professor of applied mathematics at Imperial, said the project showed a commitment to "strengthening our ties with Europe by improving mobility and giving new opportunities for researchers to exchange ideas". Named after an 18th-Century French mathematician who worked in London, the laboratory has the aim of "bringing together some of the world's best mathematicians". The French ambassador said it would "provide a window to reach out to the UK mathematical community at large". Imperial College says work at the laboratory will advance knowledge in "number theory, mathematical analysis, biomathematics and financial mathematics". Imperial, ranked eighth in the QS World University Rankings, already has more than 200 French staff and almost 700 French students at its south Kensington base. President Prof Alice Gast said the new project "reinforces Imperial's exceptionally strong academic ties with France, as well as our determination to deepen collaborations with European partners". In the wake of the EU referendum result, she had promised to "vigorously defend our international values" and said that "political changes" would not restrict the college's research work. "Imperial is and will remain a European university," she had told staff and students. The UK's universities have been among the biggest net beneficiaries of EU research funding. But there have been concerns about the loss of access to whatever scheme follows the current Horizon 2020, which has provided 80bn euro (£71bn) in research funding. There have also been warnings from UK universities about their academics missing out on international projects commissioned through European research frameworks.

1807\Science\Edible insects are often portrayed as something of a sustainable superfood - an environmentally friendly alternative to livestock. But who is already eating them and do they actually taste any good? Two men cloaked in tarpaulin and tied to one another by a thick rope are engulfed in a swarm of hornets. They've been looking forward to this moment all day. One lifts the lid from a large jar of clear liquor and deftly swats the attacking hornets into its opening, while the other takes a pickaxe and hacks at a near-vertical hillside to expose the many layers of their nest. This moment, after two hours of trapping, baiting and chasing hornets through steep cedar forests in central Japan, brings the men a rush of satisfaction. Returning home later that day, the men have hundreds of hornets swimming in liquor - and a 7kg (1st 1lb) nest. Over bottles of beer, they pick the remaining hornets from the nest with tweezers, while their wives simmer the larvae - which taste like a gamey clotted cream when eaten raw, but like sweet mussels when cooked - with ginger, soy sauce, and mirin. They fry any semi-adult hornets until their exoskeletons are crispy coverings for the soft meat within. Neighbours drop by and toast their bounty with a glass of aged liquor made on a similar adventure, the hornet's venom having turned the ordinary white alcohol into a dark, smoky brew. As they enjoy the feast, they joke about how none of them will sleep much that night - hornets are considered a powerful aphrodisiac. The world is filled with scenes such as these, of families and friends collecting and cooking edible insects, not out of desperation but because they are there and they taste good. Take the famed worm sometimes found in mezcal: more than a tourist gimmick, the range of species lurking in the golden bottles are a cherished food in parts of Mexico. But if you want to find one, you must uproot and overturn a large, spike-riddled agave plant. Different agave species contain different worms. The red worms are especially prized: even raw they have a distinct smoky taste. They are in such demand that harvesting is strictly regulated, though visit a provincial Oaxacan market out of the official season and you may be approached with an offer of some illicit wriggling red worms. The vast majority of edible insects, however, are easy to harvest, with many of them quite literally falling from the sky. Take termites, which are eaten across sub-Saharan Africa. After the first rains, a flurry of the winged creatures rises like smoke from their mounds. The next day, they cover the ground in their thousands. Children are particularly keen collectors, since the process involves scrabbling around on all fours in the dirt before pulling the wings off each termite in turn They are then boiled and sauteed with a little salt. They are eaten mostly in rural areas, but can occasionally be found in urban markets, where they sell out quickly - and no wonder, for they taste like tiny pieces of crispy bacon. Other edible insects grow on trees, in vast quantities. Visit southern Burkina Faso in the rainy season, and you'll find the trees stripped of their leaves and the ground covered in shea caterpillars. Villagers wake as early as 02:00 to collect the juiciest specimens, which they cook into a stew for a hearty meal or fry as a snack. They've been described as tasting like meaty vegetables. Others grow inside trees, such as palm weevil larvae. These plump white grubs are popular in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where forest-dwellers take an axe to rotting palm trees to find the insects living inside. The larvae are wrapped in leaves and cooked in an open fire. They taste like small parcels of buttery pate. Many of the most widely eaten insects worldwide are grasshoppers, crickets and locusts. Why? Because we grow the plants that provide their preferred food in large concentrations. In Asia, farmers trail nets through fields of rice to catch grasshoppers. In Mexico, they sweep through fields of maize and alfalfa with large buckets for the very popular chapulines - the colloquial name for a pleasingly lemony species of grasshopper. Locusts are mentioned in the Old Testament because they were and still are a common edible crop pest in the Fertile Crescent region of the Middle East. Lighter than meat and heavier than seafood, they're delicious. Each one of these plant-loving insects absorbs the taste of your chosen seasoning and adds a satisfyingly crunchy texture. Like other crops, most edible insects are highly seasonal, with many celebrations of the coming harvest held around the world - including wasp festivals in Japan and caterpillar festivals in Burkina Faso and the Democratic Republic of Congo. So, while there's been a lot of recent interest in farming insects for food, we've been doing it non-intensively for millennia. The movement towards bringing edible insects to more dinner tables worldwide has been driven by the belief that eating insects could help boost nutrition and reduce pollution. There has been interest in the possibility that bugs - already eaten by two billion people - may have a lighter environmental footprint than livestock. Enthusiastic "ento-preneurs" - or bug businesses - are looking for new ways to appeal to the discerning consumer, with powdered insects now appearing in bread, pasta, and protein shakes. It could be that such powder-pushing is what introduces more consumers to the pleasures of bug eating. However, there remains a lot to be said for the joy and adventure that unapologetically insect-shaped delicacies can bring to the table.

1808\Science\A section of highway connecting Sydney and Melbourne started to melt. Bats fell dead from the trees, struck down by the heat. On the northern Great Barrier Reef, 99% of baby green sea turtles, a species whose sex is determined by temperature, were found to be female. In outer suburban Sydney, the heat hit 47.3C (117F) before a cool change knocked it down - to the relative cool of just 43.6C in a neighbouring suburb the following day. Scenes from a sci-fi novel depicting a scorched future? No, just the first days of 2018 in Australia, where summer is in fierce form. With parts of the US suffering through a particularly grim winter, extremes in both hemispheres have triggered discussions about the links between current events and the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The climate system is incredibly complex and no weather event can be directly attributed to rising emissions, but everything that is experienced today happens in a world that is about one degree warmer than the long-term mean. Prof Andy Pitman, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes at the University of New South Wales, says given the average temperature has risen it is a "no brainer" that the likelihood of the sort of heat that hit Sydney last week has also increased. "It was a meteorological anomaly, but the probability works a bit like if you stand at sea level and throw a ball in the air, and then gradually make your way up a mountain and throw the ball in the air again," he says. "The chances of the ball going higher increases dramatically. That's what we're doing with temperature." While it is record-breaking that tends to make news, scientists say it is the unbroken run of hot days in the high 30s and 40s that causes the significant problems for human health, and other life. Health officials in Victoria highlighted the threat of heatwaves when they found about 374 more people died during an extreme three-day period in January 2009 than would have been expected had it been cooler. There has, however, been relatively little investment in research into the health impact of escalating maximum temperatures. A paper published in the journal Nature Climate Change last year said while a government report called for greater focus on the area 25 years ago, less than 0.1% of health funding since has been dedicated to the impact of climate change. Prof Pitman says Australia is yet to properly consider the health risks of a warming planet. "It's not being able to cool down at night, and in the days that follow, that causes problems," he says. "I was camping in the Blue Mountains [west of Sydney] on Saturday night. It was about 30 degrees at midnight, and I could feel my heart racing. Now, that extra stress on my cardiovascular system didn't kill me, but it might have if I was 20 years older." Last year was Australia's third-warmest year since records began, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Globally, it was the second or third warmest, and comfortably the hottest year in which there was not an El Niño weather system helping push up temperatures further. Put another way: it is now hotter without an El Niño than it was with an El Niño just a few years ago. In eastern Australia - where the bulk of the population lives - temperatures were particularly inflated during summer months, when an increase is most likely to lead to uncomfortable or dangerous heat. Several locations had runs of record hot days and nights. More than 40% of the most populous state, New South Wales, recorded at least 50 days hotter than 35C. The town of Moree had 54 consecutive days of extreme heat. "Across Australia, the last five years were all in the top seven years on record. That's quite a striking signal," the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's Dr Blair Trewin says. The extra energy warming up the climate system is also being felt in several ways. The bushfires season starts earlier than it used to, and Australia has already experienced wild blazes this season. Along with the increased background heat, this is in part due to a clear drying pattern in some areas. Rainfall is down for both the south-east and south-west of the country in the cooler months months between April and October. "That also has quite significant impacts for agriculture because historically that's when they get most of their inflows," Dr Trewin says. The impact of warming on the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef, the only living structure visible from space, has been well documented. Estimates suggest about half its shallow-water coral was killed during bleaching events over the past two years linked to increased water temperatures. Further south, the sea along Tasmania's east coast has warmed dramatically, pushing tropical species to unlikely high latitudes and coinciding with the disappearance of giant kelp forests. Some weather patterns have not changed. There is no evidence of variations in cyclone behaviour or the frequency or intensity of large hail and lightning, for instance. All this comes against a backdrop of political fighting over how to tackle climate change. It is less than a year since senior government members brandished a piece of coal in parliament to taunt the Labor opposition, whom ministers accused of wanting to see an end to the fossil fuel industry. The Malcolm Turnbull-led government remains committed to a 2030 target pledged at the Paris climate talks: a 26-to-28% cut below 2005 emissions. It says it can cut emissions while shielding the public and business from unnecessary price rises. It also points out that Australia is directly responsible for little more than 1% of global emissions (though it is responsible for about 30% of the global coal trade). But national greenhouse accounts released in the week before Christmas showed Australia's industrial emissions have been on an upward curve since 2014, when the government repealed carbon pricing laws, which required big business to pay for its pollution. Emissions had fallen in the two years the laws were in place. The latest projections in the accounts suggest Australia will overshoot its 2030 target unless new policies are introduced to arrest the growth. "There really isn't an argument that climate change isn't true in parliament anymore," Prof Pitman says. "You'd find a couple of members of parliament that say that, but you'd also find a couple who didn't believe in evolution and didn't believe in inoculating children against disease. "The issue now is that the scale of concern - and the action under way or committed to both in Australia and internationally - doesn't match the scale of the problem."\2.242924451828003,-0.9099452495574951,-1.1206761598587036,-0.4543198049068451,-1.0897507667541504,0.3558274805545807,1.5979454517364502,-0.48543521761894226,-0.15390373766422272,0.22824212908744812,1.1012632846832275,1.4990490674972534,0.3507467806339264,1.5059564113616943,-1.0707541704177856,-0.7700384259223938,0.713321328163147,0.47497740387916565,0.46007397770881653,1.169614553451538,-0.44785940647125244,0.8210634589195251,-1.7070600986480713,-0.39051517844200134,0.25975361466407776,0.652382493019104,-0.07200545817613602,0.07777413725852966,0.22905470430850983,-0.0464404933154583,-0.2837793529033661,1.7422599792480469,-0.05861122906208038,1.1421561241149902,-0.24589955806732178,-1.7597886323928833,1.014600157737732,-0.3147377371788025,0.182619109749794,1.1436598300933838,0.22255085408687592,-2.24416184425354,0.9501376748085022,0.1523289531469345,0.5382581353187561,0.5068423748016357,1.6142616271972656,-0.1846488118171692,0.11633944511413574,0.34317514300346375,0.191842183470726,0.2193431258201599,0.4780746400356293,0.67823725938797,-0.6642723679542542,-0.5694342851638794,1.9804661273956299,0.02544989623129368,-0.890140950679779,1.132096290588379,-0.19537921249866486,0.2813241183757782,0.5466461181640625,0.5195173025131226,-1.2084192037582397,-1.33146333694458,0.07042214274406433,0.8579826354980469,0.3761356770992279,-0.45694872736930847,1.1204919815063477,-0.14095059037208557,-1.2351043224334717,0.6255825161933899,0.3314081132411957,-0.4768085181713104,0.36864417791366577,-0.3887883424758911,-1.9667662382125854,-1.2424280643463135,-0.19816233217716217,-0.5002242922782898,-0.34563371539115906,1.497001051902771,0.14424316585063934,-1.7734766006469727,0.5430715680122375,0.3612917363643646,-0.15803173184394836,-0.3205152153968811,-1.1919293403625488,0.4151237905025482,0.7029328346252441,0.20412121713161469,-0.6345728635787964,1.0159082412719727,0.853736400604248,-1.5681232213974,-1.0927050113677979,1.095624327659607\BBC\Hot topic\2018-01-13 17:28:15.0\
1809\Science\Marylebone Road and Hyde Park Corner, both in central London, have the most polluted postcodes in Britain, says a new study on air quality. The data comes from a project to map concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) across the country. However, the results also show that large parts of Britain have relatively clean air. Diesel vehicles are a key source of NO2 gas, which has been linked to respiratory disease. You can see what air quality is like in your area by entering your postcode in the search below. The data represents an average for 2016 and does not include Northern Ireland. If you cannot view the postcode search, please click here to reload the page. Although dirty air doesn't kill people directly, it's estimated to contribute to shortening the lives of 40,000 people a year in the UK. Pollution is thought to undermine the health of people with heart or lung problems. A new analysis by the company EarthSense shows NO2 concentrations in 100x100m squares across the UK. The company's technical director, Prof Roland Leigh, says it is the most detailed model yet for assessing air quality in Britain. "By focussing it down we can really isolate the hotspots of poor air quality, and better target our solutions." Prof Leigh says it's important to be aware of bad pollution levels where you live, or near schools or your route to work, but that no areas in Britain are bad enough that people should avoid exercising outside. "Air quality is actually getting better in Britain, and we are in a better state than a large number of countries - particularly across Asia. "In Britain, it's always better to be outside exercising than inside avoiding pollution, even in the worst areas." In the study, each area is rated on a scale from 1, least polluted, to 6, most polluted. More than four in five postcodes in Great Britain fall into the least polluted category (1). The scale is worked out based on a probability that each area will break the annual legal limit for NO2. Areas fall foul if they average more than 40 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre. Fewer than 1% of postcodes are rated either 4 or 5, and no postcodes in Great Britain fall into the highest category - six - for areas that average over 100 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre. Three-quarters of the postcodes with the worst ratings are in London. Those outside the capital include other built-up areas as well as otherwise rural locations near motorways. The company has largely based its analysis on traffic emissions, the dominant source of NO2 in the UK. In many big cities, such as London, safe limits on harmful particulates and nitrogen oxides, including NO2, are regularly breached. In the last few years, the campaign group ClientEarth has won a number of rulings against the UK government over air pollution. These legal challenges forced ministers to draw up plans to tackle the problem and meet EU targets on NO2. However, a recent study in the journal Nature Geoscience suggested that targets for reducing NO2 pollution could be achieved more quickly than the government expects. This was because government projections did not take into account that as cars age, they produce less of the harmful gas.

1810\Science\Conservatism and conservation are "natural allies", Prime Minster Theresa May has said, praising her party's "proud heritage" of protecting the environment. She pointed to the 1956 Clean Air Act to tackle smog in London and Margaret Thatcher's early warnings about the dangers of global warming. But more recently, have the Tories been blowing hot and cold about the green agenda? David Cameron championed the environment as a key issue for his party when he took over as leader in 2005. "Vote Blue, go Green" he urged voters the following year in local elections, promising a "green revolution" under the Tories, who were to get a new logo in the form of a scribbled tree. Mr Cameron memorably went to the Arctic to see first-hand the effects of climate change and to be pictured on a dog-driven sled. "Hug a husky" - as the episode came to be known - became one of the defining images representing his attempts to modernise and rebrand the Conservative Party to broaden its appeal. The Conservatives went into the 2010 election promising to be the greenest government in history. There were pledges to reduce emissions, to promote low carbon technology, to conserve natural habitats and an offer of a so-called Green Deal to improve energy efficiency in homes. But once in power, in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, critics say, David Cameron's enthusiasm for the green agenda began to wane, and some questioned his genuine commitment to the cause. The government was preoccupied with reducing the deficit and putting the brakes on public spending, and the Lib Dems took charge of the flagship announcement of the introduction of a 5p tax on plastic bags. There was also a planned sell-off of state-owned woodland in England. In 2013, it was reported that David Cameron had told Downing Street aides to "get rid of all the green crap" - referring to environmental levies on energy bills. And he backed fracking, to the dismay of green campaigners. After the 2015 election yielded a Conservative majority, the Green Deal for home insulation was scrapped and subsidies for on-shore wind farms came to an end a year earlier than initially planned. Now, Theresa May has decided that championing the environment should, once again, be one of the central themes of a Conservative government. She's promised that there will be no watering down of EU environment regulations after Brexit - and put forward a series of measures to try to rein in the use of disposable plastics. Mrs May has one of her "big beasts", Michael Gove, in charge of policy. After an unexpected return to the cabinet last summer - he's clearly making the most of an opportunity, launching a number of high-profile initiatives with savvy social media campaigns, such as a ban on ivory sales. The prime minister hopes the strategy will help her win over young voters who deserted the Conservatives at the election. But Green activists have already criticised her plans as being too vague. And Mrs May's former communications director Katy Perrior has said the 25-year environment plan launched on Thursday was originally intended to be "as boring as possible," and while the prime minister's enthusiasm for protecting the environment "may not be insincere", it is "certainly new". Cynics will accuse the government of sensing the environment could be a vote-winner and throwing its weight behind the green agenda. But, speaking at the launch, Theresa May said care for the natural world was at the core of her party's philosophy. "Making good on the promise that each new generation should be able to build a better future is a fundamental Conservative principle," she said.\0.22136487066745758,0.10157544910907745,-0.43081405758857727,-1.0342226028442383,0.909592866897583,-0.11070723086595535,1.5963249206542969,-0.3299320340156555,-1.3468745946884155,-0.7006217837333679,0.32367876172065735,0.4096237123012543,0.7241414785385132,2.202138662338257,-0.7213134765625,0.20530888438224792,-0.19052447378635406,0.046903807669878006,-0.15681904554367065,-0.5488630533218384,0.3506618142127991,-0.9177997708320618,-0.4364480674266815,0.5796374678611755,-1.3836194276809692,1.5203453302383423,0.4768713116645813,0.41059476137161255,-0.008067945018410683,-0.20035535097122192,-1.0862908363342285,0.3839088976383209,-0.5384455323219299,0.1376999020576477,0.009318439289927483,-0.3233621418476105,-1.0324552059173584,0.34688621759414673,0.4626114070415497,-1.2419681549072266,-1.245792269706726,-0.9217071533203125,1.2883201837539673,-0.1299751251935959,0.4495270550251007,0.17512966692447662,0.34523850679397583,0.9142411351203918,-0.3164568543434143,-0.2576582431793213,0.5027993321418762,-1.072933554649353,-0.19546356797218323,-0.04998600855469704,0.8274379968643188,0.3017858564853668,-0.24404115974903107,-0.7864208221435547,0.6377548575401306,-0.04717666655778885,-0.43613067269325256,-0.36689063906669617,0.859677791595459,0.42870211601257324,-0.8652068972587585,0.3428855836391449,-0.10833640396595001,0.5558885335922241,0.12629899382591248,0.05296790227293968,0.5288463234901428,-0.13454025983810425,-0.43661972880363464,0.11880195140838623,-0.6845316886901855,-0.4019995629787445,1.1454046964645386,0.9718360900878906,-0.7840566635131836,-1.0943870544433594,0.916110098361969,-0.6084846258163452,-0.7653929591178894,0.4394725263118744,0.5264019966125488,0.35896649956703186,0.3190520405769348,0.6318260431289673,0.49823087453842163,-0.25791531801223755,0.1688670516014099,0.31890934705734253,0.13391387462615967,1.1348505020141602,-0.6812594532966614,0.014715989120304585,-0.022210724651813507,-1.596549391746521,-0.5749517679214478,-1.0214459896087646\BBC\How green are the Tories?\2018-01-11 19:15:04.0\
1811\Science\Cape Town, home to Table Mountain, African penguins, sunshine and sea, is a world-renowned tourist destination. But it could also become famous for being the first major city in the world to run out of water. Most recent projections suggest that its water could run out as early as March. The crisis has been caused by three years of very low rainfall, coupled with increasing consumption by a growing population. The local government is racing to address the situation, with desalination plants to make sea water drinkable, groundwater collection projects, and water recycling programmes. Meanwhile Cape Town's four million residents are being urged to conserve water and use no more than 87 litres (19 gallons) a day. Car washing and filling up swimming pools has been banned. And the visiting Indian cricket team were told to limit their post-match showers to two minutes. Such water-related problems are not confined to Cape Town, of course. Nearly 850 million people globally lack access to safe drinking water, says the World Health Organization, and droughts are increasing. So it seems incredible that we still waste so much of this essential natural resource. In developing and emerging countries, up to 80% of water is lost through leakages, according to German environmental consultancy GIZ. Even in some areas of the US, up to 50% of water trickles away due to ageing infrastructure. A growing number of technology companies are focusing their work on water management - applying "smart" solutions to water challenges. For example, French company CityTaps is on a mission to streamline water access in urban homes with its smart water meters linked to an internet-based management system. The company is first targeting poor homes in urban areas and its system, CTSuite, is currently being trialled in Niger. Users buy "water credits" via their mobile phones and a smart meter dispenses only as much water as has been paid for. Users receive alerts when their credit balance gets low, and if they don't top up the account, the meter automatically switches off the flow. The utility can track water usage remotely in near real-time via the internet. A sudden spike in water outflow and a change in pressure, measured by "internet of things" sensors, can then help identify leaks across the network. Water companies are also using drones and satellites to help spot leaks, and in some circumstances even divining rods - despite scientific doubts, some firms say they do work. "The internet of things offers new avenues for technological innovation in the water field, mostly by providing real-time data that - we hope - can be used to help utilities become ever more efficient and high-performing," says Gregoire Landel, chief executive of CityTaps. Better water management also helps save on the electricity and chemicals required to produce drinkable water. Meanwhile, other companies are using technology to harvest water from new sources. US-based WaterSeer, for example, is developing a device capable of collecting water from the air. An internal fan draws air into an underground collection chamber where the vapour condenses, making use of the earth's cooler temperatures. Solar or electricity grid-powered coolers also help the condensation process. The company says water can be produced with "less than a 100 watts" of electricity - the power requirement of an old-fashioned light bulb. "Individuals and businesses will pave the way for innovative solutions, as they will be able to move and adopt a series of them quicker than large utilities that are sometimes mired in regulatory constraints and rigid decision-making cultures," says Nancy Curtis, a founding partner of WaterSeer. "However, utilities offer the opportunity to make large-scale impacts on replenishing depleting water supplies." A number of water-restricted municipalities in the US are exploring how WaterSeer devices could be used to improve water security, the company says. But the device is still being tested in the field, so these are early days. "A community of 500 would save 40 million US gallons (150m litres; 33m gallons) of water or more each year, reducing stress on traditional surface and underground sources," argues Ms Curtis. Technology may have its place in helping us use water more efficiently, but it is unlikely to have much impact on those without any access to water in the first place, says Alexandros Makarigakis of Unesco's international hydrological programme (IHP). "Smart water systems cannot be expected to have much impact regarding provision of access for the unconnected. [They] are more effective in the urban context," he says. This is echoed by Vincent Casey, senior manager at the charity WaterAid. "The technology to connect people to a water supply has been around since ancient Egypt. It's not a technical problem," he says. More important is how water supplies are organised, he argues, which is an issue primarily for governments, with support from the private sector. "The priority is mobilising resources and paying sufficient attention to the management arrangement to keep people connected," says Mr Casey. That's not to say WaterAid eschews tech completely. It has successfully used mobile app mWater to monitor water access and existing networks. For those with no direct-to-home supply, services like Grundfos' "water ATM", which enables people to access water from a local dispenser using a pre-paid card, are also proving useful. But there is a sense that much of this technology is merely tinkering at the edges. The overarching issue is the potentially devastating effect of global warming on water availability and how we, collectively, endeavour to tackle it.\0.793441891670227,-0.1610957533121109,-1.904606580734253,-0.14902134239673615,-0.11278087645769119,-0.9017609357833862,1.8931560516357422,-1.0623782873153687,-0.9263826012611389,1.2107949256896973,0.0649554431438446,1.1067198514938354,0.782051682472229,0.4474943280220032,0.09768223017454147,-0.8885378837585449,-0.15774720907211304,1.0145928859710693,-0.6518993973731995,0.005571759305894375,0.25400441884994507,-0.35719019174575806,0.6720820069313049,-1.0694078207015991,0.5810883641242981,0.9639273881912231,-0.09632778912782669,0.012890920974314213,1.1250962018966675,0.7033126354217529,-0.8697385787963867,1.0447909832000732,0.7156792879104614,-0.9424781799316406,-0.06576883792877197,-1.836119294166565,-0.017345590516924858,0.29676300287246704,0.9374450445175171,0.9001341462135315,-0.5544019341468811,-0.09373607486486435,0.9001739025115967,-0.3567368984222412,-0.45468297600746155,-1.3393445014953613,1.2924234867095947,0.11184293031692505,-0.5342965126037598,-0.37948721647262573,0.16323526203632355,0.7460870742797852,0.29501938819885254,-0.07642994076013565,0.9848496317863464,-0.5341855883598328,0.9465113878250122,0.5162450075149536,-0.5259178280830383,1.191606879234314,-0.4709028899669647,-1.479989767074585,0.5232712626457214,0.08456464856863022,-0.2718927562236786,-1.0139083862304688,-0.7723616361618042,1.3155168294906616,-0.2703278064727783,1.2790930271148682,0.2698206901550293,1.101348638534546,-0.16917411983013153,0.020433900877833366,-0.9821290969848633,-0.3727805018424988,-1.310689091682434,-0.12739643454551697,-1.1424429416656494,-2.6387674808502197,0.11602296680212021,-0.5228405594825745,-0.7521495819091797,1.1097297668457031,-0.5046412944793701,-0.4459311068058014,0.7224099040031433,-0.20753636956214905,0.8347351551055908,-0.5205990672111511,-2.158669948577881,1.323714017868042,1.1988935470581055,0.813507080078125,-0.6520519256591797,0.41679009795188904,1.2387762069702148,-1.0784913301467896,-1.0437743663787842,0.9487840533256531\BBC\Thirsty city\2018-01-12 01:04:32.0\
1812\Science\"Lobster is one of those rare foods that you cook from a live state," the recipe says. "Quickly plunge lobsters head-first into the boiling water... Boil for 15 minutes," the recipe then instructs. It's the tried-and-trusted method for many of us with any experience of cooking lobster - and there are dozens of similar recipes online. But on Wednesday Switzerland banned the practice and ordered that lobsters be stunned before being despatched to our plates to avoid unnecessary suffering in the kitchen. It comes amid growing scientific evidence that lobsters - and other invertebrates, such as crayfish and crabs - are able to feel pain. So what's wrong with the traditional method? And what are the alternatives? Animal welfare scientists define pain as "an aversive sensation and feeling associated with actual or potential tissue damage", explains Jonathan Birch, assistant professor in philosophy at the London School of Economics. Defined like this, experiments suggest crustaceans do feel pain, Dr Birch explains in his article "Crabs and lobsters deserve protection from being cooked alive". In a series of experiments at Queen's University in Belfast, crabs gave up a valuable dark hiding place after repeatedly receiving an electric shock there. "They were willing to give up their hideaway in order to avoid the source of their probable pain," said Prof Robert Elwood, who led the team carrying out the experiments. He told the BBC that numerous experiments showed "rapid avoidance learning, and [crustaceans] giving up highly valuable resources to avoid certain noxious stimuli" - consistent with the idea of pain. Crustaceans don't necessarily exhibit signs of pain that are easily recognisable to humans, say welfare activists. Stress-induced behaviours include thrashing, trying to escape and autotomy - where body parts are shed by the animal in response to damage or capture. This might explain why they are excluded from many countries' legislation on animal welfare - though decapod crustaceans are protected in countries like Norway, New Zealand and Switzerland, and there are campaigns for change elsewhere. Humanely, say activists - whereby they are killed immediately or put into a state of continuous unconsciousness until death occurs. But neither stunning nor killing crustaceans is necessarily a simple business when compared, for example, to fish. This is because crustaceans have decentralised nervous systems, meaning that unlike fish, they can't be rendered unconscious with a single blow to the head. To "spike" a lobster to death, again unlike fish, you have to pierce the body in more than one spot. So the best ways to achieve a quick death are, according to animal welfare charity RSPCA Australia: More details from RSPCA Australia For Prof Elwood, the major concern is not the domestic cook or even restaurant kitchens, but major food processing plants, where animals are commonly dismembered without being killed. He also says labelling crustaceans with relevant welfare information could help consumers make informed choices.\1.2302038669586182,0.7970747947692871,-0.9870792031288147,-0.5836825966835022,-0.7606579065322876,1.0261900424957275,0.8368399143218994,-0.5961819291114807,-0.8365376591682434,0.3633996248245239,-0.4281649589538574,0.6780900955200195,-0.30289003252983093,0.3265680968761444,-0.2887861132621765,0.4405321776866913,-0.5741174221038818,0.4628991186618805,-0.1054258793592453,-0.7236030101776123,0.24218764901161194,-0.04669935256242752,0.4729619324207306,0.13536925613880157,-0.2734316885471344,0.3074503242969513,0.32526490092277527,-0.18204265832901,0.5681620240211487,-0.2798722982406616,0.2166377305984497,0.1102079302072525,0.6719573140144348,-0.36802294850349426,-0.5768824219703674,-0.34514129161834717,-0.43300706148147583,-0.3695186376571655,-0.4312816560268402,-0.01332551147788763,-0.4586903154850006,-0.9553382992744446,0.8723211288452148,0.9656829237937927,-0.6907694339752197,0.17364045977592468,0.8448279500007629,-0.3281306326389313,-1.2095072269439697,0.2004239559173584,0.8481936454772949,0.4721868336200714,-0.6083434820175171,0.6003848314285278,0.8847529888153076,-1.1632798910140991,0.16726356744766235,-0.4386237859725952,-1.044745683670044,0.6887577772140503,0.09053972363471985,-0.30023232102394104,-0.055932752788066864,-0.3164480924606323,-0.6625106930732727,-0.33047759532928467,0.5944550037384033,1.2325986623764038,-0.43482157588005066,0.37976622581481934,1.537948727607727,-0.0636327788233757,-0.7579054236412048,1.0094841718673706,-0.6136705279350281,0.09772872179746628,-0.12831194698810577,1.4954785108566284,-0.8671889901161194,-0.9321122765541077,0.009503171779215336,0.00788640696555376,-1.1586863994598389,1.309073567390442,0.0671495795249939,-0.320485383272171,0.34115156531333923,0.5785264372825623,-0.0433289110660553,0.4886135756969452,-0.7906471490859985,0.023084986954927444,0.41247549653053284,0.8217256665229797,-0.01489433366805315,0.5998529195785522,0.6981255412101746,-1.8987101316452026,-0.974242627620697,1.0754836797714233\BBC\Kitchen welfare\2018-01-11 13:53:25.0\
1813\Science\Kiliii Yuyan is an indigenous Nanai photographer who documents native cultures and wilderness conservation issues. He spent time with the Inupiat, an indigenous community from North Slope Alaska, whose lifestyle and culture is dependent on subsistence harvest of marine mammals. Members of the community are allowed to catch limited number of bowhead whales a year from stable populations. The first boats to harpoon the whale receive shares. The lead whaling crew divide the head between them. Above, Flora Aiken gives a blessing to the first bowhead whale of the spring season. The Inupiat have a rich spiritual life that centres around the gift of the whale to the community. This camp, erected miles out on the sea ice, is an Inupiat home away from home during hunting season. Six-year-old Steven Reich examines his father's umiaq, or skin boat used for whaling. His father Tad, captain of Yugu crew, expresses excitement about taking Steven out whaling on the ice for the first time. "I am proud of my son - he's here to learn to be a hunter," he says. The cure for feeling cold while out on the ice is to eat quok, the Inupiat word for frozen raw meat and fish. Seal is also a source of food for the Inupiaq. Misigaq, or seal oil, is a liquid made from the blubber of the bearded seal. It is left to ferment for a few days at refrigerator temperatures before eating. Sigvaun Kaleak and his father, Raleigh, are lifelong whalers. Although commercial whaling has taken a massive toll on the global whale population, the Inupiat have maintained a sustainable harvest. Bernadette Adams was the first Inupiat woman to harpoon a whale. "I happen to have no brothers, so I had to find some way to help the family out," says Bernadette. Inupiat elder Foster Simmonds has been a whaler since he was a child. Beluga whales are seen trapped by sea ice as shifting winds create unstable conditions. Though some villages hunt belugas, the Inupiat that hunt bowhead whales prefer to watch the white whales as they pass by during their migration. Today's Inupiat leaders live double lives, treading the line between modern concerns for the community and the subsistence lifestyle. Maasak Leavitt, who works for the North Slope Borough, was hurt when his son pronounced on Facebook that his father was "too busy politicking" to hunt. Maasak hopes that one day his son will understand his work in government helps to protect traditional practices. At Nalukataq, the summer whaling festival, the village comes out to celebrate a successful whaling season and to give thanks to the whale for its gift. Here, successful crewmembers do the blanket toss. They are thrown up to 30ft (9m) in the air, and depend on everyone's help to land safely.

1814\Science\Prince Harry is the new president of a conservation group called African Parks, which takes over national parks and gives rangers military-style training to take on poachers and protect wildlife. The BBC visited one of the parks it manages, at Zakouma in Chad. A distant, guttural growl of elephants, and the occasional trumpet, drifted over the thick screen of lush trees and dry-scrub grass. The nearest calls were nearby, the furthest a mile or more away: this was the large herd we had been looking for. Tracking collars had pinpointed them at dawn, but these elephants move quickly, and after centuries of hunting, run if they see, or even smell, humans. The well armed rangers from the Mamba Two fast-response team fanned out ahead to the left and the right, not wanting to surprise, or be surprised by, a lone animal. They excitedly beckoned us to follow them slowly and carefully into a thicker section of trees. It had been a three-hour flight in a small plane, from Chad's capital, N'Djamena, to Zakouma National Park, and a three-hour drive to this section in search of the herd, the last of the park's elephants. Tens of thousands once lived in this reserve covering 3,800 sq km (1,470 sq miles), but for centuries it was the nearest place Sudanese horsemen could find ivory, much coveted by Arab traders along the Nile. Originally they hunted with spears and swords, but modern AK47 assault rifles allowed killing on an industrial scale. Janjaweed mercenaries from Dafur, in western Sudan, continue to be the biggest poaching threat, with heavily armed, military-trained raiding parties on horseback targeting the elephant herds for their tusks. Zakouma has lost 90% of the 22,000 elephants it had in the mid-1970s. War with Libya and the upsurge in demand for ivory reduced the population to 4,300 by the early 2000s, and the chaos of civil war cut that to less than 500 by 2010. Rangers were being killed, animals massacred in large groups, and it looked as if Zakouma's elephants were heading towards extinction. But in the past few years, an amazing transformation has taken place. In less than a decade a private, non-profit organisation has turned its fortunes around. African Parks manages some of the toughest to protect parks on the continent, and in Zakouma, at least, it has made incredible progress. "We have rangers, and due to the threat that they face, they are military trained," says Zakouma park manager Leon Lamprecht. "But they are ultimately doing law enforcement and not military operations. We are trying to stop poachers before they kill the assets that we protect." African Parks calls what it does "delegated management in partnership with governments and local communities". It manages 13 protected areas in nine countries at the invitation of governments that lack the staff or resources required to protect their own wildlife. Zakouma hasn't lost an elephant in 18 months, or a ranger in five years, but it was an uphill struggle. In 2012, a patrol of seven rangers discovered a poachers' camp in the park, and waited overnight for them to return. But as they carried out their morning prayers at first light, the poachers attacked them. So African Parks introduced strict military-style training and tactics - to make sure rangers weren't caught unawares at the most vulnerable times of day - at dawn and at dusk. "I think the term 'militarisation' of conservation isn't the greatest term. A better term is the 'professionalisation' of conservation," says the chief executive of African Parks, Peter Fearnhead. Poachers, he says, are often highly militarised themselves, are highly trained, have equipment that is very freely available and don't abide by any of the laws and regulations of countries. "So in order to make sure the execution of the law enforcement function is done professionally, you have got to have very, very professionally trained people," he says. Adoum Allam is the sniper with Mamba Two patrol. He's 30, carries a long gun with a sight, and is doing the job his father did before he was killed by poachers, when Adoum was just eight. He went through two weeks of selection, eight weeks of basic training and another four weeks learning to shoot. "It's a very dangerous job, but I love doing it," he says. It brings in money to support wife and four children, but he admits it is risky. Around his waist he wears six leather belt-like straps adorned with solid, square, leather amulets each containing a verse from the Koran. All the rangers wear these "waragars" to protect them from bullets. Those worn by the Adoum Allam's colleague who mans the high-calibre weapon mounted on their vehicle are bigger and more numerous. Chad isn't the first place that comes to mind when well-off Westerners plan a safari to see some African wildlife. Those who've heard of this country that straddles the Sahara and central Africa, are more likely to think Boko Haram than luxury camp. Lake Chad, on the country's western borders with Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger, has been blighted by the Islamist group. But on this eastern side of Chad, high-end tourists are paying thousands of dollars a night to glamp out under canvas, watch the birds and the wildlife, and experience something exciting, different and adventurous. "A typical park will cost African Parks anywhere between one and about $5m [£3.75m] per year just to keep going," says Peter Fearnhead. "In order to be able to look after these parks, the resources needed - the costs of running parks and running them properly - are very, very high." They are almost entirely donor-funded, with the European Union providing a huge chunk of the money. Attracting top-dollar tourists is the ultimate aim across all the places African Parks manages - so they can start paying for themselves. But those most at risk are often blighted by war, or instability. Even the Nomade wilderness camp at Zakouma - run during the four dry-season months of the year and booked up two years in advance - still pays only a third of its bills. The EU and philanthropists don't just give money to protect the animals, but because of the stability and the wider development a successfully run park can bring. Winning over the local community is the key to protecting it from poachers. Schools have been built, and jobs provided. Now, a network of radios has been given to villages outside the park to provide an early warning system for the rangers. "When you have people coming out of Sudan - the same people that have committed the atrocities in a place like Darfur - when they come to poachin Zakouma, they're not coming along with their American Express and paying for accommodation and food along the way," says Mr Fearnhead. "They rape, they pillage, they plunder and at the end of it they poach as well. "We provide security to people living around the park. "We have a common enemy, and by aligning ourselves with the local people, we are able to overcome those forces." It's going so well that next year African Parks will be moving six black rhinos to Zakouma from South Africa, where poaching is destroying herds. The government of Chad is also happy with the arrangement. "The number of animals is increasing and that's why we decided to sign a new agreement - it's a win-win result and we are very happy with it," says Ahmat Mbodou Mahamat, Chad's environment minister. African Parks has been asked to dramatically expand the area it manages at Zakouma and take over another park in Chad's north-eastern desert, where a rare species of crocodile is greatly endangered. "We must understand that the biodiversity is not being preserved just because we want to look at the animals. An equilibrium of the ecosystem also provides a better life for humans," the minister adds. In the thick forest in southern Zakouma, the guards from Mamba Two patrol whispered for us to hang back and wait, as we were close to the herd. It was 11:00, with the Sun high and the temperature rising, and we were worried the elephants would be under the shade of the trees, scattered and out of view in the forest. But unexpectedly the landscape opened up into a wide green swathe of swampy grassland between strips of forest, and there they were - hundreds of them. Zakouma is home to one of the biggest single herds of elephants you can find anywhere in Africa. Some tore at the lush grass with their trunks and slapped at the water, others were sliding their huge frames into the mud and rolling on to their backs. The calves were having even more fun - one was perhaps just a month old. In 2013 there was only one elephant under the age of three in Zakouma, but now there are 85. With the wind at our faces and the animals unaware we were there, it was a magical experience. Six years after the park came under new management, the amount of wildlife has tripled, the elephant population is finally increasing, and the tourists are coming. "It is a war against poachers, but poachers are obviously just the first step in a chain of resource utilisation and resource extraction that is a massive economic force across the continent and globally," says Peter Fearnhead. "We can label the individual that might be pulling a trigger and shooting an elephant as the poacher, but ultimately you are waging a war against the illegal wildlife trade which is a key component of the greater economic scourges that we face as humanity on this planet."\1.9619101285934448,-0.28493884205818176,-1.3359686136245728,0.6334810256958008,-1.8452837467193604,-0.15739323198795319,0.9062245488166809,-1.6772785186767578,-0.39266425371170044,-0.2282434105873108,0.5112400650978088,1.6357754468917847,1.0337015390396118,-0.31761109828948975,0.07387010753154755,0.8518322706222534,-1.2563616037368774,1.829876184463501,-1.0145469903945923,0.6771813035011292,1.6937127113342285,-0.5657644867897034,0.4691613018512726,-1.1700773239135742,-0.017041796818375587,0.4840274751186371,0.7293532490730286,-0.2746220529079437,-0.009471172466874123,0.09410715103149414,-0.5234045386314392,0.7601272463798523,-0.34996119141578674,-0.3894956111907959,-0.6273042559623718,-0.6607617139816284,-0.5780710577964783,-0.8652458786964417,2.232146978378296,-0.30501338839530945,0.10656598955392838,-1.106076955795288,0.7385765910148621,0.8871058225631714,-0.6065313816070557,0.4464258551597595,1.0837146043777466,-0.5347039103507996,-1.1822607517242432,-1.13962721824646,2.4387474060058594,-0.5677769184112549,-0.8085735440254211,0.5900548696517944,1.2487455606460571,-0.5219668745994568,2.089303731918335,0.18638966977596283,-0.6071850657463074,1.767027735710144,0.03667289763689041,-0.5440096259117126,1.5557053089141846,-0.7820124626159668,-1.8018559217453003,-0.4363272190093994,1.589593529701233,1.9988584518432617,-1.1888753175735474,0.7756107449531555,1.3498237133026123,-0.9466208815574646,-1.3242088556289673,0.49149200320243835,-1.0032068490982056,-0.05431536212563515,-0.298736035823822,0.3708290159702301,-1.3566012382507324,-1.5143637657165527,0.2580055892467499,-0.6436447501182556,-3.117302179336548,1.8413654565811157,0.20549914240837097,-0.4165889620780945,0.5438443422317505,0.3533196747303009,1.1823418140411377,1.7470678091049194,-1.7320425510406494,0.8602744340896606,-1.3624869585037231,0.39814871549606323,0.45037660002708435,0.10212085396051407,0.04496943578124046,0.1872624009847641,-1.2423095703125,0.44071000814437866\BBC\Back from the brink\2017-12-27 11:36:24.0\
1815\Science\The past year has been a busy one for hurricanes. There were 17 named storms in 2017, 10 hurricanes and six major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) - an above average year in each respect. The 10 hurricanes formed consecutively, without weaker tropical storms interrupting the sequence. The only other time this has been recorded was in 1893. Are these storms getting worse? And does climate change have anything to do with it? This Atlantic hurricane season has been particularly bad. There was Harvey, which pummelled the United States in August. It brought the largest amount of rain on record from any tropical system - 1,539mm. It caused the sort of flooding you'd expect to see once every 500 years, causing $200bn of damage to Houston, Texas. Ironically, this was the third such "one every 500 years" flood Houston had suffered in three years. September brought Irma, which devastated Caribbean communities. It was the joint second strongest Atlantic hurricane ever, with sustained winds of 185mph. Those winds were sustained for 37 hours - longer than any tropical system on record, anywhere in the world. Next came Hurricane Maria - another category 5 hurricane, with sustained winds of 175mph - which destroyed Puerto Rico's power grid. Finally, Hurricane Ophelia span past Portugal and Spain - the farthest east any major Atlantic hurricane has ever gone. Despite this, 2017 wasn't the worst year in some key respects. It didn't produce the strongest storm - that was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with sustained winds of 190mph. Nor did it have the greatest number of storms - that was 2005, which saw an incredible 28 named storms, including seven major hurricanes. One of them was the infamous Hurricane Katrina. But 2017 was probably the costliest. Estimates for the cost of the hurricane season vary and continue to be revised, ranging up to $385bn. By comparison, 2005 racked up $144bn in damage according to the National Hurricane Center - about $180bn today, adjusted for inflation. It has certainly been a bad year. But over time, are hurricanes getting worse? There have been 33 of the strongest category 5 hurricanes since 1924. Eleven of these have occurred in the past 14 years. We know that hurricanes are powered by warm seas and over the past 100 years global average sea temperatures have risen by about 1C. But when you look at the total strength of storms in each year since records began, some years are more fearsome than others. Meteorologists use something called accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) to calculate the total wind power of all the storms in any given year. As you can see from the following chart, there's no clear upward trend. Why not? Even though seas are getting warmer, other factors can prevent hurricanes forming in particular years. Saharan dust can interfere with hurricane formation as can the close proximity of African storms to the equator. But one of the great weather ironies is that hurricanes hate strong winds. Strong winds in the Atlantic interfere with the circulation of air through a developing storm. This stops the storm growing into a hurricane. During a phenomenon called El Niño, the Pacific Ocean near the equator gets warmer than usual. This affects global wind patterns, leading to stronger winds in the Atlantic. That means El Niño years tend to be quiet years for hurricanes. But when the Pacific is cooler (known as La Niña), the reverse is true - making it easier for hurricanes to form. And 2017 is a La Niña year. In fact, the total storm strength in La Niña years has been rising decade by decade. High winds are just part of the story. Climate change affects hurricane seasons in other ways, too. Rainfall during hurricanes can be devastating. Hurricane Harvey would have brought severe flooding to Houston regardless of climate change. But it is reasonable to assume that Harvey brought more rain than it would have done 100 years ago. Global air temperatures have also increased by about 1C in the past 100 years, and warmer air holds more water. That's likely to be behind the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events seen in the US in recent decades. But the location of housing compounded the damage. Houston's population has more than doubled since 1960 to more than two million people. Housing developments are expanding into more marginal, poorly drained land. This puts more people in harm's way. Climate change is also causing seas to rise. Melting glaciers and land-based ice sheets contribute to higher sea levels. Also warmer water occupies a larger volume. So as seas warm up, sea levels rise. In the US, the largest sea-level rise is around the coast of the Gulf of Mexico - about 9.6mm each year at Eugene Island, Louisiana. All of this is increasing vulnerability to flooding when hurricanes and their associated storm surge reach land. A warmer world is bringing us a greater number of hurricanes and a greater risk of a hurricane becoming the most powerful category 5. There's an increased risk of flood damage - whether related to climate change, rising sea levels or more people moving into flood-prone areas. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

1816\Science\A British team is developing a car that will be capable of reaching 1,000mph (1,610km/h). Powered by a rocket bolted to a Eurofighter-Typhoon jet engine, the vehicle aims to show its potential by going progressively faster, year after year. In 2018, Bloodhound wants to run above 500mph. In 2019, the goal is to raise the existing world land speed record (763mph; 1,228km/h) to 800mph. And in 2020, the intention is to exceed 1,000mph. The racing will take place on Hakskeen Pan in Northern Cape, South Africa. Looking back at 2017, it's been quite a year for Bloodhound. At the start of the year we were testing the fuel system, assembling the front suspension, completing the car's steering, spinning up the jet engine gearbox with the car's air starter - a list of things to fit, try and finish before the car was ready or its first runs. The list seemed endless, but we did get to the end of it, and the car ran for the first time in October. 2017 became the year of "Bloodhound is Go!" and boy did it go. Looking back on it, we wanted to do three things. We needed to start preparing the car, and training the team, to race faster than anyone has ever done before. We also wanted to show all of our 300-plus sponsors what we have achieved together so far, and to thank them for their amazing help. Most of all, though, we wanted to show the world how amazing this vehicle is and to hint at what it can (and will) achieve over the next couple of years. Based on the huge media coverage and the terrific feedback we've had, we achieved all of this and more. When we ran Bloodhound SSC on the runway at Newquay, we were asking the car to do a whole lot of things it wasn't designed for. Running on a short track (OK, 1.7 miles of runway may not sound short, but at 200mph it certainly feels short), the car had to speed up and slow down very quickly. Put it another way: we were trying to operate a supersonic land speed record car like a 5-tonne jet-powered drag racer. The thing that still surprises me is just how well the car did that, and how easy it made it look. This car is like nothing I have driven before: its performance is simply astonishing. The car is now back in pieces, with the EJ200 jet engine removed and "inerted" once more. If the EJ200 is not used for 90 days or more, all of the pipework is flushed through and filled with an "inerting" fluid that prevents corrosion. This is a standard procedure for a jet engine, to make sure it's in tip-top condition for next year's runs. It might look a little sad to see it end such a successful year in pieces, but that is the life of a prototype racing car. Even without the need to inert the EJ200, we would still have to strip the car down, to clean and protect all the metal components from corrosion. At Newquay we were out in all weathers to get the testing completed, which meant that the car occasionally got damp. Some of you may have noticed the condensation building up in the cockpit during our first public runs, following rain early that morning. As a result, the first time we took the car to 200mph, I had a misted-up windscreen and helmet visor. Now we need to make sure that the whole car is thoroughly dried out, and cleaned and oiled (or greased, lubricated, coated, treated, etc.) where necessary, ready to re-assemble for more adventures in 2018. Talking of 2018, we're off to South Africa! Next year is going to be "Bloodhound 500", as we aim to get the car above 500mph for the first time. It's taken far longer than we wanted, but finally the car is ready for some high-speed testing. Personally, I think we might get a wee bit faster than 500, but you'll have to wait until next year to find out. The aim is to get over halfway to our ultimate goal of 1,000mph, to develop and test the basic platform of our jet-powered chassis, steering, brake parachutes, desert wheels, so that it's ready to receive the rocket pack, which is still under development. We're still watching desert conditions closely, thanks to Surrey Satellites and their superb pictures. After a reassuringly dry year, the first signs of water have just started to appear at the top of Hakskeen Pan. We can expect more flooding over the next few months, as the wet season repairs and improves the desert surface, ready for Bloodhound's first runs next year. As well as testing the car at much higher speeds, Bloodhound 500 is another chance to show the car off to a global audience. We will be testing the live video and data streaming, relayed through the huge 70-metre-tall MTN phone/data masts, then out to the world thanks to Oracle's global cloud services. Next year we'll be finding out how this car handles at 500+ mph. Want to come along for the ride? Thanks to MTN, Oracle and co, the live streaming will let you do just that. We're also going to take the opportunity to offer small groups of VIP visitors a personal trip to see the car run. I've talked to a lot of people about watching a land speed record car run, although I confess I haven't seen it myself (I've been busy each time, inside the car). Every one of the spectators tells me that it's an unforgettable sight, so next year is a chance for some lucky people to see Bloodhound run at high speed for the first time. To that end, we're offering a limited number of "Access All Areas" passes. Come and join the next step in our "Engineering Adventure" with a visit to Hakskeen Pan - you can find more details on the project's website at Bloodhound 500. Running the car next year will also give our key audience - the young engineers and scientists of tomorrow - their first chance to follow the car's high-speed development. We're thrilled by the fact that we are already reaching over 100,000 students a year in the UK alone, with a much larger number following Bloodhound around the world. With higher speeds, and live video and data streaming, we are (as you would expect) aiming for even bigger audiences. We're also going to be busy running our various events at the Bloodhound Technical Centre. This includes our build-your-own rocket car workshop. If you're looking for something to do over the Christmas holidays, there's still time to book your place for one of our rocket car experiences. Go along, go fast, and enjoy.

1817\Politics\French President Emmanuel Macron has arrived in the UK for a summit with Theresa May. It comes as as the UK announced an extra £44.5m to be spent beefing up Channel border security. The money will be spent on fencing, CCTV and infrared detection technology in Calais and other border points. Britain is also expected to commit to taking more migrants from Calais, especially unaccompanied children, the BBC understands. But the announcement has been criticised by some Conservatives, with Dover MP Charlie Elphicke telling the BBC the UK should not be "footing the entire bill for the French border at Calais" after it leaves the EU. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said that while Britain and France were heading in different directions as a result of Brexit, both governments were keen to show that they would continue to work closely together. Other commitments being unveiled include the deployment of three RAF Chinook helicopters in Mali, where French forces are fighting Islamist militants, and France sending more troops to reinforce a British contingent in Estonia on Nato's border with Russia. On what is his first visit to the UK as president, Mr Macron is also expected to announce the loan of the Bayeux Tapestry for display in the UK. By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner Britain and France have an incredibly close partnership in confronting the shared threat of terrorist attacks inspired or directed by so-called Islamic State. So close, in fact, that this is the first ever meeting of "The Quint" - the heads of all five British and French spy agencies, both domestic and foreign. They will be discussing, among other things, the lessons learnt from last year's terror attacks in Manchester, Barcelona and London. There is a permanent "open door" for French intelligence officers who need to visit MI5 headquarters at Thames House in London and a similar arrangement exists for British case officers visiting France's equivalent, the Direction Générale de la Sécurité Intérieure (DGSI). MI5 officers were rushed to Paris in the wake of the 2015 Bataclan attack to help follow up intelligence leads and glean any possible lessons. Read more from Frank Thursday's summit has prompted fresh scrutiny of the border arrangements between France and the UK. During last year's French election campaign, Mr Macron said he wanted to renegotiate or scrap the 2003 Le Touquet agreement, which established French border controls in Britain and UK controls in Calais. The agreement means undocumented migrants barred from entering the UK stay in France - many in makeshift camps. Up to 700 migrants are in the area, despite the camp known as the "Jungle" having been dismantled in 2016. The UK government is already thought to have spent over £100m on security in the area over the last three years, and officials said the number of illegal attempts to enter the UK fell from 80,000 in 2015 to just over 30,000 last year. A government spokeswoman said the latest investment was "about investing in and enhancing the security of the UK border". "Just as we invest in our borders around the rest of the UK, it is only right that we constantly monitor whether there is more we can be doing at the UK border controls in France and Belgium to ensure they are as secure as possible." Other "juxtaposed" border controls are in operation at Eurostar stations in France and Belgium. By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins Britain and France carry much the same weight in global affairs. Both sit at the world's most exclusive tables of power - the Security Council and the G7 - and the sizes of their populations and economies are broadly similar too. But while President Macron commands France, including his parliament, after last year's stunning electoral successes - the same cannot be said of Theresa May. Sharp disagreements over the UK border with France are difficult to resolve. Mrs May has conceded extra money for border security in Calais - and has separately offered Chinook helicopters to move French troops more safely over Mali. Mr Macron, meanwhile, has offered the loan of the Bayeux tapestry. But Brexit still threatens to overshadow all this bonhomie. When it comes to Europe, these two countries are pulling in radically different directions. The summit between Mrs May and Mr Macron, at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Berkshire, will also feature the first meeting of the heads of Britain and France's five intelligence agencies, and will be attended by UK cabinet ministers and their French counterparts. Downing Street said the RAF Chinooks would offer a "niche capability", providing logistical support for the French operation in Mali, but that Britain would not be committing combat troops. Speaking ahead of the summit, Mrs May said: "Today's summit will underline that we remain committed to defending our people and upholding our values as liberal democracies in the face of any threat, whether at home or abroad. "But our friendship has always gone far beyond defence and security and the scope of today's discussions represents its broad and unique nature." Laurence Haim, a former adviser to Mr Macron told the BBC's Newshour the French president likes Theresa May and speaks fluent English, but will want to make it clear to her that he will not give any ground over Brexit. France's centre-left Le Monde says President Macron will make "more modest demands" of Theresa May on the migrant issue, compared to his earlier proposal to have Britain deal with migrants on its own soil. It also notes that Mrs May is in a "difficult position" over Brexit talks with Brussels, and France can always return to the "Calais issue as a bargaining chip". Centre-right Le Figaro sees the loan of the Bayeux Tapestry as a symbolic "two-pronged diplomatic gesture" that has both delighted Britain and shown that President Macron wants to "strengthen the Paris-London axis" despite Britain leaving the European Union. The left-wing daily Liberation also sees the two leaders "sweeping their differences under the carpet... despite tensions over Brexit", in the interests of defence cooperation and Britain indicating that "it will continue to play a key role in Europe". The Catholic paper La Croix sees defence and migrants as the key issues at the summit, over which "the shadow of Brexit hovers". Like the rest of the press, it is sure that both leaders will want to affirm the "continuing relevance of bilateral cooperation between France and the United Kingdom despite Brexit".\0.1610957831144333,-0.07290410250425339,-0.8332359194755554,-1.3726211786270142,-0.34400442242622375,-1.013903021812439,2.068425416946411,-1.4302754402160645,-0.4602575898170471,-0.5277135968208313,2.133636236190796,1.045982837677002,-0.6133451461791992,1.050444483757019,-1.0464966297149658,-0.3506038188934326,-1.0348011255264282,-0.6246079206466675,0.8864743113517761,-0.16516876220703125,0.5961207151412964,-1.2280691862106323,-0.8174210786819458,1.1164331436157227,0.2011565864086151,0.9147365689277649,1.1405171155929565,0.9929943680763245,-0.29317498207092285,-0.9701783657073975,-0.7179363965988159,-0.22207309305667877,-0.2732377052307129,0.030520044267177582,0.39522361755371094,0.09469864517450333,-1.6794077157974243,-0.6512985229492188,1.069556713104248,-1.9126567840576172,-1.723412036895752,-1.236375093460083,0.34961649775505066,-0.07659805566072464,-0.9714638590812683,0.45792120695114136,0.6152931451797485,2.9822816848754883,-2.097541093826294,0.3108401596546173,1.1509615182876587,-0.45974627137184143,1.7172107696533203,-0.9462904930114746,0.601405680179596,-1.0862352848052979,2.413700580596924,-0.7144678831100464,0.21580763161182404,0.22711998224258423,0.4172709882259369,-0.7537521719932556,0.05679239705204964,0.5404056906700134,-1.9640579223632812,1.4818730354309082,1.4450880289077759,0.5977689027786255,-0.6894246935844421,1.3880870342254639,0.766744077205658,0.04121550917625427,-1.76250422000885,-0.7387551069259644,-0.6682711243629456,0.36928942799568176,-0.09925606846809387,-1.638516902923584,-0.5137779116630554,-1.1409311294555664,0.05932499095797539,-0.011760661378502846,-1.4537734985351562,0.543279230594635,-0.04451889172196388,-0.39057767391204834,1.1130726337432861,0.4378010630607605,1.9755696058273315,-0.7906630635261536,0.4616979956626892,0.19054287672042847,-0.25873255729675293,-0.22522258758544922,-0.7785982489585876,0.5262904763221741,-1.1413761377334595,-0.8574530482292175,-1.0835257768630981,0.012832757085561752\BBC\Theresa May meets Macron with pledge of extra £44m for border\2018-01-18 16:39:28.0\
1818\Politics\A fresh round of talks aimed at restoring devolution in Northern Ireland has been announced by the Northern Ireland secretary. Talks involving all five main parties will begin next Wednesday, 24 January. Karen Bradley, who was appointed last week, was flanked by the Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney as she made the announcement. Mr Coveney said progress must be made in "weeks rather than months". Mrs Bradley said "time is short" but there was one last opportunity to restore the Stormont executive. She said she believed an agreement was possible and that it was vital that all parties are involved. The talks will be short and intense and "progress must be swift", she added. "The gaps are narrow but there are still significant differences to overcome." Mr Coveney said all parties had a responsibility to restore devolution, adding that the Irish government would spare no effort to do so. Significant progress had been made during previous rounds of talks, he said, suggesting an agreement was possible. Discussions between the DUP and Sinn Féin ground to a halt in October. Sinn Féin's northern leader Michelle O'Neill said her party was willing to take part in the talks, adding it should be a "short, sharp process". The DUP's Simon Hamilton said he believed new talks would help the parties "build on progress that has been built to date". He added: "While I am reluctant to talk about deadlines, it is more than apparent that time is short." Last week, the UUP, SDLP and Alliance Party urged a quick resumption of talks to re-establish a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. Speaking to BBC Good Morning Ulster, Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann welcomed the suggestion to include all five parties. He said part of the difficulty in making progress was that it has been "a two-party process since June". Mr Swann reiterated his party's opposition to an Irish language act, one of the main sticking points in the talks. He said Sinn Féin had to be "realistic" if it wanted to a part of the solution, saying its red lines were holding up the process. Alliance party leader Naomi Long gave a cautious welcome to the announcement of new talks but reiterated they need to be all-party with an independent mediator if they were to have any possibility of success. "We not only need a change of pace in these talks but a marked change in attitude from the two largest parties, if we are to see the Assembly restored," she said. "The appointment of an independent facilitator would be another significant step forward and we are disappointed that has not yet happened." While the leader of the SDLP, Colum Eastwood, welcomed a new round of talks, he said his party "will not negotiate blind". "The progress that was made between the DUP and Sinn Féin, that we were all told about, needs to be published so the public and other parties can see how far they've got," he said. "We're coming at this with a will to solve the problems, and we'll see if anyone else is up to the challenge." Northern Ireland has been without an executive since last January, when the DUP and Sinn Féin's power-sharing government broke down in a bitter row. The two parties have failed to find a resolution in spite of several rounds of talks.\1.0368589162826538,0.631363034248352,-0.23473671078681946,-0.8042720556259155,-1.3284400701522827,-0.23316903412342072,0.7309672236442566,0.37885499000549316,-0.24241460859775543,-0.36360594630241394,0.8082862496376038,0.46152955293655396,1.267842411994934,-0.061971500515937805,-1.105625867843628,0.46553051471710205,0.10369137674570084,-0.4752451181411743,-1.173444151878357,0.12844260036945343,0.5088706016540527,-0.5614734888076782,-0.8987273573875427,0.35849305987358093,-0.813409149646759,0.5393664240837097,1.4938132762908936,0.7785720229148865,0.4082937240600586,0.18134662508964539,-0.0018773518968373537,0.2007506936788559,-0.957968533039093,-0.12380773574113846,0.48765572905540466,0.24302570521831512,-0.6105815768241882,0.6334134936332703,-0.17409108579158783,-0.26232072710990906,-0.34206631779670715,-2.0192043781280518,0.18968920409679413,-0.8436175584793091,0.3336947560310364,0.21392136812210083,-9.890829678624868E-4,0.17008641362190247,-1.2002025842666626,-0.2794434130191803,1.1223448514938354,-0.18326883018016815,0.6278061270713806,-0.1040707603096962,0.40630096197128296,-1.387528419494629,0.9274950623512268,0.7985024452209473,-1.37582266330719,1.2057305574417114,-0.0025618411600589752,0.6493008136749268,-0.8934316635131836,-0.1471829116344452,-1.1737772226333618,1.1280206441879272,-0.16158831119537354,0.7507171034812927,0.3148740828037262,0.0190055500715971,-0.38882699608802795,-0.29125750064849854,0.7667945027351379,0.49986356496810913,0.31171321868896484,0.15897680819034576,0.15321174263954163,0.5594335794448853,-1.879616141319275,-0.5070219039916992,0.3600826561450958,-0.08771495521068573,-0.9708965420722961,0.022641077637672424,1.0956413745880127,0.689777672290802,0.6616330146789551,0.5943033695220947,0.02238531969487667,0.35714131593704224,0.161670982837677,0.7097864747047424,-0.11689242720603943,-0.24813245236873627,-0.8927163481712341,0.41243642568588257,0.5220116972923279,-0.11374610662460327,-1.3962175846099854,-0.6592569947242737\BBC\Stormont: Fresh NI devolution talks announced\2018-01-18 16:34:10.0\
1819\Politics\Nus Ghani has made history by becoming the first female Muslim minister to speak from the Commons dispatch box. Recently appointed as Transport Minister, Ms Ghani was cheered as she addressed questions about station access for disabled people. Ms Ghani, Wealden MP since 2015, is the daughter of Pakistani immigrants. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said her promotion proved the Tories "were a party of opportunity", having produced the first woman prime minister as well.

1820\Politics\Margaret Thatcher looks set to lose out to two pioneering feminists in the battle to be the first woman to have a statue in Parliament Square. Rival campaigns have battled for years to be first to put a statue of a woman in front of the Houses of Parliament. The race was won by advocates of suffragist and trade union leader Millicent Fawcett. She is set to join the 10 men in the square, including Sir Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela, later this year. A rival campaign, led by former Conservative MP Sir Neil Thorne, and backed by the first female Commons Speaker Baroness Boothroyd, argued Emmeline Pankhurst should have been immortalised in bronze instead, as she is far better known than Ms Fawcett. Westminster Council has not ruled out a statue to Ms Pankhurst in the square at some stage - provided campaigners move an existing statute of the suffragette leader that stands in nearby Victoria Gardens first, but they seem to be less convinced of the case for a Thatcher monument, even though it has already been created by sculptor Douglas Jennings. Advocates of a Lady Thatcher statue stayed out of the Pankhurst/Fawcett battle, despite a planning application for a monument to Britain's first woman prime minister being considered by Westminster Council at the same time. The council's planning committee is due to vote on the Thatcher proposal next Tuesday, but council officers have recommended refusal. The Royal Parks Agency, which owns the land, and the Metropolitan Police have expressed concern that a Thatcher statue would attract protests. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors also objected to having a statue of the Iron Lady near its Parliament Square headquarters because she was a "controversial character" who would be likely to be a target for vandalism and "abuse". "This could easily extend to our building and, potentially, to our staff and professional members who use the building. "There is a physical risk if projectiles are thrown at the statue and hit the building and/or individuals direct," said RICS in its submission to the council. But council sources say the biggest factor influencing the decision - apart from there already being too many statues in the area - is likely to be the fact that the Thatcher family had objected to the design. Officials also cited the "10-year rule", which suggests monuments to leaders should not be erected until at least a decade after their death, although this rule was broken to allow a statue of Nelson Mandela in 2007. Richard Beddoe, chairman of Westminster City Council planning, said: "The council is unable to comment on outstanding planning applications. This scheme will be considered on its merits and in line with council policy at our planning committee on 23 January." The Millicent Fawcett statue, designed by Turner Prize-winning artist Gillian Wearing, will commemorate the centenary of women winning the right to vote. The original design had to be amended as councillors were concerned Ms Fawcett - who is carrying a banner reading "courage calls to courage everywhere" - looked like she was hanging out washing, according to the Daily Telegraph. Ms Pankhurst favoured more radical and militant tactics than Ms Fawcett, who founded the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in 1897, in the battle to win women the vote. Historian and sociologist Pamela Cox, who presented two BBC documentary series' Shopgirls and Servants, argued that both women should be commemorated in bronze. "There are so few statues of women in the capital - and indeed - across the country. We can surely afford to commemorate both de facto leaders of the women's suffrage campaign," said Ms Cox, in a submission to the council. But Westminster Council said the existing statue of Ms Pankhurst would have to be moved before they would consider erecting another one in the square opposite Parliament.\0.06192883849143982,-0.3300304412841797,-0.47902390360832214,-0.06278713047504425,0.38322731852531433,0.9766080975532532,0.8936693668365479,0.07471799105405807,-0.9440746903419495,-1.2753905057907104,0.6115339994430542,0.7789230942726135,0.06846905499696732,1.2727758884429932,-0.8929334282875061,0.43401166796684265,-0.02313041314482689,-0.36029529571533203,-0.19327205419540405,0.8559035062789917,-0.16758990287780762,-1.5423732995986938,0.19693894684314728,0.7840623259544373,-0.14171114563941956,0.08868549764156342,0.6388002634048462,-0.0485745444893837,0.19667264819145203,0.5967465043067932,0.14496470987796783,-0.1541915088891983,-0.6520337462425232,0.17184680700302124,0.4734588861465454,0.23923207819461823,-1.2529175281524658,-0.4327422082424164,-0.9520773887634277,-0.26505181193351746,-0.723404049873352,-0.33584168553352356,-0.48547834157943726,-0.16895221173763275,-0.23864611983299255,0.3673509955406189,-0.28745800256729126,0.502433180809021,-1.622909426689148,-0.7748197913169861,0.4331919848918915,-1.6084742546081543,0.4060603082180023,-0.09006217122077942,1.4128080606460571,-0.5524688363075256,1.4195159673690796,-0.6530986428260803,-0.8723087906837463,0.5495834350585938,0.15356676280498505,0.012863720767199993,1.2041863203048706,-0.011379662901163101,-1.549527883529663,0.9106640219688416,0.2563639283180237,1.4891836643218994,0.09503653645515442,0.5506163239479065,-0.8924558758735657,-0.022506074979901314,-0.5853186845779419,0.41735032200813293,-0.007465545553714037,0.7906070351600647,0.1970440298318863,-0.28912338614463806,0.5707419514656067,0.4609149396419525,0.5675237774848938,0.5479130744934082,-0.6608172655105591,0.10397753864526749,0.5782979130744934,-0.5150037407875061,0.3923896849155426,0.8888891339302063,-0.34640881419181824,0.12140678614377975,-0.882719874382019,0.8477343320846558,-1.5257067680358887,-0.06919217109680176,0.14684073626995087,0.641933023929596,0.5100744366645813,0.4259684979915619,-0.1087031364440918,-0.017713818699121475\BBC\Margaret Thatcher set to lose out in Parliament Square statue battle\2018-01-18 14:21:15.0\
1821\Politics\Financing projects such as schools and hospitals privately costs taxpayers billions of pounds more than public sector alternatives, parliament's spending watchdog says. A report suggests a group of schools cost 40% more to build and a hospital 70% more to construct than if they were financed by government borrowing. The National Audit Office report identifies costs and benefits of PFI. The Treasury said it only approved PFI contracts that were value for money. The collapse of Carillion, which was working on numerous PFI projects, has renewed criticism of such schemes. The NAO report, which was written before the collapse of Carillion, found 716 public projects were active under PFI and its successor PF2, with annual costs amounting to £10.3bn in 2016/17. PFI projects will cost the taxpayer a further £199bn by the 2040s, it said. The watchdog said the cost of raising capital was higher for PFI projects compared with government-raised funds, and found there were other additional costs. However, the government said PFI projects improved public services, offered better value for money and shifted risk away from the public sector. A spokesperson said the Treasury disagreed with the NAO's analysis that privately financed projects were 40% more expensive, because the NAO had not looked at all the more than 700 PFI schemes in operation. The 40% figure comes from an analysis of 12 current privately financed school building projects in north west England, as measured against the NAO's estimate of the costs if they had been financed publicly. PFI contracts were first introduced under John Major's Conservative government. Under such deals, private consortiums build facilities such as schools, hospitals and roads, in return for regular payments over as many as 30 years. Liverpool City Council is paying more than £4m each year for Parklands High School which stands empty and unused. The secondary school which boasts sports hall, canteen and science labs was used for only ten years before it was put into special measures by Ofsted, and closed down in 2014. It is now dubbed a "ghost school" by locals. The school cost an estimated £24 million to build and between now and the end of the contract 2028, will incur a bill of £47 million, which includes interest, debt and facilities management payments. PFI use proliferated under Tony Blair's Labour government, but PFIs fell out of favour after the 2008 financial crisis, as the cost of private finance increased and as questions were raised over their efficacy. Since then, the Departments for Health and Education have used the new PF2s which the Treasury argues are more transparent and "better value for money". "Taxpayer money is protected... as the risks of construction and long-term maintenance of a project are transferred to the private sector," a Treasury spokesperson said. However, the NAO said there had never been a "robust evaluation" of the benefits. It said the expected spend on one group of schools financed by PF2 were around 40% higher than the costs of a similar project financed by government borrowing. It also said Treasury Committee analysis from 2011 estimated the cost of a privately financed hospital was 70% higher than a comparative project in the public sector. The watchdog highlighted the increased cost of borrowing which it said was 2% to 3.75% higher for PFIs compared to state borrowing. "Small changes to the cost of capital can have a significant impact on costs," the report said. "Paying off a debt of £100m over 30 years with interest of 2% costs £34m in interest. At 4% this more than doubles to £73m." The report also identified other reasons for higher costs at PFIs including insurance, fees for external advisors, fees for arranging borrowing and the cost of producing and auditing accounts. The report said PFI was designed to limit uncertainty over cost over-runs and provide incentives for better long-term maintenance of assets. But Meg Hillier MP, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said the NAO had found "little evidence" that PFI's benefits offset its additional costs. "I am concerned that Treasury has re-launched PFI under new branding, without doing anything about most of its underlying problems," she said. "We need more investment in our schools and hospitals but if we get the contracts wrong, taxpayers pay the price." But she said many local bodies were now "shackled to inflexible PFI contracts that are exorbitantly expensive to change." The GMB union said it showed PFI to be "a catastrophic waste of taxpayers' money" and that it should mean "the game is up for PFI". At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urged the government to end the "costly racket" of private sector firms running public services.\0.17586438357830048,0.7050513029098511,-2.1920807361602783,-0.1543649435043335,0.5237734317779541,-0.4584827721118927,-0.003477213904261589,0.9620234966278076,-0.3918944001197815,-0.8913609981536865,-0.238791361451149,1.3544998168945312,-0.39234602451324463,-0.4158351421356201,0.5426162481307983,0.2775670886039734,-1.152536153793335,0.16152502596378326,-0.04747655615210533,0.5884541273117065,-0.023510169237852097,-0.48623940348625183,-0.9444786310195923,-0.3603074550628662,0.011997692286968231,1.3823590278625488,1.0982859134674072,0.36794960498809814,0.5268492698669434,1.2111693620681763,-1.6410012245178223,1.0817300081253052,-0.41788798570632935,-1.222448706626892,0.3566264808177948,-0.11966606229543686,0.9457923769950867,0.9947918057441711,0.9117905497550964,0.5800694823265076,0.28304383158683777,0.6219746470451355,-0.4176533818244934,-0.4055827260017395,-0.8522865772247314,0.8633149862289429,1.361318588256836,-0.06358718872070312,-0.32857128977775574,-0.25376754999160767,0.5708664059638977,-0.5698806047439575,-0.9025524854660034,0.9130863547325134,0.5284808278083801,0.33197587728500366,-0.15132276713848114,-0.3107359707355499,0.7020449638366699,0.7981650233268738,-1.290479302406311,-0.15535402297973633,0.6699728965759277,1.4135229587554932,-0.8167696595191956,-0.48126858472824097,-0.2053525149822235,2.623699426651001,-0.4964408278465271,-0.17617572844028473,0.7707222104072571,-0.907321572303772,-1.9141955375671387,-1.0416730642318726,0.8450350165367126,0.1267072558403015,-0.9210827946662903,0.2503611743450165,-0.14762672781944275,-1.1630629301071167,-0.3419114351272583,-0.8325644731521606,-1.0795258283615112,0.5751505494117737,-0.06691528111696243,-0.46792781352996826,0.33588236570358276,-0.14872115850448608,-0.04508649557828903,0.35340848565101624,-0.11295845359563828,0.7053145170211792,-0.3754011392593384,-0.7580458521842957,0.13559508323669434,-0.5823663473129272,1.5766791105270386,-0.9866505861282349,-0.937027633190155,1.1375668048858643\BBC\PFI deals 'costing taxpayers billions'\2018-01-18 14:39:22.0\
1822\Politics\Former Education Secretary Justine Greening has criticised the government over its plans to expand Heathrow. The MP for Putney, which is close to the West London airport, said she believed the proposals were "flawed". Ms Greening quit the Cabinet last week after refusing a job as work and pensions secretary. But Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said he believed expansion of the UK's biggest international airport was "hugely important" for the UK. The clash came as Ms Greening used transport questions in the Commons to claim the latest evidence suggested the plan was "more expensive, lower value, more congesting, noisier and provides fewer connections". Mr Grayling said he had already had a number of discussions with Ms Greening about the issue and said Heathrow expansion was "strategically important" for the UK. But speaking from the backbenches, Ms Greening asked: "On what evidence is the government now pushing ahead with what I believe to be a flawed plan for expanding Heathrow?" She added: "Will you meet me to discuss this?" Mr Grayling replied: "I know how strongly you feel about this. "You and I had many conversations about this and I know we will carry on doing so. You and I, of course, don't share the same view. "I believe this project is strategically important for the United Kingdom, but I'm happy to come and discuss it with you." On Wednesday, Ms Greening told the Commons that a future generation of MPs will seek to "improve or undo" Brexit if it does not work for young people.\0.7675793170928955,-0.3453855812549591,0.04772748425602913,-1.0651973485946655,0.03023139387369156,0.018824301660060883,0.2224138081073761,-0.014124255627393723,-0.1768539994955063,0.19738848507404327,0.3756120502948761,0.8930642604827881,-0.16408562660217285,0.9869651198387146,-0.5878769755363464,-0.7340396642684937,-0.09200419485569,0.184095561504364,0.08691093325614929,0.3031678795814514,-0.3773418962955475,-0.47330543398857117,-0.14759281277656555,-0.4245070517063141,-0.32788553833961487,0.25112271308898926,1.0444753170013428,0.2640824019908905,0.5524054765701294,-0.011398307047784328,-0.013045194558799267,0.4946037232875824,-0.8577836155891418,-0.3857041299343109,0.11730754375457764,0.3409166634082794,-0.05162425339221954,0.15874920785427094,0.020351065322756767,0.04646577686071396,-0.21111918985843658,-0.13446301221847534,0.21505384147167206,0.2758399248123169,0.4716498851776123,0.2399243712425232,0.3494102656841278,0.5982791185379028,-0.5090288519859314,0.9786253571510315,0.5717878341674805,-0.5440980792045593,0.0031406613998115063,0.34549641609191895,0.5849444270133972,-0.3788899779319763,0.31312522292137146,0.48317950963974,0.36822938919067383,0.18076017498970032,0.4959661364555359,-0.1844850778579712,0.5335017442703247,0.6650046706199646,-0.9411879777908325,0.3774777352809906,0.8648197054862976,0.701029360294342,-0.20710527896881104,0.30961328744888306,0.6948267221450806,-0.354316771030426,-0.7238667607307434,0.7521513104438782,-0.7926534414291382,-0.2572198510169983,-0.34539109468460083,-0.11868003010749817,-0.38720396161079407,0.5091305375099182,0.09278721362352371,-0.26726698875427246,-1.0913722515106201,-0.20088280737400055,1.1451836824417114,-0.15032409131526947,-0.16768766939640045,0.07929492741823196,-0.173350527882576,-0.4083995223045349,-0.6217304468154907,0.11538899689912796,-0.5352001786231995,-0.5761206746101379,-0.21180233359336853,0.12108242511749268,-0.01884402334690094,-0.4280247092247009,-0.67176753282547,0.6759883761405945\BBC\Justine Greening hits out at Heathrow expansion plans\2018-01-18 13:44:12.0\
1823\Politics\The scheme to tackle the housing crisis by converting offices to homes is back-firing and should be scrapped, local councils say. A change in the law in 2013 allows developers to convert offices to flats without going through the planning process. But the councils said it also allowed developers to duck their responsibility to provide affordable housing. The government says the system is creating badly-needed homes. According to the Local Government Association (LGA), in many places more than half of all new homes have been developed under the scheme - including nearly three quarters in Stevenage. However, it says the system - known as permitted development - undermines the vibrancy of cities where homes, shops and offices are jumbled together. It also makes it hard for people to keep fit by walking or cycling to work. Under the normal planning process councils can insist on developers contributing towards providing social housing, schools and roads. But the LGA is angry that by avoiding the normal planning process developers can escape without making a contribution. The LGA's Martin Tett said: "The conversion of offices into flats is one way to deliver much-needed homes, but we can't have developers ducking their responsibility to provide affordable housing and infrastructure. "It is absolutely appalling what's happening. In 10 years time people will look back and wonder how on earth we could've created desolate dormitory suburbs with no employment. "It is essential that councils have an oversight of local developments to ensure they are good quality and help build prosperous places." The picture varies from city to city. In some places offices have long lain vacant. In other areas councils report that businesses are being evicted because new flats are more profitable for property owners. "Some councils are getting desperate," Cllr Tett said. "They're trying to keep local offices but they're seeing their areas get turned into commuter suburbs." Councils warn that office space could dry up, leaving businesses and start-ups without premises. Office-to-residential conversions under permitted development rules accounted for 64% in Three Rivers, Hertfordshire, and 61% in the London borough of Sutton during 2016/17. In Nottingham, Basildon, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Hounslow and Harlow the proportion was more than half. Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey said: "Ministers are letting developers cash in without making any contribution to the community. It gives developers a completely free hand to build poorer quality homes that aren't affordable to local people." A government spokesman said: "We are determined to build the homes our country needs and permitted development rights play an important role in helping us deliver more properties. "We need a mix of dwelling types to meet different housing needs and over 17,500 additional properties were created by converting offices in the year to March 2017." Permitted development rights, he said, are only part of the overall solution for housing. The spokesman said councils have the power to remove permitted development rights where it is necessary to protect the surrounding area. But Cllr Tett told BBC News it's very hard for councils to achieve that.

1824\Politics\Parents are subsidising a new flagship "free" nursery scheme for three- and four-year-olds in England from their own pockets, a survey suggests. Nurseries are making up losses by upping fees for younger children and charging for meals and nappies, a survey of 1,662 providers suggests. The survey, by the Pre-School Learning Alliance, suggests only a third are delivering the hours totally free. The government says it is investing £6bn in childcare by 2020. It added that any charges to parents on the scheme must be voluntary. The poll of nurseries, pre-schools and childminders is the first to be carried out since the 30-hour free childcare scheme came into effect in September, and has been shared exclusively with the BBC. Families where both parents are working more than 16 hours a week, but earning under £100,000 each, qualify for the scheme. It expands the number of free hours childcare for this age group from 15 a week. But nurseries and pre-schools have long warned they will struggle to make ends meet because the hourly rates they are receiving from the government are too low. Nurseries and pre-schools have already been cross-subsidising the previous entitlement of 15 hours a week with fees from non-government funded children. According to the survey, conducted online among alliance members, over a third said they were making up losses by upping fees for younger children. And charges for items such as meals and nappies are also being made at a third of the settings that responded. Most said the hourly rates they were receiving from the government were below what they charged parents not on the scheme and failed to cover their costs. And a fifth thought they may not be financially sustainable by next year. Some already have closed their doors. And numerous local authorities are no longer promoting the scheme as "free", instead referring to the hours as "funded" in their advertising instead. One nursery told the alliance: "Funding rate not increased for the seventh year, coupled with cost of increased pension contributions and increase in living wage and minimum wage, we are seriously concerned about our future survival." More than three-quarters (some 77%) said if the funding stayed the same next year, it would have a negative impact on the business - 44% described that negative impact as "significant". Another provider said: "It does not currently seem financially sustainable. If the funding rate does not increase, the only way we can still offer the places is by charging for extras, [in other words] charging for the gap in underfunding." Chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance Neil Leitch said: "It's clear from these findings that the government's flagship childcare policy is failing both providers and parents. "Respondents have laid out in black and white that the 30 hours policy is simply not working, with a continued lack of adequate funding leaving many with no option but to pass the funding shortfall on to parents. "This has left parents to pay the price for government underfunding through often unexpected charges for things like nappies, food and trips, while the government continues to claim that it's delivering on its promise of 'free' childcare." He said that since the policy had been announced, the childcare sector had repeatedly said the scheme would not be sustainable in the long term. "Thousands of parents and providers have now joined our Fair Future Funding campaign to demonstrate their concerns. "The government should not have needed more evidence of a childcare funding crisis - but here it is." He added that if ministers did not want to leave parents picking up the tab, or more nursery closures, they needed to increase funding urgently. The National Day Nurseries Association chief executive Purnima Tanuku said: "These are extremely worrying findings and sadly echo our own research over the last year. "The government needs to be honest with providers and parents that 30 hours funded childcare is not 'free'. "There is a significant shortfall between government funding rates and the cost to nurseries of providing childcare." For example, in Suffolk the funding rate is £3.87 per child, per hour, compared to the £5.20 per child, per hour it costs to deliver a place. A Department for Education spokesperson said: "We are investing a record amount of around £6 billion every year by 2020 in childcare and have doubled the free childcare available to working parents to 30 hours a week, saving them up to £5,000 a year per child. "Providers can choose whether to offer 30 hours and what pattern of days and hours they offer parents. We have always been clear that government funding is not intended to cover the costs of meals or additional services. "However, while providers can charge parents for additional extras, this cannot be a condition of the child's place." Are you a parent with children in nursery?

1825\Politics\MPs investigating food safety breaches at chicken supplier 2 Sisters Food Group have revealed they rejected Christmas gifts sent from its boss. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee said festive packages of biscuits were sent to several members. Its chairman said the unsolicited gifts were "inappropriate" and they had been returned or given to local food banks. 2 Sisters disputed the amount and said it was a "goodwill gesture", which they send to many external stakeholders. The committee held a month-long inquiry into the food group's actions after an undercover report from the Guardian and ITV News claimed workers at its West Bromwich site were changing the slaughter dates to extend the shelf life of meat. In September, the Food Standards Agency and supermarkets Aldi, Lidl, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer also announced they would investigate the allegations. 2 Sisters is one of the UK's largest chicken suppliers but also provides biscuits, ready meals and frozen pizzas. Over the Christmas period, several committee members received care packages with a mixture of Fox's and other tins of biscuits. Labour's Paul Flynn, who sits on the committee, said the package contained "around £100 worth". But 2 Sisters says the total cost of the gift was nearer £20. MPs are required to declare any gifts, benefits and hospitality over a value of £300. Chairman Neil Parish, a Conservative MP. said members had found the actions of Ranjit Singh Boparan, 2 Sisters' chief executive, "very disappointing". "Sending gifts to committee members at a time when we are trying to rebuild trust in the poultry industry is most unhelpful. "Mr Boparan should instead concentrate on restoring confidence in our poultry supply chains, and we are keen to work with him to do so." He wrote to the 2 Sisters chief executive asking him to "avoid similar gestures in future". A 2 Sisters Food Group spokesman said: "Each gift was around eight packets of Fox's and Own Brand Biscuits, in addition to two tins or boxes of Fox's biscuits. "The business sends these out every year as a goodwill gesture at Christmas to hundreds of external stakeholders. "We have responded formally to Neil Parish on the above."\0.8235863447189331,0.529690146446228,-0.5388847589492798,0.5908458232879639,0.366784930229187,-0.1534111350774765,0.2157641500234604,0.24199219048023224,-0.06892064213752747,-0.8878470659255981,0.5719814896583557,0.46361151337623596,0.508028507232666,0.22075970470905304,0.7035223841667175,0.3959939777851105,-0.8742727637290955,-0.2476843148469925,0.45241743326187134,0.15428045392036438,-0.08424296975135803,0.5169070363044739,0.6229674220085144,0.13415808975696564,-1.0032597780227661,0.9487183690071106,0.6046441793441772,0.31995338201522827,0.17998920381069183,0.08346976339817047,-0.08821382373571396,0.34011781215667725,-0.33941394090652466,-0.6051881909370422,0.5612333416938782,-0.06730984151363373,0.20299585163593292,0.7261579632759094,-0.11359406262636185,-0.3650056719779968,-0.10785898566246033,-0.47175753116607666,0.7346580624580383,0.403154581785202,-0.2758769392967224,-0.3750423192977905,0.4083625376224518,-0.6956875324249268,-0.5689991116523743,0.3785737454891205,0.5439769625663757,-0.36144211888313293,0.44350311160087585,-1.0415571928024292,0.4174944758415222,0.44443774223327637,0.2985502779483795,-0.8423874378204346,-0.10914354771375656,0.7232679724693298,-0.04691468924283981,0.5957809686660767,0.08929163217544556,0.2827536463737488,-0.23772329092025757,0.5106260180473328,0.5408193469047546,1.1786777973175049,-0.9208073019981384,0.7126712799072266,-0.7772396206855774,0.49541258811950684,-0.5770542025566101,0.7248818278312683,0.724881112575531,-0.23824481666088104,0.49027448892593384,-0.0911363959312439,-0.15218865871429443,-0.4266764521598816,-0.4799998104572296,-0.0862768217921257,-0.5467950701713562,0.14376510679721832,0.16213546693325043,0.5780459046363831,0.33166417479515076,0.16517460346221924,0.1819854974746704,-0.47007066011428833,-0.542214572429657,0.2922994792461395,-0.6546207070350647,0.042853232473134995,-0.041124943643808365,7.45470286346972E-4,0.5083180069923401,-1.2171235084533691,-0.5840356349945068,0.3818306624889374\BBC\2 Sisters chicken supplier 'sent MPs Christmas biscuits'\2018-01-18 16:04:27.0\
1826\Politics\Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have gone head-to-head at Prime Minister's Questions. What happened? As expected, their clashes were dominated by the collapse of government contractor Carillion. Labour's Catherine McKinnell got the ball rolling with a call to protect the future of the firm's 1,400 apprentices. Mrs May reeled off some broad reassurances about protecting jobs and services but seemed to be taking forever to get round to the subject of apprentices - prompting cat calls from the Labour benches. She eventually said the minister responsible would be "looking very carefully" at what could be done to help the apprentices. The PM got a brief respite from Tory MP Simon Hoare - who hailed productivity growth - before Jeremy Corbyn got to his feet. The Labour leader's first question - on why the government ignored profit warnings - led to a lecture from Mrs May on the meaning of the term "profit warning" and some pre-prepared swipes at Labour politicians, in Wales and Leeds, allegedly handing out contracts to Carillion after profit warnings had been issued. Mrs May refused to answer Mr Corbyn's next question, about whether the government was negligent in ignoring the warning signs, claiming it was not a question. After a dramatic pause, as he battled to contain his anger, Mr Corbyn shouted his question across the despatch box at the PM. The Labour leader had another go, asking why nobody from the government - a Crown representative - was in post overlooking the company during a crucial period. Mr Corbyn broadened out his attack to focus on the "super rich" - and the pay and bonuses going to Carillion's chief executive. Mrs May said the Official Receiver was looking into the issue and could recover the cash if necessary. Mr Corbyn then highlighted the plight of small businesses potentially left out of pocket by the collapse of Carillion, saying the outsourcing giant was a "notorious late payer". The Labour leader ended with an attack on the "broken system" of outsourcing public services to private companies, citing Stagecoach, Virgin, Atos and Capita as the worst offenders. Mrs May - who must have been relieved to get the end of this week's exchanges - fell back on a familiar attack on Labour's economic policies, which she claimed would "cause a run on the pound". She also defended the government's handling of the Carillion crisis, saying they had protected taxpayers from a bailout. The SNP's leader at Westminster Iain Blackford claimed people in Scotland would be £2,300 a year worse off if the UK left the single market after Brexit. Mrs May did not really engage with the issue. Mrs May breezed through the rest of the session, with barely another mention of Carillion. Tory MP Desmond Swayne - who was apparently caught napping during a speech by colleague Ken Clarke on Tuesday - piped up with a self-deprecating quip and a question about plastic waste. Tory MP Zac Goldsmith brought up the sentencing of taxi driver rapist John Worboys. Theresa May said that the case was being looked at. Here's what BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar thought: Here's BBC Parliament's Mark D'Arcy's verdict: "That could have been much tougher for Theresa May who must have thought the government was vulnerable on several fronts. Labour's questioning on the Carillion issue was well targeted and Jeremy Corbyn was able to deliver an attack on the whole idea of privatisation in the public services, which will have pleased his troops in the chamber and his supporters outside. But the PM was well briefed and had taken the precaution of having the Cabinet Minister coordinating the Government response, David Lidington, sitting next to her. So she was not wrong-footed at any stage. Conservative MPs did their best to goad Mr Corbyn during his questioning, but while he sounded angry, he didn't lose his focus, or stumble. It's another example of two ordinary parliamentary performers circling one another but failing to do any serious rhetorical damage. Each side in this gladiatorial combat will be satisfied, and I suspect nothing very much will have changed as a result of today's exchanges. Meanwhile the SNP's Ian Blackford is still struggling to match the effectiveness of his predecessor, Angus Robertson, who lost his seat at the election last June. Mr Robertson was the stand out performer in PMQs in the last parliament; Mr Blackford has yet to match his forensic well-targeted questioning."\-0.23198015987873077,0.07347527146339417,-0.12628117203712463,-1.7143757343292236,-0.931864321231842,0.36406439542770386,1.222368836402893,0.5041552782058716,-0.8182033896446228,-1.3373674154281616,0.03297651186585426,1.0409797430038452,-0.2018307000398636,0.4909827411174774,-0.8435971140861511,-0.8761918544769287,-0.030900899320840836,0.1949053257703781,-0.9435820579528809,-0.10082940012216568,-0.8238755464553833,-1.2691795825958252,-0.7465716004371643,-0.28022849559783936,-1.7990580797195435,2.0077974796295166,1.5060358047485352,0.3414086103439331,-0.39955079555511475,-0.1603091061115265,0.7642849087715149,0.6509544253349304,0.2793874144554138,0.23768176138401031,0.20861677825450897,0.37983986735343933,-0.8136717081069946,-0.024751976132392883,-0.06351380050182343,-1.2382985353469849,-0.6961222290992737,-0.6714234352111816,2.5410826206207275,0.2831461727619171,1.6087981462478638,-0.5656083226203918,0.9214270710945129,0.010526507161557674,-1.4218947887420654,-0.006459858268499374,1.1076794862747192,-0.715174674987793,-0.638020396232605,-0.06233900412917137,0.4248037040233612,-0.17090468108654022,2.040128469467163,-1.116421103477478,-1.16647469997406,0.3702232241630554,0.3813364803791046,0.4939008951187134,0.9331181049346924,0.010675103403627872,-0.2340158373117447,2.056720018386841,0.685892641544342,0.05676987022161484,-0.426831990480423,0.5946507453918457,0.5391989350318909,0.4936223328113556,-1.0083202123641968,-0.4758966267108917,-0.8410407900810242,0.7799708843231201,-0.014207982458174229,0.034261491149663925,-0.37803593277931213,-0.18524304032325745,-0.3032081425189972,0.07936739921569824,-0.6879352331161499,0.029138170182704926,0.5205609798431396,0.6832118630409241,0.05015220120549202,0.07398302853107452,0.22904935479164124,-0.08210671693086624,0.6328157186508179,0.45599472522735596,-0.9536402821540833,-0.5753395557403564,-0.4680083692073822,0.6073828935623169,-0.26167336106300354,-1.1849570274353027,-1.6192288398742676,1.269988775253296\BBC\Prime Minister's Questions: The key bits and the verdict\2018-01-17 14:37:31.0\
1827\Politics\A Tory MP who appeared to fall asleep in the House of Commons has said he is embarrassed and "annoyed" with himself. Sir Desmond Swayne, who nodded off during a speech by colleague Ken Clarke, said the image of him with his head on his shoulder was "horrible". In his defence, he said he had had a "very long day", having been up swimming in London at 05:30 GMT. "I dozed off for 30 seconds," he told BBC 5 live. "That is the extent of it. It happened. It won't happen again." Sir Desmond, who is a supporter of Brexit, nodded off during the 11th day of debate on the EU Withdrawal Bill but rejected suggestions he was making a statement about Mr Clarke's pro-Remain views. The New Forest West MP said he had heard Mr Clarke's speech before but his "momentary lapse" was not because he was "bored" with proceedings but was a result of tiredness. "I was listening to Ken Clarke and I felt woozy," he told Emma Barnett. "Then all of a sudden you have gone for 30 seconds. I am annoyed I let it happen. It is embarrassing and annoying." The 61-year old said he had started the day in question "very early" with a dip in the Serpentine, a lake in London's Hyde Park, before dawn. The afternoon nap was later referred to when Sir Desmond was called to ask a question at Prime Minister's Questions - where he was greeted with loud cheers from the Tory benches. When he was a soldier, Sir Desmond - who served in Iraq in 2003 - said he had taught himself to "catnap" because of the limited opportunities for repose. "I am sure everyone has experienced that feeling when you are really tired and you just feel yourself going," he told Emma Barnett. "I have a very long day. I have a great deal to do. Most people have busy lives and busy jobs and I'm sure they've experienced it as well." As debate on the EU bill resumed in the Commons on Wednesday, Mr Clarke said he was glad to see Mr Swayne sitting behind him again. "When I arrived I inquired whether he'd had a cup of coffee before today's long proceedings," he said, adding that he was trying to have "no soporific effects" on those MPs who had "survived" the lengthy discussions on the Bill. Speaking on 5 live, fellow Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin said it was "not good to be seen to be asleep on the job". However, he said he had sympathy for his colleague as it was "pretty easy to feel droopy" after a busy day and given the rather close atmosphere in the chamber. He joked that in the days before Commons proceedings were first televised in 1989, MPs used to go into the Chamber for a nap. "It's only the advent of television that means you can't go in to the House of Commons and have a snooze." But Labour's Chuka Umunna questioned whether people who were unable to stay awake in the Commons should remain as MPs.\0.8131538033485413,0.6809884309768677,-0.6639617681503296,-0.2761436104774475,0.435543030500412,0.917978823184967,1.9015952348709106,0.052716080099344254,-0.7297249436378479,-0.1706172674894333,0.01693127490580082,1.6027541160583496,0.6560086607933044,0.7969135046005249,-0.7404366731643677,0.9328264594078064,0.28824442625045776,-0.08136707544326782,-0.46167483925819397,0.1765914112329483,-0.0739901214838028,0.740006685256958,-0.8901774883270264,0.4538857340812683,-0.8020622730255127,0.7592757344245911,0.9139413833618164,0.671299159526825,-0.6591190099716187,0.5382412672042847,0.7880967259407043,0.2207314372062683,0.48714038729667664,-0.10539165139198303,0.36242473125457764,0.23821702599525452,-0.18412965536117554,-0.3589242994785309,-0.2657623589038849,-0.6998093128204346,-0.4155625104904175,-0.09041406214237213,0.7740578055381775,0.04533272609114647,1.0731719732284546,0.527749240398407,1.1856467723846436,0.42263147234916687,-1.73387610912323,-0.3993624746799469,1.215421199798584,-1.130982518196106,-1.1740093231201172,0.5833637714385986,0.2662854790687561,-0.7972148060798645,0.4387441873550415,-0.8032944202423096,-0.5570744872093201,1.7837384939193726,-0.049515921622514725,0.40784165263175964,0.5415498614311218,-0.5103042125701904,-1.1457644701004028,0.9381744265556335,0.8611319661140442,0.17743352055549622,-1.625182867050171,0.8499742150306702,0.8730432391166687,0.17845658957958221,-0.8429144024848938,0.39635777473449707,-1.6586214303970337,0.027396440505981445,0.8363742232322693,0.9324412941932678,-1.6461353302001953,0.18197697401046753,-0.13532693684101105,-0.44043511152267456,-1.2827354669570923,0.3880278766155243,1.4901407957077026,0.34621915221214294,0.23828481137752533,1.3981951475143433,-0.5369321703910828,1.0915619134902954,0.5653176307678223,0.5383813381195068,-1.2758229970932007,0.04382425546646118,-0.10248757153749466,-0.08437700569629669,-0.6660940647125244,-0.7354317903518677,-1.3539516925811768,0.2954981327056885\BBC\Sir Desmond Swayne 'embarrassed' by Commons snooze\2018-01-17 17:42:17.0\
1828\Politics\Facebook is to re-examine whether Russian groups used its social media accounts to try to influence the outcome of the Brexit referendum. The tech giant found "a minimal amount" of UK-related activity when it looked into one particular group last year. But after a request from MPs, it will investigate whether there was "co-ordinated activity" by other outfits. Theresa May has accused the Russian authorities of meddling in foreign elections and spreading disinformation. In a speech in November, she said Russia's attempts to "sow discord" in the West could not go unchallenged and warned President Vladimir Putin: "We know what you are up to." Following a request by the Electoral Commission last year, Facebook Ireland looked into whether an organisation known as the Internet Research Group had used its platforms to spread disinformation during the Brexit vote. Facebook told the BBC last month that it believed the group's output amounted to just three UK-related adverts which had reached no more than 200 UK-based viewers over four days. But MPs pressed for further action and in a letter to Conservative MP Damian Collins, Facebook's UK policy director, Simon Milner, said it would now cast its net wider by looking at other potentially suspicious "clusters". "We have considered your request and can confirm our investigatory team is now looking to see if we can identify other similar clusters engaged in co-ordinated activity around the Brexit referendum that was not identified previously," he wrote. "This work requires detailed analysis of historic data by our security experts... "We are committed to making all reasonable efforts to establish whether or not there was co-ordinated activity similar to that which was found in the US." Facebook has asked Mr Collins, who chairs the Commons Culture, Media, Digital and Sport Committee, whether he can provide intelligence which may provide evidence of "illegal" online activity of the kind that the US authorities have said occurred during the 2016 Presidential election. Mr Collins welcomed the fresh action by the social media giant. In January, the US director of national intelligence identified the Internet Research Group as a vehicle for spreading misinformation. But Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said recently he had not seen any evidence that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 referendum - about which the Kremlin has insisted it remained neutral.\0.8704095482826233,-0.040273215621709824,-0.25300756096839905,-1.1293004751205444,0.9311364889144897,0.08208399266004562,0.4043854773044586,-0.1067674309015274,-0.5056388974189758,-1.2487908601760864,0.11778616160154343,0.7193577289581299,-1.1278694868087769,0.5856056213378906,-0.8528400659561157,0.11204589158296585,-0.19615627825260162,-0.15743418037891388,0.07050374895334244,0.036632172763347626,0.32491108775138855,0.316383421421051,-0.2201230525970459,0.260751873254776,0.020890679210424423,0.3478183150291443,0.6604682207107544,-0.04860696941614151,0.6343933343887329,-0.3286657929420471,0.11210330575704575,-0.007781967520713806,-0.1190543845295906,-0.0548696294426918,0.2575836777687073,0.024297811090946198,-0.4794723689556122,0.17775942385196686,-0.13760031759738922,0.27036741375923157,-0.595982551574707,-1.2015740871429443,0.5642750263214111,-0.3345588147640228,-0.08170788735151291,-0.35470685362815857,-0.7959651350975037,0.4696865379810333,-0.7643961310386658,-0.09745338559150696,-0.2277403622865677,-0.597974419593811,0.04029492661356926,-0.3638423979282379,0.7593180537223816,-0.5201223492622375,1.3619368076324463,0.5153928995132446,-0.6709709167480469,0.5907033681869507,0.1330007165670395,0.3264355957508087,0.34615176916122437,-0.2995750606060028,-0.647273063659668,-0.31408506631851196,0.8203526139259338,0.6956827640533447,-0.9422866702079773,0.7656956315040588,0.7830107808113098,0.4690762460231781,-0.9192513227462769,-0.5165024399757385,-0.6308333277702332,-0.5466251373291016,-0.4923941195011139,-0.04901626333594322,-0.34352314472198486,-1.4177515506744385,0.3841050863265991,0.6480311751365662,0.23422423005104065,0.4476722776889801,0.5362167358398438,0.4924185574054718,0.5328542590141296,0.36282527446746826,0.5712164640426636,-0.44481316208839417,0.47093766927719116,0.09923727065324783,-1.5211068391799927,0.046805281192064285,0.22218745946884155,0.8352721929550171,0.5116705298423767,-0.8330932259559631,-0.5434538722038269,0.22940047085285187\BBC\Facebook to reconsider claims of Russian interference in Brexit vote\2018-01-17 19:11:39.0\1764, 1828
1829\Politics\Jeremy Corbyn has called for an end to the "costly racket" of outsourcing public services as he clashed with Theresa May over Carillion's collapse. The Labour leader told MPs that the failed firm and other private sector suppliers offered poor value for money and should be "shown the door". Financial warnings were ignored to try to keep Carillion "afloat", he claimed. The PM said government was a "customer not a manager" and had put safeguards in place to protect public contracts. Work on construction sites run by Carillion, whose collapse on Monday has put thousands of jobs at risk, is to pause while decisions are made over their future, the Insolvency Service announced earlier on Wednesday. But work on most of Carillion's private sector service contracts, such as catering and cleaning, is to carry on until new suppliers can be found. The issue dominated Prime Minister's Questions, with Mr Corbyn accusing Theresa May and other ministers of "negligence" by continuing to award Carillion contracts in the second half of 2017 despite the firm issuing a series of profit warnings. Carillion, he suggested, was symbolic of a failed model of outsourcing which rewarded a handful of companies and their directors for poor levels of service and left the taxpayer to pick up the tab for failure. "This isn't one isolated case of government negligence and corporate failure - it's a broken system." "Under this government, Virgin and Stagecoach can spectacularly mismanage the East Coast Main Line and be let off a £2bn payment. "Capita and Atos can continue to wreck the lives through damaging disability assessments of many people with disabilities and win more government-funded contracts. "G4S promised to provide security at the Olympics - failed to do so and the Army had to step in and save the day. These corporations need to be shown the door - we need our public services provided by public employees with a public service ethos and a strong public oversight. "As the ruins of Carillion lie around her, will the prime minister act to end this costly racket of the relationship between government and some of these companies?" But Mrs May insisted that full oversight was maintained of the firm's public sector business over the summer and the taxpayer was not having to bail out the firm after it went into liquidation. "We were a customer of Carillion, not the manager of Carillion, and that is a very important difference," she told MPs. "We're making sure in this case that public services continue to be provided, that workers in those public services are supported and taxpayers are protected." A third of Carillion's public sector contracts were signed off by the last Labour government, she pointed out, while its most recent customers included the Labour-run government in Wales and Labour-run Leeds Council. But she said a Corbyn-led government, which has pledged to renegotiate all existing PFI contracts with the goal of nationalising many of them, would starve the public sector of all outside investment. "What Labour oppose isn't just a role for private companies in public services. It's the private sector as a whole," Mrs May argued. Amid calls for bonuses paid to Carillion executives to be clawed back, the PM said the Insolvency Service was fast-tracking an investigation into the collapse of the firm and the conduct of its current and former directors.\-0.3654705882072449,1.1234239339828491,-0.042917754501104355,-0.48918718099594116,-0.5568527579307556,-0.11445322632789612,2.192251205444336,0.7804502844810486,-0.4027845859527588,-1.1777554750442505,0.48149311542510986,0.4866415560245514,-0.6210218071937561,-0.42563408613204956,-0.5615405440330505,-0.043032776564359665,-0.3380340337753296,0.07441011816263199,0.0032312918920069933,0.18142378330230713,0.4416729807853699,-0.30386093258857727,0.5237886905670166,-0.1008213683962822,-0.25970005989074707,1.2022638320922852,0.7779247760772705,-0.266218364238739,-0.3190370500087738,0.9083483815193176,0.24978187680244446,0.1459560990333557,0.16326205432415009,-0.571815550327301,0.09509550034999847,-0.24468712508678436,0.3009083569049835,0.4961971640586853,1.2846571207046509,-0.04193767160177231,0.18515342473983765,-0.8409558534622192,0.47286754846572876,-1.406341552734375,0.20870763063430786,-0.716486394405365,-0.45257362723350525,0.045882612466812134,-1.3721598386764526,0.23290014266967773,-0.5449959635734558,0.2538256347179413,0.6108986139297485,-0.4412107765674591,-0.05142354220151901,-0.042862631380558014,0.23255127668380737,-0.3341723680496216,-0.5523579120635986,-0.69525146484375,-0.6173430681228638,-0.14470979571342468,0.5898035764694214,1.3986797332763672,-1.0067270994186401,0.03923206031322479,1.5239473581314087,1.0739212036132812,-1.2150485515594482,0.9594952464103699,0.7448280453681946,-0.176139235496521,-0.1966710090637207,-0.7359535694122314,-0.5190687775611877,0.6022620797157288,0.438214510679245,0.6898667216300964,-1.253392219543457,-0.09004610031843185,0.5495311617851257,-1.2140491008758545,-1.3945164680480957,-0.05888417735695839,0.22872138023376465,1.744294285774231,0.4323733150959015,0.05547856166958809,0.07433585077524185,0.23658974468708038,0.8718439340591431,-0.26482489705085754,-0.11937737464904785,0.12304724007844925,-0.4598272740840912,-0.17892701923847198,0.8186677098274231,-0.11245439946651459,-0.9554656744003296,1.6597859859466553\BBC\Jeremy Corbyn urges end to outsourcing 'racket'\2018-01-17 16:58:36.0\
1830\Politics\MP Jared O'Mara is to resume duties in his constituency and Parliament after a 12-week absence, his office has said. The Sheffield Hallam MP was suspended by the Labour Party in October over misogynistic and homophobic comments he is alleged to have made. Mr O'Mara has apologised for online remarks from 2002 and 2004 but denies some more recent claims. He was signed off work by his GP on 13 December but has said he now intends to resume duties on a "phased return". More stories from across Yorkshire In a statement posted on his website, a spokesman said Mr O'Mara will be resuming his duties "with immediate effect." He added: "The phased return, on medical advice, will see Jared taking up duties both in Parliament and the constituency." Mr O'Mara said he was "pleased" to be returning to work and was "delighted to be moving forward and able to represent my constituents". News of his return comes a day after a newspaper reported some of his constituents were calling for him to resign and trigger a by-election. The 35-year-old MP resigned from the women and equalities committee after political website Guido Fawkes unearthed offensive comments he had made online in 2004. More comments, involving homophobic language, then emerged dating back to 2002. Sophie Evans, who had met Mr O'Mara on a dating app before he was elected, told the BBC's Daily Politics he had made comments to her that "aren't broadcastable". Mr O'Mara apologised for remarks in 2002 and 2004 but "categorically denies" Ms Evans' allegation. The MP hasn't spoken publicly in Parliament or his constituency since his apology on 23 October. A Labour party spokesman said it hoped to conclude its investigation into Mr O'Mara soon.\0.40154722332954407,-0.31108227372169495,0.45533499121665955,-0.6655901670455933,0.6384543180465698,0.6923849582672119,0.6341831088066101,0.38097259402275085,-0.9834858775138855,-0.907896101474762,0.5808839201927185,0.2976715564727783,-0.3487657904624939,0.09996982663869858,-1.109350323677063,0.28634193539619446,0.49108874797821045,0.009968304075300694,0.03574448823928833,0.6734533309936523,0.35598939657211304,-0.473863810300827,-0.03822751343250275,-0.08216995745897293,-0.6455606818199158,0.8446751236915588,0.5612396001815796,0.5404525995254517,-1.1687123775482178,-0.5188167691230774,0.8895895481109619,0.10206247866153717,-0.38326629996299744,0.43945610523223877,0.6081580519676208,0.6180734038352966,0.2313307672739029,0.4280688166618347,-0.22538787126541138,-0.9344865083694458,-0.6890484094619751,-0.6084959506988525,0.4241463840007782,-0.3441777229309082,-0.12927019596099854,-0.07681293040513992,0.2583700120449066,0.6299083232879639,-2.0780065059661865,-0.03501692786812782,1.1745820045471191,-0.2646180987358093,-1.1793553829193115,-0.29575634002685547,0.9866993427276611,0.521782398223877,0.7878211736679077,-0.6539642214775085,-0.26741066575050354,0.7899667620658875,1.9146993872709572E-4,0.10330069810152054,1.024235486984253,0.26522424817085266,-0.7459729313850403,1.3438551425933838,0.15480758249759674,1.114317774772644,-1.0028663873672485,0.0392405204474926,0.5099023580551147,-1.216363787651062,0.19364716112613678,0.703475296497345,-1.1004992723464966,0.15755683183670044,0.8888009190559387,0.5144017934799194,-0.6901618242263794,0.219243124127388,0.23968398571014404,-0.18600942194461823,-0.3338371813297272,0.7481716275215149,0.5599506497383118,0.08132801949977875,0.8083540797233582,0.5941330194473267,0.5514011979103088,0.6245844960212708,0.16960129141807556,0.36289212107658386,-1.3777722120285034,-0.12273397296667099,-0.5969829559326172,0.34653884172439575,-0.3936240077018738,-0.7722671627998352,-0.5706812739372253,-0.12744486331939697\BBC\Sheffield Hallam MP Jared O'Mara to resume duties\2018-01-17 12:41:46.0\
1831\Politics\A future generation of MPs will seek to "improve or undo" Brexit if it does not work for young people, a former cabinet minister has said. Justine Greening - who quit as education secretary in last week's reshuffle - said MPs had a duty to make sure Brexit was "sustainable". She was speaking as the Commons debated the government's EU (Withdrawal) Bill. MPs have now voted to back the bill which means it moves to the House of Lords. Ms Greening resigned from government last week after refusing the move from education to the Department for Work and Pensions she was offered by Prime Minister Theresa May. Speaking for the first time from the backbenches, the Putney MP said: "I represent a very young constituency here in London. "The bottom line is that looking ahead, if Brexit doesn't work for young people in our country in the end it will not be sustainable. "When they take their place here they will seek to improve or undo what we've done and make it work for them. "So we do absolutely have a duty in this House to look ahead and ensure that whatever we get is sustainable and works for them." Asked about Ms Greening's comment, Theresa May's official spokesman said: "The prime minister is clear that she is determined to deliver a Brexit which works for all sections of society. Of course that would include young people." The draft EU bill has already been the subject of highly charged debate in the Commons, facing hundreds of attempts to change its wording and suffering one government defeat. Ministers were not expected to lose Wednesday evening's third reading vote, and it passed by 324 votes to 295. But there have been warnings of trouble further ahead when the House of Lords takes over. The government can seek to overturn any changes inflicted by the Lords. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and the EU (Withdrawal) Bill is a key part of the government's Brexit strategy. It aims to end the supremacy of EU law, which would be copied into UK law in order to ensure a smooth transition on Brexit day. Much has been said about Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, under which the UK gave formal notice of Brexit in March. But now the head of the European Commission has said the UK could always reapply to join - using Article 49. Article 49 sets out the procedure for new countries wanting to join the EU. On Tuesday EU Council chief Donald Tusk suggested the UK would be welcome to stay in the EU if it changed its mind about leaving - comments that were dismissed by Brexit campaigners. Speaking at the European Parliament on Wednesday, Mr Juncker said: "We are not throwing the British out, we would like the British to stay, and if they so wish, they should be allowed to do so. "In London, there was a rather irritated response to this proposal (to stay in the EU), but note that even if the British leave according to Article 50 then Article 49 would allow them to accede again and I would be happy to facilitate that."\0.6224393844604492,0.0742487758398056,-0.35993340611457825,-0.18497805297374725,0.22980673611164093,0.30844536423683167,1.1142054796218872,-0.8655253648757935,0.20398962497711182,-1.3104802370071411,0.8939462304115295,0.8946132063865662,0.511267364025116,1.1989845037460327,-0.16650955379009247,0.1670571267604828,0.7826560735702515,-0.22886529564857483,0.016816379502415657,-0.21152150630950928,0.12275320291519165,-0.39880919456481934,-0.5294143557548523,-0.19909490644931793,0.0222349651157856,0.19207344949245453,0.2418529987335205,0.36671730875968933,-0.014774361625313759,0.278602659702301,-1.0361143350601196,-0.5498464107513428,0.29086795449256897,-0.15524093806743622,0.6639391779899597,0.4422140121459961,-0.0593620128929615,-0.18313239514827728,-0.3934800922870636,-0.43446552753448486,-0.21579082310199738,-0.12294439226388931,0.5337565541267395,0.08021457493305206,0.27831918001174927,0.8479685187339783,0.01585114374756813,0.4324091672897339,-0.8735784888267517,-0.43173930048942566,0.7501179575920105,-0.6158199906349182,-0.16435319185256958,0.39696863293647766,1.4999988079071045,-0.33867570757865906,0.9701593518257141,-0.8636084794998169,0.2851596772670746,0.41445139050483704,0.026005849242210388,0.568292498588562,0.9990153312683105,0.016234466806054115,-0.9079525470733643,0.19274039566516876,0.5302775502204895,1.1614052057266235,-1.2301825284957886,1.44864821434021,0.5878375768661499,-0.02130824141204357,0.05035993829369545,-0.7520434260368347,-0.5153573751449585,0.5393423438072205,0.03535248711705208,2.2009482383728027,-0.2926739752292633,0.14580798149108887,0.6278546452522278,0.5678603053092957,-1.122083067893982,0.7249663472175598,0.20083893835544586,0.726370096206665,-0.06737152487039566,-0.21569523215293884,-0.29857122898101807,-0.1692017912864685,0.09397078305482864,-0.3059235215187073,-1.0447971820831299,-0.710425853729248,-0.16084857285022736,0.7714166641235352,0.1926036924123764,0.3048088848590851,-1.1793862581253052,0.38056138157844543\BBC\Justine Greening: Next generation of MPs could 'improve or undo' Brexit\2018-01-18 00:01:41.0\
1832\Politics\Bosses and directors of Carillion will not get bonuses or severance payments, the government has said. The Insolvency Service said no such payments had been made since the construction firm collapsed on Monday. The announcement comes as work on Carillion's public sector construction sites is paused pending decisions about their future. However, work on most of its private sector service contracts, such as catering and cleaning, will carry on. Carillion's customers want existing services to continue until new suppliers can be found and will provide funding to retain staff for the moment. Several former executives of the firm would have received pay and benefits this year. On Wednesday, Business Secretary Greg Clark met representatives of some banks to seek assurances that they would support small businesses affected by the Carillion collapse. Afterwards, he said UK lenders were ready to give "tailored support" and flexibility when it came to repayments. About 30,000 smaller firms which have been working on Carillion projects in the private sector face an uncertain future and are waiting to learn whether they will be able to get hold of money owed to them. HMRC said it will also help affected contractors, offering them more time to pay tax bills and providing workers with cash support through the tax credits system. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hit out at the "wildly excessive" bonuses paid to Carillion directors. He also accused the government of negligence, saying it awarded contracts to Carillion even when it became clear the company had problems. Mr Corbyn also called on the government to end the "costly racket" of private sector firms running public services. Mrs May said a third of government contracts with Carillion were agreed by the previous Labour administration, adding she wanted to provide "good quality public services, delivered at best value to the taxpayer". Earlier GMB union boss Tim Roache had said the government's response to the Carillion crisis had been "inadequate and inept". He said that his union had called on Mr Clark to set up a task force to help private sector companies and employees affected by Carillion's collapse. He called on other private sector companies to take on affected workers without a change in their terms and conditions - a process that he admitted would not be a short one.

He told BBC 5 live Breakfast they had withdrawn the cleaner they had working full-time in a local prison. "We'd been chasing them for money, we hadn't been paid since July and when we heard the rumours about a week-and-a-half ago that Carillion were in a lot of trouble, we really pressed. "Fortunately for ourselves, we did actually get paid the money that was owed to us for the work that she'd done between August and November. "We've pulled our cleaner out at the moment and we're just still waiting to hear from them what's happening next before we send her back in again. "It looks like we are going to lose the December invoice money that we've sent them and obviously the first two weeks of January. "It's been an ongoing battle since we've been in there to get paid and we're not prepared to take the risk while they're in liquidation. "Until we see something in black and white saying that, 'Yes, you will get paid on these set terms,' then we will consider sending our cleaner back in again." Carillion went into liquidation on Monday after rescue talks with its lenders and the government failed to reach a deal. The UK's second-biggest construction company ran into trouble after losing money on big contracts and running up debt of about £1.5bn. The company employed 43,000 people worldwide, including 20,000 in the UK, and the government has said staff and contractors working on public sector contracts will continue to be paid.

1833\Politics\Twenty people died after ambulance delays over 12 days when a trust failed to move into its highest state of emergency, an MP has said. Labour's Clive Lewis told the Commons senior managers wanted to move East of England Ambulance Service Trust to so-called REAP 4 on 19 December. Mr Lewis said the decision was not taken until 31 December. The trust said it experienced "significant pressure" over the winter period. The Norwich South MP said the trust could have called in the army and added that it did not seek aid when it eventually moved to the emergency status. REAP, or the Resource Escalation Action Plan, is a framework designed to maintain an effective and safe operational and clinical response for patients by ambulance trusts. Raising a point of order with Speaker John Bercow, Mr Lewis said: "I hope to get your advice on an exceptionally serious issue that's been brought to me by a whistleblower in my constituency relating to the East of England Ambulance Service. "It has been put to me that the service became critically overstretched due to high demand on 19 December, and at that point senior operational managers wanted to move to REAP 4, the highest state of emergency, and seek mutual aid, most likely from the armed forces. "However, that decision was not taken until 31 December, some 12 days later, and even then aid was not requested by senior management. "I've been informed during this period that 20 people died in incidents where ambulances arrived late." Mr Bercow suggested Mr Lewis should table questions to the Health Secretary and consult colleagues on the Labour frontbench. The ambulance service said: "We always monitor our demand and capacity and take necessary actions to protect patients, working closely with NHS Improvement and NHS England. "The trust has a robust internal process and we are investigating appropriately. "Since Christmas we have responded to in excess of 50,000 patients. Of those, less than 0.2% of patients have experienced a significant delay." A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: "These are serious claims and we urge Mr Lewis to provide the Department of Health and Social Care with evidence to substantiate them as soon as possible. "We will of course carefully examine any such evidence and take appropriate action."\0.7195507287979126,-1.0,-0.22009660303592682,1.3055262565612793,0.1272134780883789,0.49659305810928345,0.797899067401886,-1.1154285669326782,-0.7021835446357727,-0.07437765598297119,-0.5067707300186157,-0.35740867257118225,-0.31592321395874023,0.19660507142543793,-1.3773083686828613,-0.09399539232254028,0.08646585792303085,-0.14731596410274506,0.02205769717693329,-0.2530415654182434,-0.1439230740070343,0.4043532609939575,0.6524303555488586,-0.6001688838005066,-0.0827355906367302,-0.08963131159543991,0.707105278968811,-0.7173866629600525,-0.7892140746116638,-0.27677926421165466,0.593783974647522,0.7364003658294678,-0.0956292524933815,-0.7768035531044006,0.9073018431663513,-0.4675981402397156,-0.5884449481964111,-0.56484055519104,0.2951551675796509,-0.2932020127773285,-0.46069321036338806,-0.8131677508354187,0.6732332706451416,-0.6135976314544678,-0.05009099468588829,-0.11536694318056107,0.8707854747772217,9.309772867709398E-4,-0.2734573185443878,0.29276779294013977,0.6221110224723816,0.2503478229045868,0.5892446637153625,-0.3131403625011444,0.8534748554229736,-1.3983536958694458,0.45050162076950073,-0.5350396633148193,-0.8265190124511719,0.23878741264343262,-0.09147878736257553,0.1624528020620346,0.598299503326416,0.6434903740882874,0.008945966139435768,-0.44953474402427673,0.22192123532295227,1.132139801979065,-0.18200592696666718,0.8982322216033936,0.175234854221344,-0.40958988666534424,0.39599740505218506,0.20146848261356354,0.3656129539012909,-0.7678205370903015,-0.4339556097984314,0.7853024005889893,-0.2733740210533142,-0.6349453926086426,0.9869625568389893,0.018743116408586502,0.2631683051586151,-0.3184409439563751,0.0769263207912445,0.4680405259132385,0.43607595562934875,0.5442388653755188,0.362621009349823,-0.6225929260253906,-0.676494300365448,1.0904396772384644,-0.6818999648094177,-0.41182607412338257,-0.6897878050804138,0.08641994744539261,-0.8718600869178772,-0.9972783327102661,-0.14037196338176727,0.07621343433856964\BBC\East of England ambulance delays: 20 patients have died, says MP\2018-01-17 20:40:59.0\
1834\Politics\Former Peterborough MP Stewart Jackson has announced he will not stand for his old seat in the next general election. The Brexit campaigner lost the seat he had held for 12 years to Labour's Fiona Onasanya in the 2017 general election. Mr Jackson, 52, has since been working as a special adviser and chief of staff to Brexit Secretary David Davis. Peterborough Conservatives Chairman John Peach said the announcement was "not unexpected" and they "totally understand his decision". Mr Jackson confirmed on Twitter that he would not attempt to become the candidate for Peterborough at the next election and wished the next person "good luck". After losing his seat, he blamed his defeat on the Conservative manifesto, describing it as "electoral poison" and "shockingly bad". Mr Peach added: "Stewart has an important job to do helping David Davis with the Brexit negotiations and will mean he will be fully employed and away from Peterborough for periods of time over the next few years. "We totally understand his decision and would wholeheartedly like to thank him for all his time, effort and the excellent help he has provided to the residents of Peterborough over the 12 years he has been our MP."\-0.4451983571052551,-0.49471521377563477,-0.28414836525917053,-0.03559485822916031,1.009270429611206,0.39444395899772644,0.6388127207756042,0.3860006332397461,-0.9897088408470154,0.32374274730682373,0.7389917373657227,1.0675228834152222,0.5300975441932678,0.2045442909002304,-0.6120450496673584,0.042187709361314774,0.05034322291612625,0.015123289078474045,-0.17038890719413757,-0.5517616868019104,1.0034394264221191,-0.6566146016120911,0.9839609265327454,-0.03381261229515076,-0.33469438552856445,0.5194914937019348,-0.017552657052874565,0.34165892004966736,-0.2586890161037445,0.0035597868263721466,0.4746299088001251,0.2104920744895935,0.2853598892688751,0.7317648530006409,0.22769057750701904,0.49372053146362305,-0.3887428939342499,-0.23561325669288635,0.31758609414100647,-0.3785383105278015,-0.4612521529197693,0.15143904089927673,0.3881867825984955,-0.18476875126361847,-0.08798094093799591,0.25873175263404846,-0.015267708338797092,0.9707726836204529,0.11612920463085175,0.24140863120555878,0.38667282462120056,-0.2635733187198639,-0.6401304602622986,0.14179226756095886,-0.11209019273519516,-0.22831499576568604,0.10298425704240799,0.3780326545238495,-1.1800713539123535,0.7388448715209961,-0.21054567396640778,-0.24905851483345032,-0.28920525312423706,0.3790241777896881,-0.1666293740272522,0.5172975063323975,0.043174080550670624,0.22714132070541382,-0.027649836614727974,-0.14132429659366608,0.3095948398113251,-0.2510916590690613,-0.38069480657577515,0.4191465377807617,-0.3017352521419525,0.5811092853546143,-0.5259944200515747,0.05355615168809891,-0.5061250925064087,-0.3347938060760498,0.04089738801121712,0.08124516159296036,-0.18179064989089966,-0.3274533152580261,0.08073127269744873,0.3706315755844116,0.434047669172287,0.4280257225036621,-0.3149797022342682,0.46036621928215027,0.6189976334571838,0.24889664351940155,-0.6311347484588623,0.6452568769454956,-0.5653397440910339,0.10218364745378494,-0.31614214181900024,0.23003815114498138,-1.0107252597808838,-0.5310077667236328\BBC\Former MP Stewart Jackson will not seek Peterborough re-election\2018-01-17 16:59:18.0\
1835\Politics\RAF helicopters to Mali, French troops to Estonia, spy chiefs sharing intelligence. When it comes to defence and security, the Anglo-French entente cordiale has rarely been closer as their political leaders meet for their annual summit. Building on the Lancaster House agreement of 2010 between the two countries' then leaders, David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy, a landmark summit is now being held between Theresa May and President Macron of France. With the UK's looming departure from the EU, Brexit, trade and migration will inevitably feature in their discussions. The French president has been pushing for Britain to accept more migrants from Calais and to pay more towards the upkeep of the two countries' joint Channel border controls. Historically, this annual summit has always been about security and this year is no exception. The continuing threat from the Islamic State group, the conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan and West Africa, Russia's actions in the Baltics and Ukraine and the emergence of transatlantic differences over certain key issues such as Iran, are all reminders of the need to shore up bilateral ties between London and Paris, ahead of Brexit. Britain may be leaving the EU but it will remain a heavyweight partner for France when it comes to security issues. French political analyst Dominique Moisi says: "We are close allies and we are rivals - and precisely because the UK is leaving the EU we may be even more rivals. "But the international context forces us to come closer to resist terrorism because of the vacuum left by the US." So, what are the defence and security issues up for discussion at Sandhurst? Britain and France have an incredibly close partnership in confronting the shared threat of terrorist attacks inspired or directed by so-called Islamic State. So close, in fact, that this is the first ever meeting of "The Quint" - the heads of all five British and French spy agencies, both domestic and foreign. They will be discussing, among other things, the lessons learnt from last year's terror attacks in Manchester, Barcelona and London. There is a permanent 'open door' for French intelligence officers who need to visit MI5 headquarters at Thames House in London and a similar arrangement exists for British case officers visiting France's equivalent, the Direction Générale de la Sécurité Intérieure (DGSI). MI5 officers were rushed to Paris in the wake of the 2015 Bataclan attack to help follow up intelligence leads and glean any possible lessons. As well as bilateral links like this, the primary mechanism for sharing intelligence between European partners is the Counter Terrorism Group (CTG). Heads of European agencies meet at least once a year, their subordinates more often. The concern over Brexit has long been the risk that Britain could be denied access to certain EU bodies, such as Europol. In fact, say insiders, the business of counter-terrorism is likely to continue as usual. Sir Julian King, EU Security Commissioner in Brussels, told me in October that the terrorist threat facing all of Europe was so great that no-one wanted to take any risks by reducing counter-terrorism cooperation with London. Theresa May, who was Home Secretary for six years until she became PM in 2016, will be keen to see this intelligence-sharing with Paris maintained and even increased. Lord Peter Ricketts, who was both national security adviser and then UK ambassador to Paris until 2016, says Anglo-French co-operation has improved dramatically since 2000. "From what I saw as ambassador in Paris, the two counter-terrorism communities and law enforcement communities are now finding they've got things to learn from each other so it is not nearly as polarised as it was 15 years ago," he said. Despite recent UK defence cuts, Britain and France remain far ahead of other European nations when it comes to deploying combat forces overseas. In Mali and other Saharan nations, French forces have been battling a jihadist insurgency for five years. They've asked for British help, and now they are about to get it. Britain is to send three RAF Chinook transport helicopters to support the French operation in Mali, along with 50-60 support staff. French political analyst Dominique Moisi says: "France wants to share responsibility with other European powers, convincing them that the Sahel is becoming a primary objective in the fight against terrorism, as it is receding in Syria and Iraq after the defeat against ISIS." As if by way of return, France is to send troops to join the UK-led battle group in Estonia where 800 British soldiers are helping to guard Nato's eastern flank with Russia. This is all part of a growing military alliance between Europe's only two nuclear powers and permanent members of the UN Security Council. The two nations are working on a joint Unmanned Aerial System for future drones. A French Brigadier was put in charge of a UK division for two months while a British Army Brigadier did the same in France. Joint exercises are being held with a view to building up a combined intervention force of 10,000 troops by 2020. There is a precedent for that, which did not end well: Libya. The Nato air campaign in 2011 was initially successful, driving back the forces of Colonel Gaddafi which threatened to massacre the residents of Benghazi. Mr Cameron and Mr Sarkozy were briefly feted as saviours of that North African nation. Thereafter Libya deteriorated into chaos, and Western nations were reluctant to get drawn into any kind of occupation role after the experience in Iraq. So the end-result of any future interventions, whether in the Middle East, Asia or Africa, will need to be very carefully thought out. The cross-channel co-operation on domestic counter-terrorism is matched to some extent by the links between MI6 and its French counterpart, the DGSE. The UK's closest intelligence-gathering partner remains the US but it also has strong bilateral arrangements with France, Germany, Spain and other European nations' agencies. A former British intelligence officer says that old Anglo-French rivalries overseas had given way to shared goals. He said there was a common desire for Britain's expertise, such as in cyber, to remain accessible to European agencies after Brexit, effectively ring-fencing intelligence and counter-terrorism from ongoing arguments in other areas such as trade and migration. There is Brexit, says a Whitehall insider, and then there is security.\0.8786522150039673,0.5212490558624268,-1.4888545274734497,-0.6065672039985657,-0.5485503673553467,-0.04888366535305977,1.7635598182678223,-2.0100560188293457,-0.3567642867565155,-1.157805323600769,1.110413908958435,0.8399049639701843,0.0774361714720726,1.3907175064086914,-0.9008573293685913,-0.5608213543891907,0.4281298518180847,-0.3942093849182129,0.5255916118621826,-0.2972222864627838,0.392194539308548,-0.1428440809249878,-0.8210131525993347,0.6971242427825928,0.3613166809082031,0.8417721390724182,1.738065242767334,-0.07133828848600388,-0.03143163025379181,-0.4258936047554016,-0.7515158653259277,0.6309896111488342,-1.1901851892471313,-0.6550461649894714,0.010511547327041626,0.1952606439590454,-1.3488281965255737,0.9575431942939758,0.5618627071380615,-1.156936764717102,-0.7442362904548645,-1.5939408540725708,-0.38290295004844666,0.5620266199111938,-0.662853479385376,0.4203905463218689,0.2022741287946701,2.034271001815796,-2.382443428039551,-1.1486496925354004,1.1906441450119019,-0.7019438743591309,1.4906957149505615,0.4225195348262787,0.815555989742279,-1.352411150932312,3.2676002979278564,-0.2146122306585312,-1.5532824993133545,0.24543564021587372,0.5516610741615295,0.06647912412881851,-0.37038367986679077,0.2327614277601242,-1.95261812210083,0.29988545179367065,1.8694050312042236,1.6086740493774414,0.16816051304340363,1.1854220628738403,1.8910222053527832,0.5419610142707825,-0.7830585241317749,1.2864395380020142,-0.043942004442214966,0.9089047312736511,0.1938616931438446,-0.8094238042831421,-0.5170242190361023,-1.4606128931045532,-0.19618649780750275,-0.9268427491188049,-1.670100212097168,0.01554784644395113,-0.1646347939968109,-0.38126882910728455,0.806373655796051,-0.3845255970954895,0.4570273160934448,-1.0170025825500488,0.34782660007476807,0.9687594771385193,-1.0156221389770508,-0.11382302641868591,-0.5294079184532166,0.6473384499549866,-1.2601866722106934,0.5979719758033752,-1.6301987171173096,1.0352611541748047\BBC\Summit agenda\2018-01-18 01:06:34.0\
1836\Politics\A campaign to teach children about copyright infringement on the internet, is employing cartoons and puns on pop stars' names, to get the message across. Even its makers admit it is a "dry" and "niche" subject for a cartoon aimed at seven-year-olds. But the Intellectual Property Office adds learning to "respect" copyrights and trademarks is a "key life skill". And it is hoping the adventures of Nancy and the Meerkats can finally make intellectual property "fun". The series, which began life five years ago on Fun Kids Radio, was re-launched this week with the aim of getting its message into primary schools. The Intellectual Property Office - formerly known as the Patent Office - has produced a range of teaching materials for Key Stage 2 in the national curriculum, for seven- to 11-year-olds. The five-minute cartoons tell the story of would-be pop star Nancy, a French bulldog, who battles her ideas-stealing, feline nemesis, Kitty Perry, and teaches friends, including Justin Beaver and a rather dim Welsh sheep called Ed Shearling, about the importance of choosing an original band name and registering it as a trademark. Most of the lessons are delivered by Nancy's sharp-suited but avuncular manager, Big Joe. The Intellectual Property Office is leading the government's efforts to crack down on internet piracy and protect the revenues of Britain's creative industries. The government agency is spending £20,000 of its own money on the latest Nancy campaign, which is part-funded by the UK music industry. Catherine Davies, head of the IPO's education outreach department, which already produces teaching materials for GCSE students, admitted IP was a "complex subject" for small children and something of a challenge to make accessible and entertaining. But she added: "In today's digital environment, even very young people are IP consumers, accessing online digital content independently and regularly. "They are creators of IP, and many will leave school or university to take up careers in industries that depend upon inventiveness and creativity. "A basic understanding of IP and a respect for others' IP rights is therefore a key life skill." But some fear the IPO is being too heavy-handed in its warnings about piracy and that the message could backfire. Jim Killock, director of the Open Rights Group campaign, said: "Some of the material seems misleading, in particular the episode explaining that downloading is the same as stealing from a shop. "While it's wrong, it is neither the same in law - as downloading is a civil wrong while theft is a crime - nor is it a convincing analogy. "The IPO risk educating children that copyright law is stupid and immoral by putting forward simplistic arguments like that." Public information films - such as the much-loved Charley Says campaign - warned a generation of children about the dangers of playing with matches or going off with strangers The genre has declined since its 1970s heyday, although Charley the cat made a comeback in 2014 in an electrical safety campaign voiced by comedian David Walliams.

1838\Politics\He has moved from the margins to the mainstream. A left-wing activist for more than 40 years, Jon Lansman was elected to Labour's ruling body for the first time on Monday. As the founder of Momentum - the grassroots group that aims to keep the spirit and politics of Jeremy Corbyn's initial leadership campaign alive - he has been instrumental in shifting the centre of political gravity away from Labour's MPs and towards its activists. After winning his place on the ruling National Executive Committee, he promised to use his position to "push for a massive expansion in Labour's community organising programme". "For too long, politics has been top-heavy and Westminster-centric," he said. "We need a socialist Labour government that works in tandem with experienced activists on the ground, who understand their communities and are given the resources and training to transform them for the better." But some of his internal opponents - who would describe themselves as moderates, or centrists - believe his ambitions go far further. They say what might seem like an obscure development in a meeting room at Labour's HQ demonstrates a willingness by Jon Lansman's Momentum allies to flex their political muscles. Ann Black may not be well-known outside Labour circles but often comes top or near the top of the ballot for election to the party's NEC and - until lunchtime on Tuesday - chaired its powerful disputes committee. She's not on the right but the left of the Labour Party. However, she had irked some in Momentum when she had agreed to rules which made it harder for newer members to vote in the second Labour leadership election - potentially favouring Jeremy Corbyn's opponent, Owen Smith. So she was ousted in what was described as "a pointless and divisive move" by a left-wing member of the NEC. She was replaced by Christine Shawcroft - a leading figure in Momentum. The group couldn't do this on its own - representatives of unions such as Unite, as well as shadow cabinet members, backed the change. But there are concerns among Labour members who see themselves as moderates that a similar alliance will try to change the party's rules to make it easier to ditch MPs who continue to be unenthusiastic about Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. The party is currently undertaking a "democracy review" - a look at its internal structures - under the auspices of Katy Clark, the former MP who is now the Labour leader's political secretary. But the terms of reference of her review do not include what's known as the "mandatory" - or automatic - reselection of Labour MPs. And I understand some of the representatives of the trade unions on Labour's NEC which are usually supportive of Jeremy Corbyn - and who voted for the removal of Ann Black - wouldn't back changing the rules on parliamentary selections. So even if the moderates' fears were realised and Jon Lansman and his Momentum colleagues did want to add this issue to the party's democracy review, they would potentially face defeat - or, at the very least, delay until after this year's Labour conference. But Richard Angell of Progress - seen as a moderate or modernising group by its members but criticised as a Blairite faction by its internal opponents - argues that Jon Lansman is not someone who respects due process: "He is in a hurry and he will push home his advantage. "He knows if his support can build so quickly, it can recede as quickly." He cites the re-opening of councillor selections in Birmingham as an example of where the party has given in to pressure from the left. And he warns that sitting Labour MPs could still face a challenge under existing rules - where local members already have the power to "trigger" an open contest and make MPs compete against all-comers. But left-wing union sources agree with Richard Angell on one point - there could be a practical constraint on this. The Progress director told me: ''The party wants to go into the next election appearing to be united. If well-known hard-working MPs - some of whom get 80% of the vote - are deselected, that will be a big sign, a siren sounding, to tell potential voters that the party they supported - a Labour Party they recognise - has changed. "Those voters won't necessarily accept whatever candidate is foisted on them. And with Labour and the Tories deadlocked in the polls this might just be the game-changer the Conservatives are looking for." So if the polls remain tight, this may not happen. There has also been both dismay and disbelief amongst anti-Corbyn parliamentarians over press reports that MPs who are deselected would sit as independents. The number of MPs who seem willing to consider this doesn't quite make a handful. There are various reasons why it is unlikely that this number would expand. Looking at marginal seats which are currently selecting candidates, there has not exactly been a clean sweep for left-wing aspirants. In many areas former candidates, prominent councillors and even a former MP have been chosen over Momentum-backed alternatives. So even where sitting MPs may be challenged, there is no guarantee that they would lose a ballot of local members. That suggests that mass deselections are probably not on the agenda. Nonetheless, some MPs may well be chucked out - though there is a view that this might be due to their performance (or lack of it) as much as their politics. But if, as one moderate put it, they then "sit in a huff, that might simply expose just how few followers they have". A Labour source was more blunt: "If these people are currently keeping their head down, why would they suddenly grow balls just because they had been deselected? They won't break ranks." The former MP Simon Danczuk stood as an independent at the 2017 election and lost his deposit - gaining fewer than 900 votes - so in the absence of a plan to create a new centre party, there seems little incentive for MPs who are deselected to sever their ties with Labour rather than stay and fight. And some Corbyn-sceptics believe there is a lot to fight for. One Labour MP pointed out to me that four out of five party members didn't take part in the NEC elections so while Momentum "has the activist base it doesn't have the full membership. "There's lot to play for." And a leading MP who backed Eddie Izzard's unsuccessful bid to be elected to the NEC is suggesting that the party's "moderate" members have to play a smarter campaign. They, too, thought that Jon Lansman's vote was lower than anticipated and thought it was significant that the comedian got more voters than any other candidate, apart from the three who had Momentum's backing. "Eddie fought a non-tribal, non-factional campaign around issues of diversity. He made it clear he'd campaign to get Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street." The MP's view was that moderate colleagues shouldn't just bang on about the threat of deselections but promote a more positive agenda that might appeal to enthusiastic new members who find Jeremy Corbyn's leadership inspiring - but aren't fully signed up to following a line from Momentum. "If we fight the leadership in the same way as before we will get the same result." So they are hopeful that with a more inclusive and less confrontational approach, at least some moderate candidates will get elected to the party's ruling body next year. But right now Jeremy Corbyn has a National Executive Committee that has never been more supportive of him. And even if his review of party democracy doesn't extend to turfing out MPs, it could make a significant difference to how the party organises itself. Up for discussion in the third phase of the review - later this year - is the question of how the party elects its next leader. The elevation of three Momentum-backed candidates to the NEC makes it more likely that MPs' influence in the process is further diminished and someone who shares the current leader's politics succeeds him. As part of the review, the Labour First group - which sees itself as moderate and opposes Momentum - has called for the reintroduction of an 'electoral college', which hands more influence back to elected politicians, but this seems unlikely to be successful given their weakened position on Labour's ruling body. But while there is likely to be more press scrutiny than ever before of Labour's internal structures - and while Jon Lansman's NEC victory is symbolic of a political shift within the party - in many ways Labour's tectonic plates have already moved. The big political earthquake was, of course, Jeremy Corbyn's initial election victory. But a series of moves that haven't registered as highly on the political Richter scale are also significant. He has shifted policy so that even the former Blairite minister Lord Falconer can declare "we are an anti-austerity party". The unexpectedly good showing in the general election has been taken as an endorsement of policies to extend public ownership. The Carillion collapse has helped make the case for bringing PFI and other contracts back in-house. Privately I know Labour MPs who worry about the effect this might have on public borrowing. Publicly, they remain silent. And that biting of tongues suggests that it might be an unnecessary distraction for activists to try to deselect MPs. Many may not actively assent to key aspects of the party leadership's developing policy platform - but they are not risking dissent either.\1.381264567375183,-0.01985017955303192,-0.8327142596244812,0.13162963092327118,0.9315760731697083,-0.11717440187931061,1.108699917793274,-0.020893806591629982,-0.4801762104034424,-0.6908488869667053,1.9825440645217896,0.05010771378874779,-0.855736255645752,1.8124290704727173,-2.421046018600464,-0.050854749977588654,-0.48360520601272583,0.9636909365653992,-0.08955644071102142,-1.2704064846038818,0.4798804521560669,-0.6367352604866028,-0.9001293182373047,-0.29369327425956726,-1.1159937381744385,1.1315099000930786,1.2917418479919434,-1.0195130109786987,-0.45043787360191345,-0.6908396482467651,-0.049557752907276154,1.0276005268096924,0.4483318328857422,0.5892220139503479,0.29851654171943665,0.4027021825313568,-1.7418241500854492,-0.10057222098112106,-0.1874336451292038,-1.319136142730713,-1.2299327850341797,-2.8533246517181396,-0.31878662109375,-0.7774254679679871,0.09303005784749985,0.7076282501220703,0.776393473148346,0.7285561561584473,-0.441898912191391,-0.3729041516780853,1.0900728702545166,-1.3509371280670166,-0.1057327464222908,-0.1033022403717041,2.0692665576934814,-0.32146379351615906,2.4483249187469482,-0.1874050796031952,-1.3258252143859863,0.9705703258514404,-0.2825123071670532,-0.36709627509117126,1.4653444290161133,0.3944043219089508,-1.4323259592056274,1.3982797861099243,0.37562432885169983,3.2681567668914795,-0.13697843253612518,1.4368995428085327,1.0057454109191895,1.0120028257369995,-0.9706767797470093,-0.409016877412796,-0.8299582004547119,1.088713526725769,0.2942250072956085,1.2103908061981201,0.031804412603378296,-1.3105823993682861,0.76228266954422,-0.566316545009613,-2.066699504852295,1.0098729133605957,-0.43185776472091675,1.0844618082046509,0.7702628970146179,2.190098524093628,0.05186626687645912,-0.3803761601448059,-1.1756632328033447,1.3149160146713257,-2.708017349243164,1.4820928573608398,-0.9529739022254944,0.2350732386112213,0.29501286149024963,-1.8684167861938477,-2.458517551422119,-0.6923894882202148\BBC\Power shift?\2018-01-16 21:47:25.0\
1839\Politics\Construction giant Carillion is going into liquidation after its huge financial troubles finally overwhelmed it. The UK's second-largest construction company buckled under the weight of a whopping £1.5bn debt pile. Despite discussions between Carillion, its lenders and the government, no deal could be reached to save the company. The big concern is over the disruption this might cause, given Carillion holds so many government contracts - from building hospitals to managing schools. It also employs about 20,000 people in the UK and has more staff abroad. So how did the company get into such dire straits? Carillion specialises in construction, as well as facilities management and ongoing maintenance. It has worked on big private sector projects such as the Battersea Power station redevelopment and the Anfield Stadium expansion. But it is perhaps best known for being one of the largest suppliers of services to the public sector. Notably, it is part of a consortium that holds a contract to build part of the forthcoming HS2 high speed railway line, and it is the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail. It also maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence, manages nearly 900 schools and manages highways and prisons. Very. Carillion employs 43,000 staff globally, around half of them in the UK where it does most of its business. It also operates in Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean. In 2016, it had sales of £5.2bn and until July boasted a market capitalisation of almost £1bn. But since then its share price has plummeted, leaving it worth just £61m. Some argue that it overreached itself, taking on too many risky contracts that proved unprofitable. It also faced payment delays in the Middle East that hit its accounts. Last year, it issued three profit warnings in five months and wrote down more than £1bn from the value of contracts. This made it much harder to manage its mountainous £900m debt pile and £600m pension deficit. In December, the firm convinced lenders to give it more time to repay them. However, the company's banks, which include Santander UK, HSBC and Barclays, were reluctant to lend it any more cash. Among its biggest problems were cost overruns on three public sector construction contracts: As Carillion is such a big supplier to the public sector, some fear there will be a lot of disruption. Labour MP Jon Trickett told Parliament before the announcement that if it went under, it would risk "massive damage" to a range of public services. Thousands of jobs also hang in the balance. Unions have said workers do not deserve to be caught in the crossfire and have urged the government to safeguard their jobs and bring Carillion's contracts back in house. The government, which has praised Carillion's work on projects such as Crossrail, has said it will provide funding to maintain the public services run by the firm. Analysts say Carillion had a large order book of business lined up. The big question is, who will ultimately pick up its loss-making public contracts - another outsourced services provider or the government itself?\-0.3739186227321625,-0.663856029510498,-0.8361074924468994,-0.6258752346038818,0.506054162979126,0.178617924451828,-0.08177418261766434,0.16328440606594086,-1.0299804210662842,-0.358916699886322,-0.02290407195687294,0.8692505955696106,-0.2340717315673828,-1.276004433631897,-0.09849026799201965,-0.08657541126012802,-0.31598496437072754,0.4763031005859375,0.5100048780441284,-0.11829846352338791,-0.09386537224054337,-0.2237466424703598,-0.2809154987335205,-0.9926089644432068,1.104143738746643,1.316678524017334,1.1156232357025146,-0.42612922191619873,0.8469388484954834,0.7973386645317078,-0.8418408036231995,0.5777091979980469,0.013223771005868912,-0.33562254905700684,0.10206425935029984,-0.6523324847221375,-0.2757163345813751,0.1987539529800415,0.6714611649513245,-0.10559766739606857,-0.08880595117807388,-0.7357633709907532,0.20923689007759094,-0.21708543598651886,-0.9239568710327148,0.35835540294647217,0.5836895704269409,0.49239811301231384,-1.1423842906951904,0.17304062843322754,0.4927648901939392,0.046622805297374725,-0.2274717390537262,-0.10791901499032974,-0.08410578966140747,0.1866336464881897,0.5919992923736572,-0.933149516582489,-0.5832023620605469,1.2462822198867798,-0.4564956724643707,-0.5094521045684814,0.345747172832489,0.7898525595664978,-1.1318209171295166,-0.7911268472671509,0.03397895395755768,0.7616385817527771,-1.0466525554656982,-0.3669656813144684,-0.9591886401176453,0.4819158613681793,-0.3524065315723419,-0.24361702799797058,-0.8914741277694702,-0.4136120676994324,-0.3626399040222168,-0.9094203114509583,-1.4080418348312378,-0.7125124335289001,-1.396239995956421,-1.0026572942733765,-0.40320247411727905,0.8714136481285095,0.24301815032958984,0.7749190330505371,-0.08309385180473328,0.21974599361419678,0.11740785092115402,0.8547624349594116,0.17379099130630493,-0.4030420780181885,-0.36223259568214417,0.8260582089424133,0.4599597454071045,0.045064106583595276,1.119898796081543,0.03157960996031761,-1.224012017250061,0.34709107875823975\BBC\Carillion's woes\2018-01-15 10:52:40.0\1769, 1832, 1839
1840\Politics\Residents of Hawaii are reeling from the shock of a false ballistic missile alarm, after a government employee "pushed the wrong button". But how would UK citizens be made aware of an incoming strike? Analysts agree a ballistic missile attack on the UK is highly unlikely. North Korea's nascent missile technology has nowhere near the range or reliability to hit European shores. Nevertheless, Sweden is reportedly preparing hundreds of nuclear war shelters in case of a potential attack from Russia, while countries around the world have a range of advice for survival in such a scenario and many carry out drills. In the event of such an attack being launched, would newsflashes be our only way of knowing? And with a few minutes' warning, what would British advice be? As things stand, the UK doesn't appear to have a text message warning system in place specifically for this purpose. The Cabinet Office announced in 2013 that a system to send emergency alerts to mobile phones within areas affected by flooding, industrial accidents or "other local risks" would be tested. And in a government pilot, as many as 50,000 people received a message marked as a test. But mobile phone companies say nothing has been agreed yet. A spokesman for EE told the BBC News website the UK government was "working with the mobile industry to put this capability in place". And a source at another major UK mobile phone company said: "The government are looking at text alerts but not for anything potentially incoming from North Korea. "The technology is there and it's relatively easy to do, but the government are considering it more in terms of floods." The project is being overseen by the Cabinet Office's Civil Contingencies Secretariat. A spokesman said: "The UK has robust emergency management arrangements and is designed to be flexible, adaptable and applicable to a range of emergency scenarios. "These include the capability to warn and inform the public through a range of channels including social and broadcast media platforms and direct alert such as the flood warning system. We continue to keep these arrangements under review." But what else has Britain got? Some World War II air raid sirens were retained during the Cold War to broadcast the chilling "four-minute warning" that never came. But after the Berlin Wall fell, that network was dismantled. Although the UK does have a few warning sirens left, they are largely found around chemical plants, oil refineries and flood areas. That would leave old-fashioned news flashes as the primary warning - albeit hastened to the public consciousness by smart phones and social media. In 2016, the BBC revealed the so-called "War Book" it drew up during the Cold War, containing detailed plans for broadcasting in the event of a nuclear strike. The corporation would have operated from 11 bunkers across the UK, with studios manned by staff from local radio stations. The codeword for authorising a national warning was "Falsetto". Peter Donaldson, the late Radio 4 newsreader, pre-recorded an announcement. It began: "This is the Wartime Broadcasting Service. This country has been attacked with nuclear weapons. "Communications have been severely disrupted, and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known. We shall bring you further information as soon as possible. "Meanwhile, stay tuned to this wavelength, stay calm and stay in your own homes." Citizens were advised not to go outside "under any circumstances" as roofs and walls provided protection against radioactive fallout. They were told to turn off gas supplies and fill containers with water because the mains supply might not be available for long. To conserve water, toilets were not to be flushed. It was advised that fresh food should be eaten before tinned food and it should also be rationed, as it might have to last 14 days or more. The use of a well-known presenter for the message was considered crucial because an "unfamiliar voice" would lead listeners to conclude that "perhaps the BBC has been obliterated". Current broadcasting arrangements in such a scenario are not public knowledge. The Hawaiian alert was sent on Saturday morning by an emergency system worker. Residents spoke of hysteria and panicked evacuations. There was no correction sent by text for 38 minutes, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. That was because the alert system did not allow for a correction to be sent quickly to mobiles - something the Cabinet Office might want to consider as it rolls out the UK's own capability. Two people are also now required to sign off the issuing of an alert, Hawaiian authorities said.\1.4944359064102173,0.15534046292304993,-0.41315025091171265,-0.27404484152793884,-0.36868607997894287,-0.23123694956302643,0.8959779143333435,-0.5853874087333679,-0.4809253513813019,0.4181134104728699,-0.4880732595920563,0.8631303906440735,-0.027650514617562294,0.8305385112762451,-1.0995233058929443,-1.2520620822906494,-0.2970678508281708,0.6841994524002075,-0.6270379424095154,0.14580491185188293,0.005408160854130983,0.1395094096660614,-1.039849877357483,0.39686909317970276,-0.43523481488227844,1.2624523639678955,1.3068561553955078,-0.0021029755007475615,0.005221733823418617,0.40851065516471863,0.6551148295402527,-0.33352696895599365,-0.7936405539512634,0.2445739060640335,0.24077560007572174,-0.6961476802825928,0.006164847873151302,0.7917394042015076,0.5830909609794617,-0.6576230525970459,-1.2691442966461182,-0.008385365828871727,0.8358908891677856,0.48711469769477844,-0.7594412565231323,0.7943106889724731,0.9415302276611328,0.4872948229312897,-1.7983471155166626,-0.4083683490753174,0.845970630645752,0.25286421179771423,1.0355809926986694,0.26728829741477966,-0.4842633008956909,-1.5870109796524048,1.0983078479766846,0.3832128047943115,-0.13074959814548492,0.8057476282119751,-0.6593876481056213,0.5959032773971558,0.6042140126228333,-0.9416042566299438,-0.7033769488334656,-0.48833513259887695,1.75149405002594,1.3032704591751099,-1.3610485792160034,1.8896304368972778,0.42192542552948,0.4579997956752777,-1.2765311002731323,1.1447925567626953,-0.24701841175556183,0.7298345565795898,-0.11091052740812302,0.854418158531189,-0.9367457032203674,-1.4310340881347656,-0.22411014139652252,0.8206999897956848,-0.6180383563041687,0.47740787267684937,0.7843843698501587,0.0603238083422184,0.3018869459629059,0.3623840808868408,0.7937893867492676,1.0438003540039062,-0.7887267470359802,0.8803987503051758,-1.4560633897781372,0.9719971418380737,-0.3369280993938446,0.12549836933612823,-0.41376885771751404,-0.6815317273139954,-0.2537965774536133,0.6953502297401428\BBC\Warning system?\2018-01-14 23:25:50.0\1781, 1840
1841\Politics\Fines could be imposed on people - without them being taken to court - if their rubbish ends up in an illegal tip, under a proposed new law. The measure is being suggested as part of a government consultation to tackle fly-tipping in England and Wales. Under the plans, households could be hit with a £400 maximum penalty for failing to take "reasonable measures" to ensure rubbish isn't being taken away by an "unauthorised person". The move is meant to encourage people to check the Environment Agency (or Natural Resources Wales) online register to learn whether the person taking away their household rubbish is registered to do so. Even though it's already illegal to allow an unauthorised person to remove domestic waste, issuing fixed penalties would be an alternative to going to court - which could save local authorities money in the long run. Reality Check asked the government how many people have been previously prosecuted for this offence. We were told a breakdown of the different types of offences was not available. Fly-tipping, as defined by the House of Commons Library, is "the illegal disposal of household, industrial, commercial or other 'controlled' waste without a waste management licence". On the face of it, it's getting worse. In the last financial year (April 2016 - March 2017) there were one million fly-tipping incidents in England - the equivalent of nearly 114 every hour, That represents a 7% increase from the previous year and the fourth year in a row that fly-tipping has increased. In Wales a similar trend was recorded. Local authorities reported 38,614 fly-tipping incidents, an increase of 6% on the previous year. Not only is the number of incidents rising, but the number of prosecutions in England has fallen to a record low. There were 1,571 fly-tipping prosecutions brought by English councils in 2016-17 - a significant decrease of 25% from the previous year. But the prosecution data doesn't tell the full story. Since May 2016, councils in England have been able to issue separate fines of up to £400 for small scale fly-tipping offences. In the 12 months after being given the new power, 56,000 fixed penalties were given out. That's an increase of 56% from the previous year (when 36,000 were issued). That means that for every one prosecution, 36 fixed penalty notices were issued. But what's behind the increase in fly-tipping in the first place? Unfortunately, that's a much harder question to answer. According to the National Fly-Tipping Prevention Group, financial gains (or savings) are the main motivations for fly-tipping. Others factors include "laziness and an attitude that someone else will clear up the waste". Prof Simin Davoudi, an expert in environmental policy at Newcastle University, says a lack of local facilities and the cost of getting bulky items legally collected are to blame. "A good example is Nottingham City Council," she said. "They have shown that fly-tipping can be reduced if local authorities collect some of these items free of charge. They introduced free collection and they have reduced fly-tipping in the city by nearly 42%." But the Local Government Association, which represents councils, told Reality Check there was "no evidence" to link charging with an increase in fly-tipping. The government says the apparent increase in fly-tipping over recent years may, in part, be because of more incidents being reported by local authorities as a result of new online reporting methods.

1842\Politics\Conservatism and conservation are "natural allies", Prime Minster Theresa May has said, praising her party's "proud heritage" of protecting the environment. She pointed to the 1956 Clean Air Act to tackle smog in London and Margaret Thatcher's early warnings about the dangers of global warming. But more recently, have the Tories been blowing hot and cold about the green agenda? David Cameron championed the environment as a key issue for his party when he took over as leader in 2005. "Vote Blue, go Green" he urged voters the following year in local elections, promising a "green revolution" under the Tories, who were to get a new logo in the form of a scribbled tree. Mr Cameron memorably went to the Arctic to see first-hand the effects of climate change and to be pictured on a dog-driven sled. "Hug a husky" - as the episode came to be known - became one of the defining images representing his attempts to modernise and rebrand the Conservative Party to broaden its appeal. The Conservatives went into the 2010 election promising to be the greenest government in history. There were pledges to reduce emissions, to promote low carbon technology, to conserve natural habitats and an offer of a so-called Green Deal to improve energy efficiency in homes. But once in power, in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, critics say, David Cameron's enthusiasm for the green agenda began to wane, and some questioned his genuine commitment to the cause. The government was preoccupied with reducing the deficit and putting the brakes on public spending, and the Lib Dems took charge of the flagship announcement of the introduction of a 5p tax on plastic bags. There was also a planned sell-off of state-owned woodland in England. In 2013, it was reported that David Cameron had told Downing Street aides to "get rid of all the green crap" - referring to environmental levies on energy bills. And he backed fracking, to the dismay of green campaigners. After the 2015 election yielded a Conservative majority, the Green Deal for home insulation was scrapped and subsidies for on-shore wind farms came to an end a year earlier than initially planned. Now, Theresa May has decided that championing the environment should, once again, be one of the central themes of a Conservative government. She's promised that there will be no watering down of EU environment regulations after Brexit - and put forward a series of measures to try to rein in the use of disposable plastics. Mrs May has one of her "big beasts", Michael Gove, in charge of policy. After an unexpected return to the cabinet last summer - he's clearly making the most of an opportunity, launching a number of high-profile initiatives with savvy social media campaigns, such as a ban on ivory sales. The prime minister hopes the strategy will help her win over young voters who deserted the Conservatives at the election. But Green activists have already criticised her plans as being too vague. And Mrs May's former communications director Katy Perrior has said the 25-year environment plan launched on Thursday was originally intended to be "as boring as possible," and while the prime minister's enthusiasm for protecting the environment "may not be insincere", it is "certainly new". Cynics will accuse the government of sensing the environment could be a vote-winner and throwing its weight behind the green agenda. But, speaking at the launch, Theresa May said care for the natural world was at the core of her party's philosophy. "Making good on the promise that each new generation should be able to build a better future is a fundamental Conservative principle," she said.\0.0031545215751975775,0.5138863325119019,-0.4230867624282837,-0.8329719305038452,0.2385009378194809,0.5269037485122681,1.5677578449249268,-0.09564394503831863,-1.325080156326294,-0.4723452031612396,0.867836058139801,0.5950381755828857,0.37596991658210754,1.9818450212478638,-0.54561448097229,0.003832170506939292,-0.06401322036981583,-0.09641339629888535,-0.9740073084831238,-0.7077742218971252,0.69184809923172,-0.8246594071388245,-0.21921852231025696,0.7406876683235168,-1.2594724893569946,1.5257648229599,0.7121318578720093,-0.23970291018486023,-0.31434112787246704,0.25696131587028503,-0.32420188188552856,0.5641158819198608,-0.9298017621040344,-0.04994400963187218,0.18565736711025238,-0.1717245876789093,-1.4347994327545166,-0.19454431533813477,0.5816939473152161,-0.9996930360794067,-1.1779305934906006,-0.7869476079940796,1.1345142126083374,-0.15786918997764587,0.8565062284469604,0.009937530383467674,0.13120172917842865,0.8232467174530029,-0.7809346318244934,-0.3127308487892151,0.9990472793579102,-0.44548869132995605,-0.17552444338798523,-0.33161380887031555,0.5845520496368408,0.2006096988916397,-0.033558011054992676,-0.3433504104614258,0.12475002557039261,0.4697783589363098,-0.5688470602035522,0.009496810846030712,0.628376305103302,0.663615882396698,-0.8250323534011841,0.9697100520133972,0.4320213794708252,0.8681769967079163,0.11400845646858215,0.1357971876859665,0.15792034566402435,0.013768486678600311,-0.7945528626441956,0.30313119292259216,-0.7655942440032959,-0.418428897857666,0.875892162322998,0.36303526163101196,-0.4063302278518677,-0.9947091937065125,1.014093279838562,-0.19857926666736603,-1.0814166069030762,0.1804351657629013,-0.09723835438489914,0.7435916066169739,0.47444453835487366,0.9308739304542542,0.5935773849487305,0.3322451412677765,0.48369458317756653,0.208279088139534,-0.17577891051769257,0.7224376201629639,-1.3195457458496094,0.016413940116763115,-0.06488095223903656,-1.8161735534667969,-0.15063974261283875,-0.7797378301620483\BBC\How green are the Tories?\2018-01-11 19:15:04.0\
1843\Politics\What are the key issues facing new Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey? Esther McVey's promotion to cabinet this week was Theresa May's most controversial move. The former TV presenter is loved by some in her party but has become something of a hate figure to some of her critics, with Labour describing her promotion as "alarming". During her previous three-year tenure as a minister of state at the Department for Work and Pensions, she was a fiery defender of policy, often sent out by her equally combative boss, Iain Duncan Smith, to defend controversial benefit cuts, such as the so-called "bedroom tax". While she was often an effective media performer at a time of falling levels of unemployment, she appeared to struggle at times with details of the brief, including being reprimanded by the UK Statistics Authority for misquoting unemployment statistics. Her defeat at the 2015 general election was a prized scalp for Labour, but she returned to Parliament last summer, winning the safe Tory seat of Tatton and has quickly made it to cabinet. Her critics say she often gave the impression that she didn't understand the lives of benefit claimants - and her challenge may be to adapt her approach to get those Tory MPs who are squeamish about some of the government's welfare policies to trust and support her. The government is currently in the middle of a climbdown over its overarching welfare changes. An outcry in the autumn over the way that claimants were waiting typically six weeks without money, meaning some resorted to food banks or fell into rent arrears and other debts, convinced the chancellor in his November budget to spend £1.5bn in an effort to improve how the benefit is delivered, changes that are now being rolled out. But other challenges remain. The underlying principle of universal credit (UC) is that work should always pay, that people are always better-off taking a job or extra hours than staying on benefits. However, in 2015, cuts were made so that people will now lose more of each pound they earn than was originally intended, a marginal tax rate of 63%. For some, the current benefit system will be a greater incentive to work than UC. Many Conservatives - including Esther McVey's former boss, Mr Duncan Smith - want to see those cuts reversed. David Finch from the Resolution Foundation argues that she needs to make UC more "female-friendly" by making it more appealing to second earners in a household and single parents. There is arguably no single group of benefit claimants who feel more aggrieved at continuing welfare changes than disabled people. At the heart of many of their complaints is Pip, the benefit introduced by the Conservative-led coalition in 2013. It's designed to help with the additional costs of living with a disability or long-term health condition, which are measured using a controversial assessment that claimants undergo to determine how much their condition affects what they can do. An independent review of the benefit last year found that there was no public trust in the fairness and consistency of those decisions. An ever-growing number of decisions are being appealed against successfully, and the review called for reforms of the benefits. Some campaigners want to scrap Pip entirely. That's probably not going to happen, but they say changes are needed. For an increasing number of people, being in work is no longer an insurance policy against being poor. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, more than half of the 13.5 million people living in poverty in 2016 were in working households, a figure that's increased by over 1 million since 2010-11. A key driver has been that private sector rents have risen faster than income, but little or no increases in benefit levels have also contributed. Millions of people in work rely on benefits, such as tax credits, housing benefit or increasingly universal credit, to help make ends meet. How will a politician whose maxim could well be "work always pays" deal with the evidence of growing poverty in working households? Critics say the main sickness benefit, the replacement for incapacity benefit, has so far failed to achieve the government's goals. Devised by the Labour government in 2006, and enthusiastically embraced by the coalition from 2010, campaigners say it is in desperate need of radical change. The fitness-for-work test that claimants have to undergo has infuriated some benefit seekers, who see the system as being designed to catch them out, to prove they're not ill. From the government's point of view, the predicted fall of 1 million fewer people claiming sickness benefits hasn't happened, which consequently means the billions of pounds they thought they'd save hasn't materialised either. On top of that, mistakes in moving people on to the new benefit are likely to increase its cost by another £500m. How will Ms McVey grasp this nettle? One of the achievements of the coalition government was to persuade people to save more for their retirement. Workers signed up for the auto-enrolment pensions programme in droves, and so far the opt-out rate has been low. But what has been accomplished so far has been the easy bit. Until now, contribution rates have been small: both staff and employers contribute a minimum of 1% of salaries to pension pots. But from this April, workers will have to triple their contributions. Esther McVey's biggest challenge will be to persuade people to make those larger contributions, at a time when incomes are squeezed. As far as the state pension is concerned, one of the first questions she will face is whether she plans to help the so-called Waspi women - or Women Against State Pension Inequality. These are women born in the 1950s, who had been expecting to get a state pension at the age of 60. Some of them claim they didn't know about plans to delay their pensions until the age of 66. Reality Check: The fight over women's state pensions And then there's the question of funding the state pension. A report by the Government Actuarial Department said national insurance contributions will eventually have to rise by 5% - or £1,000 per worker.

1844\Politics\Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage suggested earlier he was coming round to the idea of a second EU referendum - what is going on? To paraphrase the old joke, there are probably two chances of a second EU referendum right now - slim chance and fat chance. Ladbrokes is currently offering odds of 5/1 on it. At 11/8 the bookmakers think it is more likely that no deal will have been agreed before Britain officially leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have ruled out a second vote, both essentially arguing that it would be seen as a catastrophic breach of trust with a public already weary of broken promises. The idea that the political establishment will just keep holding referendums until they get the result they want - or simply ignore the result if they don't like it - was a constant refrain during the Brexit campaign. It has happened before, say Brexiteers. France and the Netherlands both rejected an EU constitution in 2005 referendums, which led to the document being repackaged and adopted by both countries as the Lisbon Treaty. Ireland then rejected the Lisbon Treaty in a 2008 referendum - it was the only EU country to hold such a vote - but then accepted it in a second referendum the following year, following pressure from the rest of the EU. But sometimes the establishment gets the result it wants and still has to face another vote. The term "neverendum" was coined in the French Canadian province of Quebec, which has twice voted against independence from Canada - the first time in 1980 by a majority of 59%. the second time, in 1995, by a shade over 50%. The prime ministers at the time of the two votes were pro-Canada. The independence campaign has never stopped pushing for a third vote. The former UKIP leader has angrily denounced "Remoaners" like Tony Blair and Sir John Major for suggesting the public should be given another vote. "I think there are 17.4m people out there who voted Brexit despite being told it was the wrong thing to do and I really think it would be a big mistake if these people get pushed too far," he said on his LBC radio show in November 2016. Yet before the referendum, he freely admitted he would have kept pushing for another vote if his side lost by a narrow margin. "In a 52-48 referendum this would be unfinished business by a long way. If the remain campaign win two-thirds to one-third that ends it," he told the Daily Mirror. There is a kind of consistency here - the former UKIP chief will not be satisfied until Brexit has been resoundingly backed by the people, to "finish the whole thing off". "It may well be that Nigel would get what he wants which is a completely hard Brexit," veteran Tory Eurosceptic Bill Cash told the BBC. But he added: "I do find his position quite unconvincing and for him to be, as it were, bedfellows with the Liberal Democrats I think is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in British politics." Perhaps Mr Farage - and one-time UKIP donor Arron Banks who also now backs a second referendum - are missing the spotlight and fancy getting the Brexit band back together for one more tour. He later clarified his remarks, saying a second referendum was the "last thing" he wanted to see but the Leave side had to be ready for one, as Remainers claimed support for another vote was growing. For all the sometimes wild claims from both sides, if a second referendum was held now there is no guarantee the outcome would be any different. Polling suggests Britons are becoming increasingly sceptical about the government's handling of Brexit talks "but Leave voters for the most part have not changed their minds about their decision", pollster Sir John Curtice said this week. But - say Remainers like Tony Blair - why should the 2016 referendum be the final word? That's not how democracy works, they argue. Mr Blair said in a BBC interview that people should be given a chance to "think again" once they have seen the final exit deal. He was a bit vague on how this might happen, suggesting it could be via another referendum or a general election, although this, he claimed, was a "second order" issue. Only the Liberal Democrats, with 12 MPs, are openly pushing for a second referendum. Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. The next scheduled general election is on 5 May 2022. It would take a change of Labour and/or Tory leadership, not to mention a major policy shift, and, in all likelihood, an early general election. So if there was to be another vote it would probably have to be held this year or, at the very latest, early next year. The June 2016 question was simple: "Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?" The next one, if it is ever posed, might be a bit more convoluted...\0.9532843232154846,-0.023370709270238876,0.15671145915985107,-0.933113157749176,0.21024158596992493,0.3874761462211609,0.19177240133285522,-0.36519134044647217,-0.7274581789970398,-1.2122634649276733,2.2236435413360596,0.7554874420166016,-0.8285824060440063,1.035980224609375,-0.8987522721290588,0.664280116558075,0.626020073890686,0.7821592092514038,0.3736066222190857,-0.15051306784152985,0.28756648302078247,-0.34850674867630005,-0.04876389726996422,-0.5964639782905579,-0.6880200505256653,0.5066574811935425,-0.7158878445625305,0.6876946091651917,-0.7228670120239258,0.9017966389656067,-0.6345804333686829,-0.33435681462287903,0.6354414820671082,0.29695984721183777,0.04568614065647125,-0.1032085120677948,-0.7790946364402771,0.8219623565673828,-0.23294886946678162,-0.9160471558570862,0.040016040205955505,-0.6444547772407532,1.3129973411560059,0.6721615791320801,0.15975715219974518,0.10444694012403488,1.0010144710540771,2.239611864089966,-2.1805057525634766,-0.6434701085090637,1.1213514804840088,-1.7032159566879272,-0.4025135338306427,0.20600385963916779,1.7433443069458008,-0.5672092437744141,2.176619291305542,0.5755388736724854,-1.3529059886932373,-0.7338430285453796,0.6670659780502319,0.9003522992134094,-0.750775158405304,-0.01068183220922947,-1.3189527988433838,1.470015048980713,1.6021138429641724,1.0225011110305786,-0.2535393536090851,1.1232097148895264,1.3184380531311035,-0.42128029465675354,-0.9083840250968933,1.2280638217926025,0.30351731181144714,-0.9780355095863342,-0.4960300028324127,0.9458669424057007,-0.6586583852767944,-0.9435178637504578,0.13354870676994324,-0.8227362632751465,-1.3159996271133423,-0.44391873478889465,0.23620206117630005,-0.8604374527931213,0.9002535343170166,0.2574540376663208,-0.38461029529571533,0.40259966254234314,-0.10464806854724884,0.8137101531028748,-0.7240049839019775,-0.4047568142414093,0.7491464018821716,1.0002572536468506,-1.0707731246948242,-0.16301597654819489,-0.25259992480278015,-0.31160303950309753\BBC\Farage's about turn?\2018-01-11 18:55:52.0\
1845\Politics\Brexit campaigners have given EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier a hamper of British products during a meeting at the European Commission in Brussels. The delegation was made up of the Euro MP Steven Woolfe, Lord Jones, the chair of the Leave Means Leave campaign John Longworth and Labour donor John Mills. The hamper included the complete works of Shakespeare, cheddar cheese, marmite, PG Tips and some English wine. Lord Jones said the aim was to show the UK had little to fear from no deal. The hamper also included: "It shows that we have great products that can still be sold in Europe but we are also going to expand," said former UKIP member Mr Woolfe. Lord Jones said he did not expect Mr Barnier to eat the items, although Mr Barnier's advisor Stefaan De Rynck, said it was well received: The gift has prompted Twitter users to complain that it contained few products from Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Some highlighted that the products were made with Spanish oranges or had been invented abroad. One pointed out that the Anglo-Dutch owner of Marmite, Unilever, had predicted that Brexit would have a negative effect on its business. Another hoped the negotiations would not be, ahem, hampered. Mr Barnier already has a groaning gift shelf. At the first round of talks he was presented with a vintage climbing book by Brexit Secretary David Davis. He gave his British guest an antique walking stick. Jeremy Corbyn brought Mr Barnier a personalised Arsenal football shirt. The Labour leader received a retro railway poster from Mr Barnier's home region in France. It is all designed to build trust and generate bonhomie. Or in this case to also generate some publicity for a fairly run-of-the-mill meeting. But it rounds off a bumper week for diplomatic gifts, after the French President Emmanuel Macron gave the Chinese President an eight-year-old horse. The anti-Brexit Open Britain campaign was not impressed with the Brexiteers' gift to Mr Barnier, however. The group's deputy director Francis Grove-White said: "We have reached peak Brexit. Self-important charlatans marching around Brussels with hampers of quintessentially British products, many of which are owned by companies that have said they are deeply worried about the impact of Brexit, does nothing to further the national interest."\1.3737540245056152,0.3762761652469635,-0.681840181350708,0.009165859781205654,-0.11980672925710678,-0.5043233633041382,0.8795892596244812,-0.057879041880369186,-0.23614446818828583,-1.067535161972046,0.8037757873535156,0.4946817457675934,0.08769175410270691,0.15508396923542023,-0.2972460091114044,-0.789851725101471,-0.3474704921245575,0.5730222463607788,0.6778528094291687,0.1575450599193573,0.6375907063484192,-0.3147720992565155,-0.8115420937538147,-0.5030027627944946,-0.8783525824546814,0.2943395674228668,0.9577067494392395,0.03939538076519966,0.7329500913619995,-0.5575918555259705,0.7828368544578552,0.3986397683620453,-0.532046914100647,0.05970461294054985,-0.1942574828863144,-0.5670974254608154,-0.021752547472715378,0.23358386754989624,-0.6665175557136536,-0.056052301079034805,-0.37498655915260315,-0.4785754382610321,0.23443229496479034,-0.06974124163389206,0.04653305932879448,-0.10255894064903259,0.32865089178085327,-0.5852497816085815,-0.7234553098678589,0.0495571605861187,-0.12881210446357727,0.165887713432312,0.41136452555656433,0.49249592423439026,0.8141366839408875,-0.7595786452293396,0.18095168471336365,-0.15747450292110443,-0.7697056531906128,0.3241123855113983,0.5123345851898193,-0.25211501121520996,-0.5328949689865112,-0.2481752634048462,-0.35628655552864075,0.6760904788970947,0.07171440124511719,1.599010705947876,-1.4977458715438843,0.6141826510429382,0.7348026633262634,0.0410708524286747,-0.7518082857131958,-0.27201855182647705,0.43987205624580383,0.5710697770118713,0.33896276354789734,-0.8278349041938782,-0.3570981025695801,-0.8404250741004944,0.87233966588974,0.19625036418437958,-0.09725698828697205,-0.10952375084161758,0.562740683555603,-0.01754377968609333,0.2704451084136963,0.5303027629852295,0.40133246779441833,-0.13829393684864044,-0.3675183653831482,0.2891967296600342,-0.5942692756652832,0.04676778241991997,0.09928758442401886,0.023302875459194183,0.07981006056070328,-1.0829591751098633,0.15459413826465607,0.37086203694343567\BBC\Tempting treats\2018-01-10 18:09:27.0\
1846\Politics\There were big differences in the responses of universities to the controversial letter asking for details of Brexit teaching sent to them in October by the government whip, Chris Heaton-Harris. While some denounced it as "sinister" and having the "whiff of McCarthyism", others were very happy to send the information Mr Heaton-Harris was seeking, and invited him to be a guest speaker or to get involved in their initiatives. When the letter was publicised it was denounced as political interference in academic freedom by numerous academics and politicians. Lord Patten, the chancellor of Oxford University, described it as "offensive and idiotic Leninism". But BBC research now reveals there was a much more mixed response in reality, with university reactions ranging from anger to enthusiasm. This is disclosed by a BBC freedom of information request, asking UK universities for a copy of their response to the letter. Mr Heaton-Harris, a staunch Eurosceptic and the third most senior government whip, wrote to most university vice-chancellors in early October asking for "the names of professors at your establishment who are involved in the teaching of European affairs, with particular reference to Brexit". He also requested "a copy of the syllabus and links to the online lectures which relate to this area". Of 59 universities that responded to Mr Heaton-Harris's letter, 28 were cooperative, providing Mr Heaton-Harris with most or all of what he asked for. Many universities sent online links to course modules and lists of the relevant academic staff who taught topics which could relate to Brexit. Professor Karen Cox at the University of Kent went further. After supplying the MP with online links to staff lists and course outlines, she asked for a favour in return - for Mr Heaton-Harris to be a guest speaker for a new Masters level module on European Affairs. The Dean for the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities at the University of Westminster, Andrew Linn, similarly sent links to staff research expertise and course content, and also extended an invitation for the MP to come to a debate hosted by the university on Brexit. A colleague of the Dean at the university asked in a separate email "If you have ideas/initiatives where you may want to involve us and students, please keep in touch... we also organise student trips to the Parliament and it would be good for them to meet and interact with you in the future." Other institutions who gave full responses about their work included the University of Sheffield, which provided a list of relevant staff and descriptions of the modules available that related to Brexit. The President of City University, Sir Paul Curran, similarly supplied the names and contact details of two senior academics who he said would "both be pleased to be contacted" by the MP's office for further information. In contrast 17 institutions entirely or mostly refused to provide the information asked for. The angriest responses came from the Vice-Chancellor of Worcester University, David Green - who first publicised the letter - and Bill Rammell from the University of Bedfordshire, a former Labour MP. David Green wrote: "I look forward to receiving your letter of apology for sending me this sinister letter in which you ask me to supply the 'names of professors'. I will do no such thing. If you are committed to freedom as you now claim, you will write to me by return apologising and withdrawing your damaging letter in its entirety." Bill Rammell said he shared the "deep concerns" expressed about the intentions of the request, adding: "I am not willing to share with you the names of academics teaching on the subject area of European affairs and/or Brexit, as your letter does not make it clear your purposes in asking, and I am concerned that there is a whiff of McCarthyism in the request and a desire to foment public opposition to perfectly legitimate and valuable academic activity." Several other universities gave links to basic course information but cited a mixture of academic freedom, commercial interest or staff safety as reasons to refuse most of the information sought by Mr Heaton-Harris. The universities of Royal Holloway, Northampton and Sheffield Hallam raised concerns that releasing names of staff could lead to "harassment", "threatening their safety" or "unwarranted repercussions". Another 26 institutions said they did not respond at all to the Tory MP's request. This could be a breach of freedom of information law, since universities are covered by FOI and the letter was clearly a request for information. Several universities told us that they decided to treat the letter as personal correspondence to the Vice-Chancellor and not as an FOI request. These included the universities of the West of Scotland, Brunel, Nottingham and Lincoln. The University of Surrey told us "We did not treat this request as an FOI, which in hindsight was perhaps wrong. We apologise for any misunderstanding, as we endeavour to respond to all requests under the Act in a full and timely way." Chris Heaton-Harris was approached for a response to the BBC's findings but declined to comment. At the time of the initial fuss, universities minister Jo Johnson told the BBC's Today Programme that Mr Heaton-Harris was conducting research for a book. Fourteen universities replied to tell Mr Heaton-Harris they had no information to supply, as they did not teach relevant courses. Twenty-six universities told us that they did not actually receive the letter. They include Cambridge, Leeds, Birmingham, Plymouth, Exeter, UCL and Queen Mary. Fifteen of the 135 universities approached by the BBC have not responded to our FOI request.\0.4639419913291931,0.7638506293296814,-0.7633260488510132,0.15898388624191284,0.8138296008110046,0.17319613695144653,1.0655118227005005,-0.45595717430114746,-0.2629164457321167,-0.45222705602645874,-0.5292254686355591,0.6127279996871948,-1.2866005897521973,1.0004409551620483,0.302219957113266,-0.702217698097229,1.8174402713775635,-0.5402756929397583,0.2567114531993866,-0.002285158494487405,0.41376036405563354,-0.33858731389045715,-0.2765321433544159,0.46991589665412903,-0.05581073835492134,-0.4099671542644501,1.334267497062683,-0.858755886554718,0.5588854551315308,-0.930019199848175,0.9329091310501099,0.569236159324646,0.01599121280014515,-0.32608380913734436,0.8577859997749329,0.13658642768859863,0.25979527831077576,0.5791648626327515,-0.0410294383764267,-0.9439473152160645,-1.3220393657684326,-0.18315616250038147,0.31375762820243835,-0.4294885993003845,-0.6685994267463684,-0.5065175294876099,0.00711708702147007,1.2910187244415283,-1.3406693935394287,-0.2499823421239853,-0.6464534401893616,-1.7439335584640503,-0.34292393922805786,-0.6264917850494385,1.1206692457199097,-1.2289752960205078,1.4879322052001953,0.3486649692058563,-1.311612606048584,0.9210989475250244,-0.37425488233566284,-1.376725435256958,1.1148791313171387,-0.032661065459251404,-0.49813926219940186,0.22231796383857727,1.6131771802902222,2.083759307861328,-1.4567404985427856,1.2336927652359009,1.520752191543579,-1.5429260730743408,-1.4507818222045898,0.13998723030090332,-0.4820999205112457,0.2792372405529022,-0.29177427291870117,0.7949665188789368,0.4731389284133911,-1.5850756168365479,0.9102701544761658,0.17436403036117554,-0.9213573932647705,-0.8845822215080261,0.9424847960472107,-0.10390453040599823,-0.5752382278442383,0.8776774406433105,-0.9302920699119568,-0.6734403371810913,-0.9219762086868286,1.331588625907898,-1.460099458694458,0.39560645818710327,-0.5182756185531616,0.7481278777122498,0.09341370314359665,-1.3947645425796509,-1.3220000267028809,-1.261629581451416\BBC\Scholarly replies\2018-01-09 13:41:42.0\
1847\Politics\It is a year since devolved government in Northern Ireland collapsed. But how has the lack of a Northern Ireland Executive and assembly affected life there, and what do people want from the future? It seemed a little late to be talking about Christmas, but Aiden Flynn remained focused on the celebrations just passed. The managing director of a large construction company based just outside Belfast, he said he kept thinking about the 40 members of staff he had had to lay off last year. "That's 40 families who didn't have a great Christmas," he said. "And it's going to get worse, unless the assembly gets back to doing its work." The assembly he referred to was set up in Northern Ireland after the Good Friday peace agreement. It took on a host of legislative responsibilities, from economic development, to education and health. But more than anything, the assembly was supposed to bring together republicans and unionists in a project of common purpose. One year ago, however, that sense of common purpose seemed to vanish, as the republican party, Sinn Fein, walked out on the assembly, bringing about its collapse. Since then, there's been no authority to commission the kind of public sector work upon which Mr Flynn's construction company and many others in Northern Ireland depend. "I would normally get a constant stream of work: refurbishment of schools… of hospital wards. I was hopeful they'd get the assembly up and running again 11 months ago - but 12 months?" The ostensible reason for Stormont's collapse was financial: the ruling Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) was blamed for the failure of a renewable heating scheme. Demands for the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, to resign went unheeded, but that demand has now been dwarfed by a whole list of requirements issued by Sinn Fein to be met before it will return to shared power. At The Maverick, a gay and lesbian bar in Belfast, I found customers mulling over one of these: that the DUP agrees to allow same-sex marriage, still illegal in Northern Ireland. "It's great that one of the main parties is supporting equal marriage," one drinker told me. He said it might make him more likely to vote for Sinn Fein. But another was more cynical: "I can't help thinking that Sinn Fein has picked it up because it's something the DUP oppose. They're just using it as a means of contradicting them." Such political opportunism would hardly be unique, indeed it has become almost expected in an era of widespread cynicism. However, the writer Malachi O'Doherty believes there is particular reason to doubt the face-value demands of Northern Ireland's parties. Put quite simply, he sees more long-term political and sectarian divisions lurking underneath. "Sinn Fein and the DUP have locked horns like old rams familiar with the struggle with each other," he says. "We've been through a period where we had some optimism divisions would be dispelled. "Now, the more contempt you express for the other side, the more votes you will get." Not so, insists Simon Hamilton, a DUP member of the legislative assembly. He says: "We want to see the institutions up and running again immediately, but Sinn Fein have developed a fairly lengthy shopping list of demands." He mentions the call for an Irish language act, which would give Irish heightened official status in Northern Ireland. Mr Hamilton worries this will lead to fluency in Irish becoming a requirement for some official jobs. Moreover, he says, if Sinn Fein wants a language act, equal marriage, or any other measure, it should agree to re-establish the assembly, and then use it as a forum to press its demands. But Mairtin O Muilleoir is not in a mood to go back without guarantees. A Sinn Fein member of the legislative assembly, he dismisses its previous incarnation as being "founded on arrogance and disrespect". The late Martin McGuiness, then Deputy First Minister, was right to bring the assembly down, Mr O Muilleoir says. And he insists that same-sex marriage and enhanced Irish language status are fundamental to Sinn Fein's politics, adding: "Republicanism was founded on the basis of equality for all." It is exactly the kind of political-historic discussion that leaves Dr John Woods looking weary. Dr Woods chairs the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland, where four of the five health trusts are among the 10 worst emergency department performers in the UK. Yet plans for local NHS provision are now gathering dust, with no assembly to implement them. "We very definitely want the assembly up and running… to take the necessary decisions," Dr Woods says. "In the absence of that, we will simply carry on with a system that is failing." This week sees a new Northern Ireland secretary appointed. The previous one, James Brokenshire, had to set a budget for Northern Ireland, in the absence of an elected assembly. But his replacement, Karen Bradley, may yet impose full direct rule from Westminster, if power sharing cannot be restored. And the assembly's headquarters at Stormont will become an over-sized, underused monument to thwarted hopes of the recent past.\-0.005736471153795719,-0.31224629282951355,-1.2261230945587158,0.8233552575111389,-0.3000084161758423,0.8316236734390259,1.7593477964401245,0.17711810767650604,-0.6757779121398926,-1.0958261489868164,0.5896025896072388,1.004101037979126,0.15275226533412933,1.0272142887115479,-1.8695764541625977,0.20634925365447998,-0.4096354842185974,-0.22279153764247894,-0.9652856588363647,-0.16859255731105804,0.6277689337730408,-1.070367455482483,-0.6144761443138123,0.3804633915424347,-0.902215838432312,0.8878921270370483,1.4853663444519043,0.09098853170871735,-0.6824254393577576,-0.21680890023708344,0.34744811058044434,0.9322459697723389,-0.5661356449127197,-0.43566465377807617,-0.19909638166427612,-0.25136154890060425,0.01769999973475933,0.23267409205436707,0.5590409636497498,-0.4860087037086487,-0.30093029141426086,-0.18419866263866425,0.42844724655151367,0.1187710389494896,-0.5687565803527832,-0.017482886090874672,-0.2047813981771469,0.5748758316040039,-1.0493780374526978,-0.15113332867622375,1.4997837543487549,-0.6406379342079163,-0.8870454430580139,0.2762202322483063,1.6487748622894287,0.05578850209712982,1.378135323524475,0.0416601225733757,-0.3751165270805359,0.7759684920310974,-0.20705237984657288,-0.016162702813744545,-0.9025028944015503,-0.38697683811187744,-0.6059011816978455,1.0341453552246094,0.10426593571901321,1.0656676292419434,-0.6670117974281311,1.5575039386749268,0.16995513439178467,0.9218477606773376,-0.19097702205181122,0.9308470487594604,-1.336672067642212,0.500292956829071,0.32074809074401855,-0.11430652439594269,0.1106291264295578,-0.46391788125038147,0.5170676112174988,-0.16663199663162231,-1.4375754594802856,0.19535024464130402,0.23270852863788605,-0.058819182217121124,1.188181757926941,0.45856791734695435,0.035363804548978806,-0.22224169969558716,-0.9836816787719727,1.3648815155029297,-1.6473350524902344,-0.0188568364828825,-0.3144676983356476,0.23200950026512146,0.08869307488203049,-0.9473586678504944,-1.2656810283660889,-0.21218803524971008\BBC\Who's in charge?\2018-01-09 02:27:14.0\
1848\Politics\Here is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have now agreed on the three "divorce" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year "transition" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting. England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail. Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that "Brexit means Brexit" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party. You can get more detail on the 2017 election here. David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - and remains around 10% lower against the dollar and 15% down against the euro. But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy has continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session: The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks have been trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called "divorce bill", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. Agreement on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a "transition" period and future relations between the UK and the EU. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a "single market" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works. Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU. It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law. The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This "Great Repeal Bill", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill. Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years. Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably "softer" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term. These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit. So at one extreme, "hard" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a "soft" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together. The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a "level playing field". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels. Read more: A free trade area v EU single market The customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals. It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals. The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role. Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators. The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a "transition" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums. The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a "cliff-edge" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy. As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations. Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers. There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could mean The agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure. The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU. Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a "transition" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals. People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years. Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a "sustainable" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration? It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a "take it or leave it" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel. If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU. Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was "democratically unacceptable" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process. The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave. Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a "hard border" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky. What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland border There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves. There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn. The UK could leave without any Brexit "divorce bill" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically. During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called "triple lock" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed. There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money. Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an "upside" or "silver lining" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the "customs union" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued. If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work. After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached. Read more here Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory. The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave. Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions. The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process. The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the "direct" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019. After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements. The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out. The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations. Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is "free movement", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of "ever closer union" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a "United States of Europe". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain "special" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference. Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany. Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone. Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - "much to France's chagrin", she says. Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products. Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this page The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version. In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece. The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check. David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS. The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats. The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his "emergency brake" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: "All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC." The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations. The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies. Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU." So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017. Ged, from Liverpool, suspects "red tape" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list. Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate "red tape" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries. Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US. Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim. Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as "scaremongering" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer). The BBC's Kevin Connolly says: The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal. So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says: The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says: At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response. But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future. Kevin Connolly says: Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate. The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction. The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members. It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here. Kevin Connolly says: As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well. After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity. For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners. The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules. At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%. But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers. The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis. So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient. Maybe very, very patient. Norman Smith says: There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU. View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force. View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage. My take is that not much is probably going to change. I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French. The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country. Kevin Connolly says: Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave. But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades. Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership. As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go. But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door. As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area. Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals. But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself. Kevin Connolly says: I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot. Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory. In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs. On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was "a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back". But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to. The situation with Ireland's border is more complex. For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back. But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union. Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border. And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options. Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine. Kevin Connolly says: Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU. It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities. The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place. If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live. For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card. If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card. The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status. So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK. Norman Smith says: If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK. So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions. There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years. Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, "I paid in there", and that will count. That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements. Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements. If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension. Kevin Connolly says: I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself. Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports. Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports. The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time. Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers. All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future. Norman Smith says: I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this. But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it. And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice. However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol. I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going. So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders. Kevin Connolly says: This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words "European Union" on the front cover. Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about. But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait. The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK. Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals? Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements. Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019? Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then. Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit? The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations. How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law? Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law. I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit? You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations. I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change? Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK.

1849\Politics\Autumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's. The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined. The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines. If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45. "I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn," the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful. It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: "Building a country that works or everyon." The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit. It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online. In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to "let the British lion roar". Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of "emerging plots" among some MPs. Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was "on the threshold of power". The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the "political mainstream" because its polices were "what most people in our country actually want". He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government "hanging by a thread". His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting "Oh, Jeremy Corbyn" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully. And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will "always make the case for independence" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters. Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue. The "essence of independence", she told activists, was being "in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit. Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021. She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at "close to cost price as possible". Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be "truly transformational", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August. The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight. In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of "hope and realism". He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality. And he claimed Brexit would be an act of "masochism", leaving the UK poorer. UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned. The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: "Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line." Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won. UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall. Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the "hurt" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved. While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking. Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the "little guy" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in "community bonds". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019. Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a "rail revolution". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting.\0.4538763165473938,0.07187037169933319,-0.09370595216751099,-0.05888182669878006,1.1514643430709839,-0.019683141261339188,1.2759896516799927,-0.20050223171710968,-1.3252633810043335,-0.665596604347229,-0.38261550664901733,0.6861246824264526,-0.9883843660354614,1.7849376201629639,-1.903757095336914,0.22277750074863434,-0.11887471377849579,1.0122884511947632,-0.9692508578300476,-0.02934369631111622,0.08862905204296112,-1.352144479751587,-1.0007113218307495,0.6376798152923584,-1.517381191253662,0.5756489634513855,0.9579915404319763,0.9337245225906372,0.5710336565971375,-0.3009689152240753,-0.20164786279201508,0.3059357702732086,0.26270562410354614,0.9143214225769043,-0.2820090055465698,0.5896437168121338,-0.7078501582145691,0.5625011920928955,-0.24893534183502197,-1.2323088645935059,-1.2805956602096558,-0.46114617586135864,0.4194730520248413,-1.7471003532409668,-0.23912827670574188,-0.04300711303949356,0.5111333131790161,1.3900223970413208,-0.4914052486419678,0.14014072716236115,0.39333438873291016,-1.0861175060272217,0.4276549220085144,-0.2726840376853943,1.3659056425094604,0.18280334770679474,1.0127358436584473,-0.5112167596817017,-0.7049099802970886,1.0303457975387573,0.0232484620064497,-0.006563230883330107,1.0455385446548462,0.2631760835647583,-0.15044187009334564,1.896301031112671,0.5411641001701355,1.247063159942627,0.017844093963503838,0.9206655621528625,0.7163252234458923,-0.3035922944545746,-0.2740808129310608,-0.38006675243377686,-2.1902263164520264,-0.2118806689977646,0.282937616109848,-0.24088305234909058,-0.1305573582649231,-0.291856586933136,1.2617301940917969,-0.6066215634346008,-1.5674688816070557,0.8109880685806274,0.6757583022117615,0.4586123526096344,-0.02327941730618477,0.6996780037879944,-0.22326704859733582,-0.21094880998134613,1.054726243019104,0.2780582904815674,-2.15529465675354,0.06519853323698044,0.4458993971347809,0.49784332513809204,-0.3410038352012634,-0.6260533928871155,-0.7097113132476807,0.4713387191295624\BBC\Party conferences 2017\2017-10-24 18:16:23.0\
1850\Technology\"There's not an area of my life it hasn't touched," says Chrissy Chambers, reflecting on the secret sex tape her ex-boyfriend posted online. "It has affected my life in every way imaginable and I'm sure it will continue to for the rest of my life." During her four-year legal battle against the man - who cannot be named for legal reasons - Ms Chambers went from YouTube musician to "revenge porn" campaigner. Here, she tells her story to the BBC's Jane Wakefield. JW: How did you first find out the video had been uploaded? CC: I initially found out through a friend and a fan who wrote to us and said: "I just want to alert you that someone is spreading these links." Someone was distributing links all over our YouTube channel, saying: "You think Chrissy Chambers is a role model? She's actually a whore, look at these videos." I clicked the link and then realised for the first time what had happened. I literally fell down on the ground and it felt just like I was getting hit with a baseball bat. To find out that the video existed and to find out that this had happened at all, it was like my world came crashing down. How has it affected your life? In every way imaginable. I have PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder], I became an alcoholic at 23. I almost died. I had depression, anxiety, night terrors. It affected my relationship. We [Chrissy and partner Bria Kam] had a successful YouTube channel at that point and had about 50,000 young women who were following us and looking up to us. Some of them said: "I looked up to you so much, I can't support someone who would choose to do this." It was heartbreaking for me - but knowing that I had all these other people who loved us and supported us, I felt a huge responsibility to stand up for myself and seek justice. I wanted to set an example in case this ever happened to them. You live in the United States but the videos were uploaded in the UK, so your case was fought here. What happened? My ex uploaded the videos before the [revenge porn] law was passed here in the UK. I was here in the UK the day the law passed and we went to the police to try and get criminal charges. They said the statute of limitations on my case had long passed and I was not going to be able to pursue criminal charges Then you had a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for a civil case. We raised the money in a month. The public reaction to the situation was an outpouring of of love and support - and also horror at the situation. I won monetary damages from my ex, as well as being assigned copyright to the videos. That was the most important piece of the puzzle, because if these videos are ever shared again I can now go to the websites directly and submit takedown notices or pursue legal action. We have spent four-and-a-half years fighting to get the rights to get the videos taken down. It just means everything. The money is important too. Since he got anonymity, there needed to be some reparation for the suffering and all of the therapy and things we had to go through. The real victory for me was getting justice and setting a precedent for others. Did you contact websites previously to have the videos taken down? What did they say? If websites actually responded, that would be great. When I reached out in the past I got no response. It wasn't until we sent a letter from a lawyer that some of the videos started to come down. I would like to see these websites require some proof of consent for videos uploaded, and a much better system for takedown notices. If somebody says a video was not consensual, it should come down quickly to protect the victim. You have become a figurehead for fighting revenge porn. What would you say to other victims? I would say to other victims who maybe don't have the confidence and don't know what to do about pursuing it, that I know exactly how you feel. I've been there. There are many days where I don't feel confident to keep fighting. Justice can be served. I finally learned that there was a light at the end of my tunnel. Don't give up hope. Even if it takes years you can get justice and you didn't deserve to have this happen to you.\1.4507015943527222,-0.6067498326301575,-0.5383968949317932,1.0259186029434204,-1.5920099020004272,0.8200494050979614,0.06990107148885727,-0.8105705976486206,-1.5056549310684204,-0.612030029296875,0.4566798806190491,1.248207926750183,-0.021067699417471886,0.4883964955806732,-0.5730934739112854,-0.7897236943244934,0.55316162109375,1.0548994541168213,-1.552738904953003,0.5449382066726685,-0.10093557089567184,0.2095128893852234,-0.6127671003341675,-0.033790554851293564,-0.7435557246208191,0.1986464262008667,0.9556604027748108,0.8119388222694397,0.23928487300872803,0.5156354308128357,0.5352177023887634,1.166922926902771,-0.29897788166999817,0.046215370297431946,-0.291414737701416,-0.6076921820640564,-0.08884557336568832,-0.49268242716789246,1.1313809156417847,-0.400007426738739,0.5516133308410645,-0.6690493226051331,1.0475633144378662,-0.49979168176651,0.6559116244316101,0.5281978249549866,1.0930651426315308,0.6441535949707031,-0.44791391491889954,-0.545969545841217,1.0732204914093018,-0.667362630367279,-0.6445383429527283,1.0066559314727783,0.5081409215927124,-0.43649977445602417,2.416126012802124,-0.33829599618911743,-0.3247193992137909,1.3480833768844604,-0.42478761076927185,-0.43776237964630127,0.1587403118610382,0.2951914072036743,-1.282891869544983,1.1658457517623901,0.9979802370071411,1.63906729221344,-0.335504949092865,1.5221853256225586,0.38672852516174316,-0.8391321897506714,0.0432434007525444,0.41217172145843506,-1.5852949619293213,-0.3096303641796112,-0.6059516668319702,-0.05350424721837044,-1.1481695175170898,0.09949924796819687,-0.5636841058731079,-0.1372760534286499,-1.4195719957351685,-0.43309053778648376,0.42052510380744934,0.5147531628608704,0.7236046195030212,0.3699502646923065,-0.810961127281189,0.05416565015912056,-0.4854184091091156,0.3711335062980652,-0.7628388404846191,0.31029611825942993,-1.39116632938385,-0.2680148780345917,-0.42587172985076904,-0.8758251667022705,-2.172166347503662,1.6309224367141724\BBC\Chrissy Chambers: How revenge porn almost killed me\2018-01-18 16:35:23.0\
1851\Technology\Intel says devices are rebooting more than usual after being patched with fixes it has issued to the Spectre and Meltdown security flaws in its chips. The company said it had reproduced the problem and was "making progress toward identifying the root cause". It also shared information about how the patches might affect computer performance in data centres. One financial industry expert told the BBC he was concerned about the numbers being quoted. Intel said its tests showed a reduction in performance ranging from 2% to 25%. The US company said it was working with partners and customers to find ways to "address" the issue. In an update on its website, Intel said the reboot problem had been identified in its Ivy Bridge, Sandy Bridge and Skylake processors. It also affected Kaby Lake chips - its most recent offering. Two separate security flaws, known as Meltdown and Spectre, were publicly disclosed in January. Researchers discovered gaps in security stemming from central processing units - better known as the chip or microchip - that could allow privately stored data in computers and networks to be hacked. Experts suggested fixing the problem could reduce the performance of Intel chips significantly. Intel said its "initial analysis" for business cases such as running website servers showed a slowdown of 2%. But it added that when it simulated a stock brokerage making transactions, the chips saw a 4% reduction in performance. One industry insider suggested that figure was more significant than it might seem at first glance. "In a company like ours, 4% would be a massive difference," said Alasdair Haynes from the stock exchange Aquis. "We measure the time of trades in microseconds. Firms spend an enormous amount of time and money trying to get the fastest speed out of a server." The most significant reduction in performance involved computer servers that store and retrieve large volumes of data. For those, the slowdown could be as severe as 25%.\0.03618728369474411,0.018472567200660706,-0.050725307315588,-0.233411505818367,-0.3569667637348175,0.33956238627433777,0.2358425110578537,-0.3630293011665344,-0.4157891571521759,0.37443825602531433,-0.49661585688591003,0.14847007393836975,0.12388588488101959,0.14161066710948944,-0.8107680678367615,0.011909856460988522,0.0073623573407530785,-0.38421812653541565,0.5181971192359924,-0.3990122675895691,-0.8688454627990723,-0.5086002349853516,-0.3812705874443054,-0.21084342896938324,-0.12967342138290405,0.06786800175905228,0.05953993275761604,0.8804078698158264,0.9901101589202881,0.767372727394104,-0.7678864002227783,-0.3155460059642792,0.15923647582530975,0.271575927734375,0.47504252195358276,-0.2494162768125534,-0.33681759238243103,0.19145521521568298,0.6543288230895996,0.09446146339178085,0.11577064543962479,-0.48292914032936096,0.9047349095344543,-0.47515615820884705,-0.8730731010437012,-0.27670061588287354,-0.01348792389035225,0.7620270848274231,-0.3821561634540558,0.0670461431145668,-0.8012497425079346,-0.39014118909835815,-0.9316824078559875,0.2517719864845276,0.5255609750747681,0.301627516746521,-0.330941379070282,0.23080803453922272,-0.20630323886871338,0.3420391082763672,0.38652005791664124,-0.10657220333814621,-0.13545212149620056,0.048926740884780884,-0.10326627641916275,0.6761533617973328,0.28042706847190857,1.2448543310165405,0.27588337659835815,0.002943023107945919,0.054321106523275375,-0.5546818971633911,0.3333202302455902,0.7062284350395203,0.47080644965171814,-0.7092741131782532,-0.2789557874202728,-0.5783829689025879,-0.3024721145629883,-0.008878076449036598,-0.579728901386261,-0.918738603591919,-0.17207682132720947,0.43712374567985535,0.39707526564598083,0.13220538198947906,-0.611710250377655,0.12797090411186218,0.9145395755767822,-1.046408772468567,-0.875122606754303,0.1425563246011734,0.013713838532567024,1.2228825092315674,-0.40818893909454346,0.4311063885688782,0.5932593941688538,-1.2145202159881592,-0.10489636659622192,-0.022468682378530502\BBC\Intel fix causes reboots and slowdowns\2018-01-18 13:41:17.0\
1852\Technology\A range of new concept cars has been showcased at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Concept cars are visions of how the future of motoring may look, although some experts said there were fewer models than expected. That could be because such vehicles are time-consuming and expensive to make, especially considering some will never reach the production line. Digital dashboards, green energy and autonomous features were big themes. Honda previewed the third generation Insight. Competing with the Toyota Prius and hybrid models such as the Ford Fusion, the car can travel short distances on battery power alone. Unlike some of its rivals, the Honda engine often only acts as a generator, recharging the battery to run the electric motor. While the first and second generation Insights made it to the European market, it's believed this third-gen car will not be offered in the UK. It goes on sale in the second half of 2018. In a design challenge to show what the future of SUVs (sport utility vehicles) could look like, Nissan has revealed the XMotion concept, which, according to the Japanese brand, combines Japanese culture and design with American convenience. It has seven digital screens inside and is the brainchild of Nissan's new chief designer Alfonso Albaisa. Chinese manufacturer GAC unveiled The Enverge which is built on GAC's all-new electric vehicle (EV) platform and is powered by a 71kWh battery that gives the small crossover a range of more than 370 miles. The car attracted a lot of attention at the show, with its gull-wing doors and "floating" digital dash-screen. Among its more outlandish features are the headlights, which slide out and detach to be used as floodlights. Lexus unveiled a full-sized luxury SUV concept, the LF-1 Limitless, which is designed to accept a range of engines from fuel cell, hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery electric. It also has what the car maker is calling a "four-dimensional navigation system", with the fourth dimension - time - meaning the vehicle has an intelligent assistant on-board that anticipates destinations based on the driver's schedule and other information. The Infiniti Q Inspiration concept is a mid-size saloon providing a glimpse into the Japanese brand's future design direction and how its next fleet of saloon cars may look. The car is packed with tech, including a digital dashboard and a new ProPilot autonomous driving system, which includes options for motorway driving. Some questioned why it was not electric, given that parent firm Nissan is so committed to such vehicles. The motor show was not all about cars. An autonomous concept truck was showed off by Swedish transportation start-up Einride. Huge amounts of goods travel by road and trucks account for a significant proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, so greener trucks are an important part of transport's future. The T-Pod is about 23ft (7m) long, can hold 15 standard pallets and its 200kWh battery provides up to 124 miles on a single charge. There are no windows and, perhaps most radically, nowhere for a driver to sit.\0.6630125045776367,0.08339542895555496,-0.8501739501953125,-0.40875327587127686,-0.7697644829750061,0.012416758574545383,0.8531954288482666,0.1345728635787964,-1.162915587425232,-0.19195407629013062,-0.2776544392108917,0.5378857851028442,-0.7682769894599915,0.928392767906189,-0.5916341543197632,0.24079808592796326,-1.271531105041504,0.5886795520782471,-0.6546112298965454,0.6489245295524597,1.0850023031234741,-0.6896167993545532,-0.44107773900032043,-1.5727382898330688,0.24597425758838654,0.8009732365608215,-0.08629443496465683,0.5785520672798157,0.24046185612678528,0.7413919568061829,-0.0579390749335289,0.043811723589897156,-0.23481455445289612,-0.04696710407733917,-0.8812536001205444,-0.9218739867210388,-0.6671313047409058,0.4714030623435974,0.1478959619998932,1.4106003046035767,-0.45134052634239197,-1.4354838132858276,1.0542196035385132,-0.5726673007011414,-0.9922087788581848,0.3536500930786133,0.350161075592041,0.7171594500541687,-1.773648738861084,-0.7802664637565613,0.9451358318328857,-0.55488121509552,-0.6592881083488464,0.0682775005698204,1.0746897459030151,-0.00576753169298172,-0.4465717077255249,1.2698700428009033,-0.00751847680658102,-0.5125594139099121,0.021873116493225098,0.05895283818244934,-1.112008810043335,-0.08072194457054138,-0.0072450824081897736,0.434175580739975,2.0055134296417236,1.7740347385406494,-0.12403056025505066,-0.11304757744073868,0.9260808825492859,0.562828540802002,0.13385255634784698,0.776767373085022,0.47931918501853943,0.3817630708217621,-0.8062630891799927,-0.2823503911495209,-1.8177454471588135,-1.7918972969055176,0.17544586956501007,-0.08389351516962051,-0.6886827945709229,0.4241933524608612,0.03657837212085724,-0.6875534653663635,1.154625415802002,-0.8304361701011658,0.9312804341316223,-0.7232760190963745,-0.4080336093902588,1.1928249597549438,-0.29269927740097046,1.0236420631408691,0.49031323194503784,0.742834210395813,-0.3117493987083435,0.2563214600086212,-1.3214014768600464,1.1616771221160889\BBC\Detroit Motor Show: What the cars of the future may look like\2018-01-18 12:57:46.0\
1853\Technology\Nintendo has unveiled its latest release, and it's a little less high-tech than you might expect. Dubbed Labo, it is a series of DIY accessories for the hit Nintendo Switch console which are made of cardboard. A preview video suggests they can transform the Switch's Joy-Con controllers into a piano, a fishing rod, a motorbike or even a robot suit. Nintendo said the range of "interactive build-and-play experiences" would be released on 20 April. Initial pricing will start at $70 (£51) in the US - including a cartridge of games designed to be played with the homemade controllers and a range of stickers to customise the creations. Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter This cardboard add-on might on the face of it seem a flimsy gimmick, but there are few fools at Nintendo. History tells us they know what they're doing. "Wild", "awesome", "insane and I love it" - just a handful of reactions plucked from the gaming press on Wednesday as news of Nintendo's cardboard experiment became known. The company that brought us the RumblePak and the Wii has rightly earned a reputation not just for being innovative, but playful. Playful in a way that manages to keep adults and children interested, like a good Pixar movie or Lego. This latest idea is so crazy it might just work. By tapping into the maker movement, Nintendo could potentially open up a whole new world of experiences on its smash hit Switch console, a device that many (myself included, I must say) were wary of when it was first released. The educational potential is also huge, though the price point of the Switch - $300 or so - probably rules it out as something schools might be able to hop on board with. Still, looks like great fun. The Switch breaks tradition with the firm's previous home consoles by allowing owners to use it for game-playing on the move. Earlier this month, it was named America's fastest-selling home games console. A total of 4.8 million units were sold in the US during the 10 months following its launch there on 3 March. The latest official figures from December show that the Switch sold a total of 10 million units worldwide in its first nine months. Analysts say its success has been helped by games such as Mario and Zelda titles.\0.10442803055047989,-0.21265853941440582,0.17480143904685974,-0.23370994627475739,0.06324601918458939,0.09728112071752548,0.946649968624115,-0.23303340375423431,-0.6075668334960938,-0.45189493894577026,-0.22967879474163055,0.300173819065094,0.039505042135715485,0.010411281138658524,-0.3302188813686371,0.4813787341117859,0.07847349345684052,0.3269377052783966,-0.3466442823410034,0.02520417608320713,0.21440647542476654,-0.7374853491783142,0.6738372445106506,-0.8939179182052612,-0.1782989650964737,1.2020392417907715,0.489318311214447,0.41624751687049866,0.4914122223854065,0.19496184587478638,0.6298941969871521,0.7027102708816528,0.2524850368499756,0.2620387077331543,-0.5633941292762756,-0.1307324320077896,-0.10996665805578232,-0.2951803207397461,-0.30126574635505676,0.35346975922584534,-1.1483122110366821,-0.421694815158844,0.9642686247825623,0.12962830066680908,-0.458272784948349,0.26555493474006653,0.8826017379760742,-0.5290430784225464,-0.3440172076225281,-0.7936532497406006,0.5873054265975952,-0.06951429694890976,-0.7100394368171692,0.37993234395980835,0.7510296702384949,0.0928569808602333,1.0920004844665527,0.03993777185678482,-0.45373889803886414,0.2994573414325714,0.6946235299110413,-0.02330848015844822,0.3152614235877991,-0.1612154245376587,0.06753195822238922,0.7101576924324036,1.0928789377212524,1.0981134176254272,-0.19504575431346893,0.03136621043086052,0.1389961540699005,-0.10188073664903641,-0.2764410972595215,0.6857194304466248,-0.46729713678359985,0.18085350096225739,-0.5505433082580566,0.3128710091114044,-0.8553122282028198,-0.4268377721309662,0.4033415913581848,-0.7954954504966736,-0.37401264905929565,0.856600284576416,-0.23525579273700714,-0.4556855857372284,0.48747578263282776,0.09009889513254166,0.11310247331857681,0.2593977451324463,0.4463012218475342,-0.03348151966929436,-0.26344242691993713,-0.11940483748912811,0.5030827522277832,-0.39248278737068176,-0.21266672015190125,-0.3036901354789734,-1.2475337982177734,0.40831562876701355\BBC\Nintendo Labo: The DIY cardboard accessory for Switch\2018-01-18 05:57:04.0\
1854\Technology\A US YouTube personality has been awarded damages from a British ex-boyfriend who posted videos onto the internet of them having sex. Chrissy Chambers became a leading "revenge porn" campaigner after she was alerted to the clips. The High Court in London heard that the accused - who cannot be named for legal reasons - had accepted liability for his unlawful activity. He also agreed to pay an undisclosed sum as well as to cover legal costs. Ms Chambers' lawyers have described the sum as "substantial". "[This] should serve as a severe warning to those who seek to extort and harm with revenge porn: you cannot do this with impunity, and you will be held accountable for your actions," said Ms Chambers following the case. "To every victim of this insidious kind of attack, I am here to say: You can fight back, and win. You will heal and move on - and you will not have to take those steps alone." The singer and comedian celebrated her successful civil claim by proposing to her girlfriend and YouTube co-star, Bria Kam, on the steps of the court. Ms Kam said yes. England and Wales made "revenge porn" a criminal offence in 2015, but Ms Chambers said she had been unable to take advantage of this as the law does not apply retrospectively. The court had heard that the accused had filmed the sexual activity on 3 September 2009 at Ms Chambers' home in Atlanta, Georgia. He subsequently uploaded six videos to a free-to-watch pornographic site between December the same year and January 2012, after they had split up. Some of the clips' titles contained Ms Chambers' name and her age at the time, which was 18. Ms Chambers, who is now 26, said that she had not been aware that she was being filmed at the time, and only learned of the videos' existence in June 2013, 19 months after they had been posted. Since the accused owned the copyright to the clips, Ms Chambers said she was unable to force the site to remove them. She said they had been copied and shared to dozens more sites since. She initially attempted to pursue criminal charges, but when this failed she crowdfunded $36,900 (£26,750) to file the civil case. Ms Chambers's lawyer told the court that some of the singer's YouTube followers had mistakenly believed she had intentionally been involved in making pornography and had posted messages saying that they no longer wanted to follow her. The lawyer added that the YouTuber had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and continued to have flashbacks and nightmares. As part of the settlement, the accused has agreed to destroy any remaining images of Ms Chambers in his possession and has handed over copyright to the uploaded films. This means Ms Chambers can now demand that the sites hosting the material delete it.\0.6287825703620911,0.39327389001846313,-0.4831298291683197,-0.6562677621841431,-0.3130686581134796,1.6669138669967651,-0.32232755422592163,0.3250194191932678,-1.1649291515350342,-0.6191010475158691,0.3749123215675354,0.29439210891723633,-0.5130085349082947,-0.04645643010735512,0.13508497178554535,0.21282467246055603,0.18351832032203674,-0.24588234722614288,0.5151810646057129,0.25804367661476135,0.27628573775291443,0.5524899959564209,0.2786009907722473,0.3771403431892395,-0.19310452044010162,-0.26606258749961853,1.125320553779602,-0.28297996520996094,0.9413242936134338,0.41943565011024475,1.0791336297988892,-0.4171675443649292,-0.21513845026493073,-0.1436757743358612,-0.1423361450433731,0.4117763936519623,-0.0361245758831501,-0.6537758111953735,1.252503752708435,-0.3961506187915802,-0.2998315393924713,-1.1804007291793823,0.23996318876743317,-0.3869161009788513,-0.19415314495563507,0.6332495808601379,0.13512027263641357,0.42718276381492615,-2.147087574005127,-0.6252660751342773,0.45353081822395325,0.33873674273490906,-1.0983742475509644,-0.07416436821222305,1.176498293876648,-0.6646533608436584,0.38614895939826965,-0.5552205443382263,-0.6234248876571655,0.1706201136112213,0.5927776098251343,-0.067575603723526,1.272281289100647,0.16103170812129974,0.26707255840301514,0.6331265568733215,0.5302393436431885,0.9392378330230713,-1.5348347425460815,0.9004387259483337,0.5176714658737183,-0.3212687373161316,-0.5375610589981079,0.16186094284057617,-0.5204634666442871,0.8825908899307251,0.0875781774520874,0.5014643669128418,-0.6357704401016235,0.07548104226589203,1.0323102474212646,0.6968110799789429,-0.2117532640695572,-0.17732030153274536,0.1291835904121399,0.4033571481704712,0.2043408751487732,0.31469273567199707,0.5851296186447144,-0.1273539513349533,-0.11384551972150803,0.7032082080841064,-0.46713724732398987,-0.07253944873809814,-0.7742810249328613,0.3723089098930359,-0.44338759779930115,0.12839123606681824,-0.41706013679504395,-0.014579909853637218\BBC\YouTube singer Chrissy Chambers wins revenge porn case\2018-01-17 16:55:01.0\
1855\Technology\Consumers are being guaranteed minimum speeds of 100Mbps in two new ultrafast broadband services from BT. Those who signed up to either package would get £20 compensation if their internet download speed fell below 100Mbps, up to four times a year, according to BT. But only 250,000 homes will be able to access the services - a fraction of all internet-connected premises. A price comparison site also questioned the "hefty" cost of the services. The Ultrafast Fibre 1 and 2 packages are now available in 46 locations, from Armley in West Yorkshire to Whitchurch in South Glamorgan and Donaldson in Edinburgh. They offer speeds of up to 152Mbps and 314Mbps respectively, and both come with speed guarantees. According to Ofcom, the average internet download speed in the UK stands at 44Mbps. Similar services are offered by Virgin Media, while relative newcomer Hyperoptic is installing fibre-optic cables that will offer speeds of 1,000Mbs to 80 luxury apartments in London this week, as part of a plan to reach five million homes by 2025. Rob Hilborn, of switching site Broadband Genie, welcomed BT's speed guarantee but said the new services, which will cost from £54.99 and £59.99, were expensive. "We recommend those that are able to upgrade to these packages first consider a standard fibre package rather than simply jumping up to the fastest package available," he said. "For most, this will be more than adequate and save you a significant amount of cash." Andrew Ferguson, co-founder of broadband news site ThinkBroadband, said: "The new service is aimed at those who can already get fairly good speeds, but with its largest competitor, Virgin Media, pushing hard with 200-350Mbps products, BT Consumer is now able to offer something with similar speeds which is probably critical to maintaining market share. "With the rise of online gaming leagues, having a stable connection for gaming at home is becoming more important. And in some areas Virgin Media has a legacy of being oversubscribed. Therefore, there may be lots of people willing to try an alternate service to see if the latency during gaming is more stable." The underlying technology behind the services is something known as G.fast. Openreach plans to roll out G.fast to 10 million premises by 2020. It has a shorter reach than the dominant fast broadband technology - known as VDSL2 - but the benefit is much higher speeds. According to Ofcom, the UK lags behind other countries in terms of its broadband speeds and reliability. The regulator says just 840,000 premises have access to full fibre services and 1.1 million still cannot get "decent" broadband of at least 10Mbps. BT's Openreach division, which maintains the UK's broadband infrastructure, has been criticised in the past for delivering a poor service and favouring BT over rival suppliers. In 2017 Ofcom ordered BT to legally separate the company so that it could "serve all of its customers equally". The UK government in December promised to make access to speeds of at least 10Mbps a legal requirement by 2020. Openreach had offered to carry out improvements according to its own timetable but the government rejected the offer. At the time, Openreach said it accepted the government's decision and wanted to "get on with the job of making decent broadband available to everyone in the UK".\0.6128280162811279,0.07830802351236343,-0.6426039934158325,-0.9758391976356506,-0.563834547996521,0.11769986897706985,-0.5476590394973755,-0.43844443559646606,-0.1293029487133026,-0.10920180380344391,-0.2748985290527344,1.1540888547897339,-0.12220746278762817,0.7155846953392029,-0.037736937403678894,0.12025155127048492,-0.6582218408584595,0.14989279210567474,-0.06392934173345566,0.9727036356925964,0.4426362216472626,-0.8305363059043884,-0.19955970346927643,-0.3957360088825226,1.0204460620880127,1.2181015014648438,0.002062120707705617,0.2531053423881531,1.4496018886566162,-0.43775197863578796,0.6510920524597168,-0.11241121590137482,-0.16146373748779297,-0.18324832618236542,-0.24775497615337372,-1.2497652769088745,0.977571964263916,0.02797972597181797,0.6027116179466248,-0.7411824464797974,-0.3766902685165405,0.08222998678684235,0.46063709259033203,0.07936742901802063,0.04272148385643959,-0.3395836353302002,-0.2721980810165405,0.7641287446022034,-1.6847182512283325,0.481256902217865,0.9092789888381958,0.050391245633363724,-0.6159794330596924,-0.42231976985931396,0.7974790930747986,-0.40315693616867065,0.10164371132850647,-0.5829030275344849,-0.3311569094657898,1.1127266883850098,-0.13500067591667175,0.5188491344451904,-0.39993512630462646,-0.8691620826721191,-0.24498870968818665,-0.35666313767433167,-0.11637114733457565,0.516230583190918,-0.2986086308956146,1.5855424404144287,-0.2460038959980011,-0.11043516546487808,-0.6981979012489319,-0.194198876619339,-0.2933661937713623,0.23637311160564423,-1.058927297592163,0.7310801148414612,-0.8628292083740234,-0.6446642279624939,-0.21388471126556396,0.14591248333454132,0.1718617081642151,0.9057210683822632,0.43252280354499817,-0.4603927433490753,0.0037817819975316525,-0.09309113770723343,1.0034079551696777,-0.5488103032112122,0.042359184473752975,0.7114687561988831,-0.09668140858411789,0.7965683937072754,-0.04316622391343117,1.225045084953308,0.20794352889060974,-0.39440909028053284,-0.7726405262947083,1.0433204174041748\BBC\BT guarantees broadband speeds for two new services\2018-01-17 14:14:13.0\
1856\Technology\YouTube is introducing tougher requirements for video publishers who want to make money from its platform. In addition, it has said staff will manually review all clips before they are added to a premium service that pairs big brand advertisers with popular content. The moves follow a series of advertiser boycotts and a controversial vlog that featured an apparent suicide victim. One expert said that the Google-owned service had been slow to react. "Google presents the impression of acting reactively rather than proactively," said Mark Mulligan, from the consultancy Midia Research. "It needs to get better at acting faster." The first part of the new strategy involves a stricter requirement that publishers must fulfil before they can make money from their uploads. Clips will no longer have adverts attached unless the publisher meets two criteria - that they have: YouTube said that this represented a "higher standard" than the previous requirement of 10,000 lifetime views, which was introduced nine months ago. It blogged that this should help it combat "spammers, impersonators, and other bad actors" as well as to prevent "potentially inappropriate videos from monetising, which can hurt revenue for everyone". YouTube faced a backlash from many of its creators, dubbed the "adpocalypse", last year when it prevented videos about some topics being able to include adverts. This was in response to more than 200 major brands pulling campaigns over concern their ads had been attached to clips featuring hate speech and other extremist content. Mr Mulligan suggested the latest change should prove less controversial. "In terms of impact on creators, this makes taking that first step to commercial status that bit harder to reach," he told the BBC. "But given how much the platform is growing, higher benchmarks will be easier to meet now than they were a few years ago." The second part of the effort focuses on the Google Preferred programme. This lets brands pay extra to attach their adverts to the top 5% of videos most popular with 18- to 34-year-olds. Until now, the process was automated. But YouTube said it would manually review all relevant content by the end of March. In theory, this process would have alerted YouTube to a controversial clip by vlogger Logan Paul at an earlier stage. At the end of last year, the 22 year-old American featured what appeared to be a dead man's body hanging from a tree in Japan's Aokigahara forest in one of his videos. Mr Paul - who has more than 15 million subscribers - was excluded from Google Preferred last week as a consequence. YouTube had previously announced that it planned to have more than 10,000 workers reviewing clips in general on the service by the end of 2018. It appears to acknowledge that further steps will be necessary to prevent a similar scandal in the future, and said it intended to "schedule conversations with our creators in the months ahead" to discuss ways to address the problem. But Mr Mulligan suggested that YouTube still faced a fundamental problem. "The Logan Paul experience highlights the risk that young creators like Logan have been shorn of the structure that their peers in traditional media have: the people to advise, guide and mentor them," he said. Manually and proactively reviewing videos on its most popular channels opens up a whole range of potential issues, even if that stipulation will apply only to those on its Google Preferred programme. Most notably, it removes YouTube's ability to duck behind its "as soon as we were made aware" defence when removing inappropriate content. Much like a traditional media company, it will need to make decency judgements, and the most skilled team in the world won't get it right 100% of the time. And when these hard decisions are made, don't expect YouTubers to like what the moderation team decides. Whether justified or not, YouTube will find itself accused of political bias, discrimination, racism and homophobia at various stages of this process. By reducing the number of channels able to monetise, YouTube shifts its moderation task from impossible to merely incredibly difficult. YouTube will be watching its algorithms closely. It will analyse how often the algorithms miss something, and if it becomes a sufficiently rare occurrence, expect this human moderation layer to be removed as soon as YouTube feels it's ready to take the risk.\0.575563371181488,-0.35710424184799194,-0.47644808888435364,-0.8785387277603149,-0.4373451769351959,0.20241974294185638,0.8602968454360962,-0.22934187948703766,-0.5071361064910889,0.6446081399917603,1.1833751201629639,1.3058075904846191,-0.37341928482055664,0.24828821420669556,-1.7482409477233887,1.4957412481307983,0.8511455059051514,-0.41635239124298096,0.3316170573234558,-0.5925289988517761,0.5638161301612854,-0.3516363203525543,0.38493356108665466,-0.3716849088668823,0.2604108452796936,-0.14775197207927704,1.2045762538909912,-0.01722612790763378,0.039609428495168686,0.5429739356040955,-0.19457656145095825,1.2259745597839355,-0.3455319106578827,-0.5791829228401184,-0.44064629077911377,-1.0220568180084229,-1.569265365600586,-0.6394931674003601,0.4127364456653595,1.6877244710922241,-0.1870410293340683,-1.8488554954528809,0.33266445994377136,-1.3940861225128174,-0.4253164231777191,-0.011922885663807392,0.3704639971256256,0.6937638521194458,-0.5071271657943726,0.03036314621567726,0.9956381320953369,0.3223506212234497,-0.6162143349647522,0.13041165471076965,1.0205318927764893,-0.35610273480415344,1.6442214250564575,0.14956729114055634,-0.9893669486045837,0.28226834535598755,-0.5335760712623596,-0.12910515069961548,-0.26102131605148315,-0.6568703651428223,-1.1209157705307007,-0.922970712184906,1.8258297443389893,1.7191468477249146,-0.9107661247253418,0.8750116229057312,0.8935902714729309,0.7002729177474976,-0.13427147269248962,-0.16519010066986084,-0.4744286835193634,0.9710079431533813,-0.7704503536224365,1.0079878568649292,0.012881487607955933,-1.3081693649291992,-0.04004690423607826,-0.5727876424789429,-0.45975181460380554,-0.011046625673770905,0.13611111044883728,-0.022920433431863785,0.41253072023391724,-0.5121903419494629,0.12348481267690659,0.11443702131509781,-0.09132730960845947,0.06930722296237946,-1.3708637952804565,0.8674765825271606,-0.17623470723628998,1.0751736164093018,0.21189548075199127,-0.6954264640808105,-0.9233930110931396,0.03313223645091057\BBC\YouTube toughens advert payment rules\2018-01-17 11:17:03.0\
1857\Technology\A campaign to teach children about copyright infringement on the internet, is employing cartoons and puns on pop stars' names, to get the message across. Even its makers admit it is a "dry" and "niche" subject for a cartoon aimed at seven-year-olds. But the Intellectual Property Office adds learning to "respect" copyrights and trademarks is a "key life skill". And it is hoping the adventures of Nancy and the Meerkats can finally make intellectual property "fun". The series, which began life five years ago on Fun Kids Radio, was re-launched this week with the aim of getting its message into primary schools. The Intellectual Property Office - formerly known as the Patent Office - has produced a range of teaching materials for Key Stage 2 in the national curriculum, for seven- to 11-year-olds. The five-minute cartoons tell the story of would-be pop star Nancy, a French bulldog, who battles her ideas-stealing, feline nemesis, Kitty Perry, and teaches friends, including Justin Beaver and a rather dim Welsh sheep called Ed Shearling, about the importance of choosing an original band name and registering it as a trademark. Most of the lessons are delivered by Nancy's sharp-suited but avuncular manager, Big Joe. The Intellectual Property Office is leading the government's efforts to crack down on internet piracy and protect the revenues of Britain's creative industries. The government agency is spending £20,000 of its own money on the latest Nancy campaign, which is part-funded by the UK music industry. Catherine Davies, head of the IPO's education outreach department, which already produces teaching materials for GCSE students, admitted IP was a "complex subject" for small children and something of a challenge to make accessible and entertaining. But she added: "In today's digital environment, even very young people are IP consumers, accessing online digital content independently and regularly. "They are creators of IP, and many will leave school or university to take up careers in industries that depend upon inventiveness and creativity. "A basic understanding of IP and a respect for others' IP rights is therefore a key life skill." But some fear the IPO is being too heavy-handed in its warnings about piracy and that the message could backfire. Jim Killock, director of the Open Rights Group campaign, said: "Some of the material seems misleading, in particular the episode explaining that downloading is the same as stealing from a shop. "While it's wrong, it is neither the same in law - as downloading is a civil wrong while theft is a crime - nor is it a convincing analogy. "The IPO risk educating children that copyright law is stupid and immoral by putting forward simplistic arguments like that." Public information films - such as the much-loved Charley Says campaign - warned a generation of children about the dangers of playing with matches or going off with strangers The genre has declined since its 1970s heyday, although Charley the cat made a comeback in 2014 in an electrical safety campaign voiced by comedian David Walliams. But government departments have also been turning to cartoons to educate very young children about boring and complicated subjects In 2016, HM Revenue & Customs produced a Junior Tax Facts video for eight- to 11-year-olds, which explained, among other things, that the VAT on sweets meant they were taxpayers too\1.2210379838943481,-0.002566389739513397,-0.11186233162879944,-0.7085763812065125,-0.047457437962293625,-0.6089492440223694,0.5201115012168884,0.4257376492023468,-0.7719139456748962,-0.5085670948028564,0.7669388651847839,-0.0972796231508255,-0.46974146366119385,0.4658069610595703,-0.916634202003479,-0.1465490311384201,-0.8003515005111694,0.05561254918575287,0.42301443219184875,-0.17829613387584686,0.28315916657447815,-1.2812013626098633,-0.41929173469543457,-0.17877963185310364,0.1500295102596283,0.773156464099884,0.3209335207939148,0.24574731290340424,-0.040533438324928284,0.6318385601043701,-0.42296990752220154,0.7086539268493652,-0.519991934299469,-0.319047749042511,0.30771374702453613,-0.9476324319839478,0.4294034540653229,-0.4068118929862976,-0.9193626046180725,-0.8163332939147949,-0.08449453115463257,-1.5155649185180664,0.8914877772331238,0.5613261461257935,-0.4984039068222046,0.7533591985702515,0.7800711989402771,0.0511091910302639,-0.6526983976364136,0.07728344202041626,0.18819402158260345,-0.7638744711875916,-0.2306089997291565,0.8996410965919495,1.6289699077606201,-0.07225009053945541,1.0311189889907837,0.37413471937179565,0.21714994311332703,0.23494155704975128,-0.22030647099018097,-0.5736678838729858,0.8547052145004272,-0.91170334815979,-1.3208616971969604,0.47216692566871643,0.3734637498855591,1.2155207395553589,-0.6219028234481812,0.11457221210002899,0.712599515914917,-0.5220435857772827,0.010284213349223137,0.6226396560668945,0.6047306656837463,-0.3511553406715393,0.14122961461544037,0.7627032995223999,-1.3398644924163818,-0.9940342903137207,-0.42661377787590027,-0.3632209897041321,-0.1827288419008255,1.6332144737243652,0.5179241299629211,1.0315968990325928,0.027677174657583237,0.380498468875885,-0.22607004642486572,-0.008613514713943005,-0.6763113737106323,0.2645380198955536,-0.5550277233123779,-0.2826700806617737,0.5767303705215454,-0.7090317010879517,0.17691169679164886,-1.3611034154891968,-0.7424095869064331,0.042684148997068405\BBC\Kitty Perry and the copyright lessons for seven-year-olds\2018-01-17 18:40:19.0\
1858\Technology\A pilot has flown a drone into a crane, according to an air-accident report. The pilot had planned the drone flight in Kent with four reference points, all at 400ft above ground level - higher than three existing cranes on the site. But another crane was erected after his site safety visit, and on take-off the drone crashed into the jib of the new structure, damaging the unmanned craft. The crash, in June last year, is listed in the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) update this month. The incident report was picked up by The Register. In a summary of the crash the AAIB stated: "The unmanned aircraft struck a crane during an autonomous flight to survey a construction site. The pilot, who had previously flown the pre-programmed mission at the site, had not taken into account the addition of a new crane." The 3DR Solo is an unmanned aircraft (UA) with a maximum take-off weight of 1.8 kg. With its flight controller it forms an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) and was being flown to document a construction site at Kemsley Mill, near Sittingbourne, using a Go Pro Hero 4 camera mounted on a gimbal below the aircraft. The AAIB report said that after hitting the crane, the drone "fell to the ground and was damaged, but there was no damage to the construction site". It added: "The crane had not been at the site during the previous flight, and from where the pilot was situated in the car park it was difficult for him or his observer to tell that it was about to strike the crane because of a lack of perspective." In his comments, the pilot said that in future he would plan such flights to ascend vertically to 400ft shortly after take-off, in a safe corridor, and would avoid cranes.\1.5085980892181396,0.03369778394699097,-0.12097280472517014,-0.30581408739089966,0.5192334055900574,0.04603060707449913,0.4480675160884857,0.26435160636901855,-1.5102522373199463,-0.6451600790023804,0.23894436657428741,0.7056170701980591,0.4678319990634918,0.2462805062532425,-0.6756784915924072,-0.21429979801177979,-0.6082471013069153,0.3288707137107849,-0.19892211258411407,0.507575273513794,0.6399405002593994,-0.6458740234375,-0.43494483828544617,-0.2574441134929657,0.3515671491622925,0.2833303213119507,0.6036422252655029,0.5385171175003052,0.20942817628383636,0.4108376204967499,-0.3019535541534424,0.0032050812151283026,-1.5679765939712524,0.08395811170339584,-0.13424605131149292,0.4010421931743622,-0.3846760094165802,-0.7221820950508118,-0.015645110979676247,0.27675798535346985,0.28325173258781433,-0.19141413271427155,1.029969573020935,0.31588509678840637,-0.07648152858018875,0.17415833473205566,1.2288604974746704,0.40311896800994873,-2.115170478820801,-0.49074989557266235,0.6145491003990173,0.17034894227981567,0.4567478895187378,0.7387604117393494,1.0104923248291016,0.28615978360176086,0.8374758958816528,-0.4459548592567444,-0.18480218946933746,0.08079931885004044,0.02741921693086624,0.4134363532066345,0.31626570224761963,-0.47798627614974976,-0.3019445240497589,-0.1369590163230896,0.6245017647743225,0.44341227412223816,-0.7064647078514099,0.7753922939300537,0.06092085689306259,0.21268202364444733,0.36541616916656494,-0.3943747878074646,-0.13348756730556488,0.15434372425079346,0.20689408481121063,0.15466783940792084,-1.2726651430130005,-0.9281299114227295,1.3280227184295654,-0.1703503280878067,-0.7438040375709534,0.27713772654533386,0.5876758098602295,-0.2468579262495041,0.7730537056922913,-0.3565402328968048,-0.027926160022616386,0.3453294634819031,-0.44994112849235535,1.6674752235412598,-0.35254940390586853,0.48465633392333984,0.7108310461044312,0.14348188042640686,0.36461296677589417,-0.0743921771645546,-0.1697872132062912,0.9726806282997131\BBC\Drone hit newly erected crane during Kent site survey - report\2018-01-17 15:40:14.0\
1859\Technology\Apple will pay about $38bn (£27.3bn) in tax on the roughly $250bn cash pile it holds outside the US following recent changes to American tax rules. The sum is expected to be the biggest payment under the reforms, which slash the US corporate tax rate. The tech giant also plans to build a new campus and create 20,000 new jobs in the US. Apple said its plans would contribute more than $350bn to the US economy over the next five years. The company has not said how much of its cash abroad would be brought back to the US. Chief executive Tim Cook said Apple is "focusing our investments in areas where we can have a direct impact on job creation". Apple employs about 84,000 people in the US and expects to spend $55bn with domestic suppliers and manufacturers this year. The company has data centres in seven states. On Wednesday, it broke ground on an expansion of its operations in Reno, Nevada. It plans to spend more than $10bn on data centres over five years, as part of a $30bn capital spending plan for the US. The location of Apple's new campus, which will house technical support staff, will be announced later in 2018. Apple had earlier said it planned $16bn in capital expenditures in 2018, up from about $15bn in the prior year. Apple is the latest company to promote plans to invest in America following the overhaul of the US tax code. The changes cut the corporate rate from 35% to 21%. They also stopped applying the corporate rate to profits that companies make overseas, in exchange for a one-off tax payment. President Donald Trump had argued the cuts would make the US more competitive and spur domestic companies to invest at home. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican congressman who spearheaded the tax overhaul, celebrated Apple's plans to invest in a post on Twitter. "This is great news for the American economy and for America's workers," he said. Opponents to the new tax law predicted much of the money firms saved from the cuts would go to share buybacks and higher dividends. CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said on Wednesday he expects Apple could repurchase as much as 10% of its shares over the next 12 to 18 months. The company has spent $166bn already to repurchase shares under a plan to return $300bn to shareholders by March 2019. Apple has previously called for simplification of US tax rules, amid criticism of its large overseas cash holdings and investigation by US tax authorities. The company's announcement of its planned investments comes as tech firms face questions from competition regulators, as well as calls to make devices less addictive. Apple is also facing legal action over its deliberate slowing of older iPhones. The firm reported nearly $230bn in sales and more than $48bn in profit for the 12 months ended 30 September.\-0.6755053400993347,-0.717833399772644,-0.13677692413330078,-1.1063244342803955,2.3387701511383057,0.12427225708961487,0.3706277310848236,-0.18472920358181,-1.021966814994812,0.7874704003334045,-0.6560004949569702,-0.39300423860549927,-0.37696757912635803,0.04825597628951073,-1.1042993068695068,-0.17613768577575684,-0.13022346794605255,0.06541354954242706,0.4872937500476837,0.17538727819919586,-1.097855567932129,-0.7248881459236145,0.1669161021709442,0.26780614256858826,0.21197271347045898,-0.22560058534145355,-0.021503552794456482,-0.15632863342761993,0.7013373970985413,0.251083642244339,-0.14367450773715973,0.19139356911182404,0.5219340920448303,-1.3336583375930786,0.5161734819412231,0.5571820735931396,0.1595080941915512,-1.4801093339920044,0.12326762825250626,0.5402188897132874,-0.9763060212135315,0.4142439067363739,0.12914909422397614,-0.8202134966850281,-0.5185879468917847,-0.567468523979187,0.1545221358537674,0.4585905075073242,0.6432088613510132,0.14828555285930634,-0.10479472577571869,0.189408540725708,-0.1879834085702896,-0.5253573060035706,1.134628415107727,0.18913604319095612,0.38506069779396057,0.015898989513516426,-0.09993482381105423,0.7194205522537231,-0.4242635667324066,-0.9984353184700012,-0.1598646640777588,1.0193243026733398,-0.9572288990020752,-0.018702644854784012,-0.7908453941345215,0.3777635395526886,-0.8906571865081787,-0.19078950583934784,0.42580661177635193,-0.2362179160118103,0.4678926169872284,-0.6058445572853088,-0.518571674823761,0.3865748941898346,-0.5732824802398682,-0.20278747379779816,-0.8583952784538269,-0.7535087466239929,0.8608919978141785,-0.40526124835014343,0.019344517961144447,1.5335075855255127,-0.16383913159370422,0.843955934047699,0.6036046147346497,0.46578317880630493,0.7058593034744263,0.016638752073049545,0.7017132639884949,0.3539009690284729,-1.2121198177337646,0.8633465766906738,-0.6187071800231934,-0.41884666681289673,1.0300183296203613,-0.4642934501171112,-1.2704755067825317,-0.7228534817695618\BBC\Apple to pay $38bn on foreign cash pile\2018-01-17 20:31:33.0\
1860\Technology\A woman who says she was abducted in Belgium has been found after locating herself on her smartphone and sharing the address with her brother. The 19-year-old student said five men kidnapped her in front of a nightclub in the capital Brussels on Friday. She told police she was drugged and kept locked in a flat in the nearby city of Charleroi for three days. Two suspects have been arrested and charged with kidnapping and rape. They deny any wrongdoing. The alleged kidnappers had taken the woman's device but on Monday she managed to recover it, EFE news agency reports. She then located herself via Google Maps and sent the address in Charleroi - 50km (30 miles) from Brussels - to her brother, who alerted the authorities. The woman accused the five men of repeatedly raping her. In a late night operation on Monday, police also found two men - both known to the authorities - in the flat. Reports said one was born in 1992 and the other in 1994. The men said the woman had a relationship with one of them and had followed the group voluntarily. The search for three other suspects continues.\0.9933121204376221,0.6267658472061157,-0.31037062406539917,0.1955716460943222,-0.17454150319099426,0.5254290699958801,0.41141587495803833,-0.5243492126464844,-0.9465690851211548,-1.0638320446014404,0.17865966260433197,0.8724831342697144,-0.08879028260707855,-0.5487903952598572,-0.3279339075088501,0.2885902225971222,-0.57670658826828,-0.2219681292772293,-0.11020322889089584,0.7623955607414246,0.5562700629234314,-0.03958693519234657,-0.14645546674728394,0.4514014422893524,-0.21041083335876465,0.1384720802307129,0.5731438994407654,-0.0196500513702631,0.4584009647369385,0.28659337759017944,-0.21347676217556,0.1066976860165596,-0.33642512559890747,-0.35091662406921387,0.4614534378051758,0.12454192340373993,0.00358680821955204,0.1112556979060173,0.1943240910768509,-0.2708595097064972,-0.5338015556335449,-0.3650330901145935,0.003834689036011696,-0.12384983152151108,-0.4247860908508301,-0.20132791996002197,-0.033392973244190216,-0.27999019622802734,-1.0066572427749634,-0.8355798721313477,0.5786610841751099,0.05597265809774399,-0.2561895251274109,0.1175316870212555,0.3649977147579193,-0.2845231592655182,0.26157164573669434,0.21867592632770538,0.05320866033434868,0.4678373336791992,0.27977702021598816,0.6725262999534607,0.44053351879119873,-0.4746954143047333,-0.02649536356329918,0.9350963830947876,-0.10074809938669205,1.5218781232833862,-0.4293041229248047,1.0204063653945923,0.0630921870470047,0.1791498064994812,-0.25994887948036194,0.9735202193260193,-0.3751506507396698,0.07698310166597366,9.931601816788316E-4,0.404295414686203,-0.23622199892997742,-0.14643427729606628,0.5739685893058777,-0.0210281815379858,-0.13839001953601837,0.468679815530777,0.3371197283267975,-0.19751882553100586,0.24580992758274078,0.6415853500366211,-0.09698453545570374,0.6728686690330505,-0.23390252888202667,0.14578120410442352,0.010687286034226418,-0.742953360080719,-0.33123400807380676,0.15507061779499054,-0.6410930156707764,-0.6631678938865662,0.37488919496536255,0.06988143920898438\BBC\Belgium 'abduction': Woman uses phone map to provide her location\2018-01-17 13:41:28.0\
1861\Technology\Bitcoin has traded below $10,000 for the first time since early December. The value of one bitcoin fell to $9,958 (£7,222) before making a slight recovery, according to a price index run by the news site Coindesk. However, it later fell again dipping just below $9,200. That represents a drop of more than 53% since it peaked close to $19,800 five weeks ago. Other crypto-currencies have also experienced steep falls, including Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. There has been concern among some experts that a bubble had been forming in the market as casual investors piled into an asset they did not fully understand. It is notoriously difficult to be certain of what causes moves in Bitcoin's value - the asset has been much more volatile than most traditional currencies and commodities to date - but speculation that regulators may be about to restrict trade has been causing concern. In particular, South Korea has suggested that it might soon take action. "The government stance is that it needs to regulate crypto-currency investment as it is a largely speculative investment," its finance minister Kim Dong-yeon said in a radio interview on Tuesday. "The shutdown of virtual currency exchanges is still one of the options [that the government has]." Earlier this week, the Bloomberg news agency reported that the Chinese authorities were planning to restrict local access to crypto-currency trading platforms, having already taken steps to curb Bitcoin mining - the process that validates transactions. Investors may also have been spooked by Bitconnect's announcement that it was closing down its lending and exchange platform on Tuesday. The business had centred on its own digital token - the Bitconnect Coin - which crashed in value following the announcement, despite the firm saying it would still be supported. Bitconnect said it had faced "continuous bad press" - including claims it had been running a Ponzi scheme - and had received cease-and-desist letters from two US watchdogs. Last Wednesday, the influential investor Warren Buffett predicted further trouble ahead, although he was vague about the timing. "In terms of crypto-currencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending," he told CNBC . "When it happens or how or anything else, I don't know." However, photography firm Kodak has seen its stock price soar since last Tuesday when it announced its involvement with two crypto-currency-related ventures.\0.2797906994819641,0.35519760847091675,0.6127850413322449,-0.8730456233024597,0.07789783924818039,0.0977301076054573,-0.28258317708969116,-0.6107821464538574,-1.0869719982147217,0.05484126880764961,0.0403704009950161,0.013887280598282814,0.20078405737876892,-0.1661873459815979,0.10315344482660294,0.8394736051559448,-0.2504902780056,0.16565097868442535,0.0234611164778471,-0.30880260467529297,0.7806840538978577,0.03676154091954231,-0.5503711104393005,0.2659156322479248,-0.6019448041915894,0.4933803677558899,0.3120780289173126,-0.44335246086120605,0.07366862893104553,1.4787168502807617,-0.14654576778411865,-0.4574744999408722,0.024384327232837677,0.09664689004421234,0.5465202927589417,-0.45290955901145935,0.3989042639732361,-0.31728431582450867,0.18979881703853607,1.0466370582580566,-0.5810760855674744,-0.8042258620262146,0.10786353796720505,0.6980317234992981,-0.08319780975580215,-0.6407182812690735,0.21589568257331848,0.9897848963737488,-1.0409619808197021,0.842162013053894,0.36229774355888367,0.40878304839134216,-1.046147346496582,-0.05558062717318535,0.3221980333328247,-0.16308778524398804,-0.3828337490558624,0.084754578769207,0.4058021306991577,0.6416965126991272,0.7806714773178101,0.06229124218225479,0.04850423336029053,-0.26369017362594604,-0.47165074944496155,0.010709165595471859,1.2227623462677002,1.0409170389175415,-0.38945960998535156,-0.060226984322071075,0.07686294615268707,-0.020048562437295914,-0.8669906854629517,1.1947919130325317,-0.09383565932512283,-0.10601416230201721,-0.15606117248535156,0.5023741126060486,-0.752265214920044,-0.908242404460907,-0.08869097381830215,-0.8670344352722168,-1.4551634788513184,0.8929708003997803,-0.5434691905975342,-0.35835975408554077,0.17765110731124878,-0.18216373026371002,-0.16145280003547668,0.407156765460968,0.5342738628387451,0.177165225148201,-0.5349683165550232,-0.06115312501788139,0.24494291841983795,-0.6940705180168152,-0.5564253330230713,-0.5949987173080444,-0.3261546790599823,0.10878241062164307\BBC\Bitcoin dips below $10,000 for first time since December\2018-01-17 14:01:25.0\
1862\Technology\A flaw that left the personal data of thousands of users of a virtual reality porn app exposed has been fixed. British cybersecurity firm Digital Interruption uncovered a loophole in the SinVR app that gave it access to 20,000 user names and email addresses. SinVR thanked it for highlighting the issue and promised to improve security. "Altogether, it has been a tremendous learning experience," the US-based company told tech site Alphr. "Moving forward, we are confident in our ability to stop similar attacks and will keep using a professional security service to audit our system." SinVR is a pornographic virtual reality game which lets users explore various adult-themed environments and interact with virtual characters. It works with most major VR headsets including the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. In a blog post, Digital Interruption said it had decided to go public after SinVR's parent company, inVR, did not respond to emails about the app's flaws. The cybersecurity firm, which had been reviewing the security of several adult-themed websites, said it accessed the personal data of everyone with a SinVR account as well as anyone who paid for content using PayPal. Passwords and credit card details were not exposed in the hack, it said. "Due to the nature of the application, it is potentially quite embarrassing to have details like this leaked," Digital Interruption wrote in its blog post. "It is not outside the realm of possibility that some users could be blackmailed with this information." It's not the first time the personal data of those who visit porn sites has been exposed. In 2016 the names of almost 800,000 registered users of porn site Brazzers were exposed in a data breach. And last year, German researchers claimed to have accessed the porn-browsing habits of members of the public by reverse-engineering online data used for targeted advertising.\0.8931063413619995,-0.02719167433679104,-0.1738561987876892,0.09197094291448593,-0.2664912939071655,-0.21763651072978973,-0.015626057982444763,0.3814312517642975,-0.8579385280609131,-0.2529168128967285,-0.007948316633701324,0.5592882037162781,-0.5555566549301147,0.0892970934510231,-0.4721546471118927,-0.04955450817942619,-0.1443614810705185,-0.03221374377608299,0.2624706029891968,-0.6321749091148376,0.04378124326467514,-0.6620633602142334,-0.19234290719032288,-0.24136869609355927,-0.6118447184562683,0.27532973885536194,-0.10484788566827774,-0.34241655468940735,0.38074421882629395,-0.2343807965517044,0.2285464107990265,0.05303369462490082,0.673439085483551,0.04961268603801727,-0.15982167422771454,-0.7500000596046448,0.6755020022392273,-0.8639822602272034,0.6558313369750977,-0.12358349561691284,-0.683552622795105,-0.5423000454902649,0.08934228122234344,-0.1314459890127182,-0.20780999958515167,-0.7558964490890503,0.6452282667160034,0.729110598564148,-0.693119466304779,-0.2797507643699646,0.0030542067252099514,-0.55842125415802,0.06132320314645767,-0.44109445810317993,0.21175892651081085,-0.38919997215270996,-0.04069959372282028,0.2942342460155487,0.14418573677539825,0.6818527579307556,0.1540369838476181,-0.05516134575009346,0.016741327941417694,-0.2195049524307251,0.2186073362827301,-0.8256549835205078,0.16172149777412415,1.1273789405822754,-0.9065915942192078,0.5630726218223572,0.08272845298051834,0.18005403876304626,-0.06611952185630798,-0.5803579688072205,0.7370946407318115,-0.18688654899597168,-0.17156481742858887,0.34707173705101013,-0.4871508777141571,-1.3900893926620483,0.8663355708122253,-0.024785958230495453,0.397688627243042,0.26599788665771484,-0.11475508660078049,0.11836095154285431,0.5174704790115356,-0.7650030255317688,0.11348416656255722,0.3011590838432312,-0.2584221065044403,0.25389838218688965,-1.009883999824524,0.677314817905426,-0.15869872272014618,0.5864553451538086,-0.24687959253787994,-0.5898365378379822,-0.6213334202766418,-0.3579941987991333\BBC\Flaw in VR porn app leaves 20,000 names exposed\2018-01-16 13:04:54.0\
1863\Technology\A Canadian man has been accused of spamming streaming site Twitch with racist and homophobic messages. In court papers, Brandan Lukus Apple was alleged to be the spammer behind attacks on Twitch early last year. During each attack, more than 1,000 broadcasts were disrupted by the massive number of messages being sent. Mr Apple has been charged with "mischief in relation to computer data". No defence against the charges has been filed by Mr Apple, reported Canadian news channel CBC. The case is due to go to court in February. According to the court documents, Mr Apple runs a service that lets people send lots of junk messages or spam as email messages or as comments to other messaging systems. The criminal charge of mischief emerged from work Twitch did to find out who was behind the 2017 spamming surge. About 1,000 Twitch streamers were hit in the attack which disrupted broadcasts. At its peak, said Twitch in its court filings, chat channels were getting hit by up to 600 messages per minute. As well as containing racial and sexual slurs, the messages linked to disturbing images, solicited obscene material and accused streamers of using software bots to exaggerate their popularity. According to Twitch, its investigation revealed that the junk messages had been sent by a service called ChatSurge that is allegedly owned and operated by Mr Apple. This investigation led Twitch to start a civil action against Mr Apple. It ended with the Canadian supreme court issuing an order that restrained Mr Apple from making or distributing software or services that could be used to harm Twitch.\1.8348132371902466,0.8387504816055298,-0.5032067894935608,-0.7947015762329102,-0.5071566700935364,-0.04796132817864418,0.20298001170158386,-0.21813711524009705,-0.6581472754478455,0.35336077213287354,-0.5770028233528137,-0.6697765588760376,0.1624779850244522,-0.21850107610225677,-0.7965388894081116,0.131805419921875,-0.20489366352558136,0.02899002842605114,0.2668815553188324,0.10286970436573029,0.4119206666946411,0.18746764957904816,-0.15388551354408264,-0.31837281584739685,-0.45404720306396484,0.2591579854488373,0.6659340262413025,0.4375629723072052,0.3843567669391632,-0.013483124785125256,-0.1287439465522766,0.0987294539809227,-0.24639302492141724,0.2573516070842743,-0.1288033127784729,-0.5209725499153137,-0.08973823487758636,-0.3962186872959137,-0.5224127173423767,0.030369620770215988,-0.5694727897644043,-0.4087457060813904,0.5777724981307983,0.7995078563690186,0.018134333193302155,0.010781604796648026,0.5496957898139954,-0.22874552011489868,-0.4754635691642761,-0.021258534863591194,0.4998743236064911,-0.48380371928215027,0.2852122485637665,0.8875521421432495,1.3166157007217407,-0.9039561748504639,-0.2188429832458496,-0.35266128182411194,-0.9418051838874817,0.8400310277938843,0.5976651906967163,-0.6305584907531738,0.6463868021965027,0.5824332237243652,-0.08334814757108688,-0.08602816611528397,1.0962355136871338,1.0122324228286743,-1.2234770059585571,0.73412024974823,0.515166163444519,-0.0752086415886879,-0.276306688785553,0.5661453008651733,-0.2940818965435028,0.3094586431980133,-0.30029311776161194,0.3641604781150818,0.1522643119096756,0.07297556102275848,1.1476768255233765,0.12890933454036713,-0.7854962348937988,-0.44084227085113525,0.2721647620201111,0.4933059811592102,0.4800405204296112,0.010764874517917633,0.1745171844959259,-0.9837602376937866,-0.659843385219574,0.7986881732940674,-0.5360785126686096,0.067003034055233,0.40767472982406616,0.17790693044662476,-0.5786387324333191,-1.3341327905654907,-1.1272861957550049,0.25586172938346863\BBC\Twitch spamming suspect charged in Canada\2018-01-16 15:59:29.0\
1864\Technology\South Korea's government has been signalling that it plans to crack down on cryptocurrency trading. Exactly how it will do this remains vague. But just the threat of action has been enough to drive a sell-off across the market globally. Bitcoin, for example, has lost nearly a quarter of its value in the past week. And so on Wednesday the virtual currency - which last month looked set to breach the $20,000 (£14,500) mark - was trading closer to $12,000. Prices of cryptocurrencies are volatile at the best of time. Rises and falls of 10% or more in a day are not uncommon. And pinning down rationale for those sharp movements often involves guesswork. But it seems that events in one relatively small Asian nation can have a significant effect on the market. South Korea is the third-biggest market in the world for Bitcoin trades, behind Japan and the US, according to the digital currency website Coinhills. That's an estimate made by looking at counting the volume of Bitcoins that have been exchanged for various currencies. Of course, a buyer could be sitting in Singapore or Serbia while using South Korean won to trade, but the Coinhills breakdown is pretty much the best we have to go on. The Korea Blockchain Industry Association estimates that South Korea has more than a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges. And there's so much demand that the virtual currency has traded at as much as a 30% premium compared with other countries. Taken together, you get a decent feel for how big this industry has become in a country of fewer than 50 million people. Amid tales of schoolchildren and housewives rushing in to buy virtual currency, South Korea's government has branded the trend "irrational". And so when trading exchanges are being raided by the tax authorities and your justice minister mentions potential bans on all cryptocurrency trading, it is perhaps little wonder that the industry globally is noticing and that markets are responding. Many South Koreans, especially among the younger generations, are digital-loving and tech-savvy, which makes digital currencies something appealing to explore and perhaps dabble in. The country has first-class infrastructure for IT networks and offers very fast internet connections - all things which make trading cryptocurrencies easier and faster. According to analytics firm WiseApp, the number of cryptocurrency app users in South Korea has increase 14-fold in the past three months to about two million users. Most are in their 30s with users spending an average of 26 minutes on the apps daily. The huge price rises enjoyed by many virtual currencies during 2017, and the associated media coverage, is a major reason so many worldwide have decided to invest in, or gamble with, this new technology. In South Korea it's suggested this appeal has been amplified by the state of the economy which has been slowing in recent years. Rising unemployment, especially among young people, is also being linked with a growing number of people looking at new ways to try and make money. So unsurprisingly, with so many South Koreans keen to fulfil their financial hopes and dreams through cryptocurrency trades, there is resistance to plans for a crypto-clampdown. More than 200,000 people have now signed a petition on President Moon Jae-in's official website asking that the "happy dreams" of Bitcoin traders in South Korea can remain in place. South Korea's government has made a commitment to answer such petitions that reach more than 200,000 signatures within 30 days. Meaning this debate has a long way to run.\0.8700613975524902,-0.37862342596054077,0.2080492228269577,-0.7981298565864563,0.6759397387504578,-0.9548096656799316,1.3854340314865112,-0.26669591665267944,-0.4958876073360443,0.02474796772003174,-0.08784618973731995,-0.0492716059088707,0.09467804431915283,-0.9132277369499207,-0.5712736248970032,-0.47584912180900574,0.34077441692352295,-0.5597154498100281,-0.44798344373703003,0.09947692602872849,0.028941096737980843,0.37099459767341614,0.9581595063209534,0.0694379135966301,-0.19187280535697937,1.3849596977233887,-1.090413212776184,-0.9965007901191711,-0.6170483827590942,0.568109393119812,-0.3794247806072235,0.29035669565200806,0.9919662475585938,0.0016639571404084563,-0.7365670204162598,-0.8177899122238159,-0.9358068108558655,-0.5582699775695801,0.9146360754966736,0.5503045916557312,-1.3639280796051025,-0.9441856741905212,0.6396033763885498,0.7572109699249268,-0.7283852696418762,0.01655583083629608,0.12400791794061661,1.2146015167236328,-0.2194870561361313,0.8429786562919617,0.9252294898033142,0.10750553756952286,-0.5487575531005859,0.4471512734889984,1.2967137098312378,-1.0383861064910889,0.20489554107189178,0.06691087037324905,-0.4348567724227905,0.1364375352859497,1.03117835521698,-0.7311590909957886,0.9590720534324646,-0.985308825969696,-0.7640751600265503,0.1740754097700119,1.6987656354904175,0.8858646750450134,0.554954469203949,0.3635885417461395,1.0342835187911987,0.7380866408348083,-0.2636794149875641,0.1862454116344452,-0.19006679952144623,-0.5911135077476501,-0.9464937448501587,-0.20645353198051453,-1.2923152446746826,-1.6331435441970825,-0.40040478110313416,-0.3100367784500122,-0.4548768103122711,1.6831588745117188,-0.30387523770332336,0.14127734303474426,-0.38215214014053345,0.345794141292572,0.19792070984840393,0.35649627447128296,0.1275748610496521,-0.340011864900589,0.8026472926139832,0.5497723817825317,-0.5311049818992615,0.051648106426000595,-0.48720136284828186,-1.1452794075012207,0.2625749707221985,0.23064471781253815\BBC\Bitcoin: South Korea sways cryptocurrency prices - but how?\2018-01-17 08:16:19.0\
1865\Technology\Android phone company OnePlus is investigating claims that customers' credit card numbers have been stolen after they used its online shop. The company has stopped taking credit card payments while it investigates. It was alerted to the issue by a customer message on its support site which linked a purchase on the site to fraudulent activity on their account. Then, that message prompted a flurry of replies from other customers reporting similar experiences. OnePlus said it was auditing its site as it investigated. In a statement, OnePlus said the fraud reports had come from customers who had bought phones directly from its oneplus.net website. "This is a serious issue and we are investigating around the clock," it added. A poll on the support site suggests more than 200 people, across many different countries, have seen fraudulent charges, ranging from $50 (£36) to $3,000, appear on cards used on the site. In some cases, banks and card processors flagged the transactions as fraudulent and stopped the payments. OnePlus said it did not do any card processing itself nor did it save any payment information surrendered when people purchased its phones.

1866\Technology\Uber is introducing a new policy on drivers' hours across the UK next week, which it says will help to increase safety for drivers and passengers. A licensed driver on its app must take an uninterrupted six-hour break after 10 hours of driving with a passenger or travelling to pick up someone. Drivers who do not take a long enough break will not be able to log in to the app and take trips. The ride-hailing firm says it believes the move "is an industry first". But the association that represents black cab drivers told the BBC it was "a toothless cap". Andrew Byrne, Uber's head of policy, said: "We are not aware of any other private hire operator in the UK that has introduced such a limit. "While drivers only spend an average of 30 hours a week logged into our app, we want to do our part to ensure they don't drive tired." A director of the National Private Hire and Taxi Association told the BBC: "There is no rule for our drivers. "Over the last two decades there have been at least three attempts made by the European Commission to put UK taxi and private hire vehicles under the working time directive. "But it's never been allowed to happen because our taxis, unlike buses and coaches, do not have a tachograph fitted so we can't keep track of drivers' hours or restrict them." Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association for black cab drivers, told the BBC: "This is a toothless cap that still allows Uber's drivers to work over 100 hours a week, and is a PR stunt that will not improve passenger safety. "Uber can't claim its drivers are self-employed and aren't subject to minimum wage, but then try to limit the hours that they can work." "Unlike Uber drivers, all black cab drivers undertake enhanced driving tests and as such are well aware of the dangers of working long hours. This high standard of safety is reflected in the low number of accidents involving licensed black cab drivers".\1.2530218362808228,-0.5367055535316467,-1.0801149606704712,-0.42954424023628235,-0.18008215725421906,-0.0859140157699585,0.7334014177322388,-0.1077692061662674,-0.5507951378822327,-0.7999364137649536,0.01715201511979103,0.7331588864326477,-0.09014841914176941,0.3976718783378601,-1.6456667184829712,0.396074503660202,-0.7075227499008179,0.9810478091239929,0.5510664582252502,-0.1584518551826477,0.5378262400627136,0.2097122073173523,0.3828205168247223,-0.9529119729995728,-0.08229722082614899,0.4298057556152344,-0.10380023717880249,0.037771157920360565,-0.11735212057828903,0.1593356430530548,-0.17229323089122772,0.3905004858970642,0.43011730909347534,0.391590416431427,-0.2791290283203125,-0.2744184732437134,-0.5352634787559509,-0.5547031164169312,0.14108766615390778,0.11882863193750381,0.6402870416641235,-0.5710711479187012,0.8442981839179993,-0.15377525985240936,-0.2092447727918625,0.43835973739624023,0.3337196707725525,0.5046148896217346,-0.9181294441223145,0.15918242931365967,0.43491220474243164,-0.30756086111068726,-0.4876779615879059,-0.3073574900627136,0.6659688949584961,-0.06914099305868149,0.8492857813835144,-0.31208735704421997,-1.0349984169006348,0.7640067338943481,-0.6662342548370361,0.7674829363822937,0.49049943685531616,0.1525098979473114,0.010621602647006512,0.08867937326431274,0.9272764921188354,1.7022031545639038,-0.27493301033973694,-0.021194031462073326,0.2972394824028015,0.5564668774604797,-0.1780546009540558,0.2547004222869873,-0.2501055598258972,-0.19143232703208923,-1.0642000436782837,0.5975519418716431,-0.30042415857315063,-1.5058239698410034,0.2613520622253418,0.10392028838396072,-0.6999125480651855,0.20332109928131104,0.3196379244327545,0.1687801480293274,0.49613937735557556,0.2723395526409149,0.25802522897720337,0.7157491445541382,-0.5279080867767334,0.05740286037325859,-0.43377038836479187,0.33116164803504944,-0.07091448456048965,0.5804098844528198,0.3411358892917633,-0.8008103370666504,-0.934402585029602,0.2509693503379822\BBC\Uber to introduce limit on drivers' hours\2018-01-16 16:42:04.0\
1867\Technology\Ford says it will boost its investment in electric vehicles to $11bn (£8bn) in the next five years, more than doubling a previous commitment. Chairman Bill Ford said the car maker would have 40 hybrid and fully electric vehicles in its range by 2022. It comes as countries around the world put more pressure on car makers to rein in carbon emissions. General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen have already outlined ambitious plans to offer more electric vehicles. Speaking at the Detroit Auto Show on Sunday, Mr Ford said the focus would be on electrifying existing Ford models without naming any specific cars. He said the firm would offer 16 fully electric vehicles by 2022 and 24 plug-in hybrids. Mr Ford told reporters: "We're all in on this and we're taking our mainstream vehicles, our most iconic vehicles, and we're electrifying them. "If we want to be successful with electrification, we have to do it with vehicles that are already popular." Stephanie Brinley, a senior automotive analyst at IHS Markit, said it was part of a bigger trend of car makers investing in electrification. "Part of it is about tougher regulation but also the expectation that electric vehicles will support autonomous driving. "The big question is how quickly consumers will adapt, as electric is only 1% of the market right now. "Changing that will take better infrastructure on our roads, but also having more electric vehicles available." Last year, America's biggest carmaker GM said it would add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its range by 2023. Volkswagen said in November it would spend $40bn on electric cars, autonomous driving and new mobility services by the end of 2022 - doubling a previous commitment. Ford's $11bn investment pledge is much higher than a previously announced target of $4.5bn by 2020 and was spearheaded by new chief executive Jim Hackett. During the Detroit show, Ford teased the release of its first performance electric vehicle - the Mach 1 - without giving any details about how it would look or its spec. The firm announced an upgraded Mustang Bullitt sports car inspired by an earlier version, made in the 1960s and 70s, and will be released in 2020. The US firm also unveiled a more fuel-efficient version of its Ranger pick-up truck, the Ranger 2019. The SUV will have a 2.3-litre EcoBoost engine, 10-speed auto transmission and automatic emergency braking.\-0.9346737265586853,-0.5076843500137329,0.20087306201457977,0.8366422653198242,1.1474956274032593,-0.1892549991607666,0.6456294655799866,0.03013007529079914,-0.1113719791173935,-0.18221504986286163,0.020700007677078247,0.08935068547725677,0.47581717371940613,0.4119146168231964,0.01565258763730526,0.4380967617034912,-0.014486297965049744,0.08308959752321243,0.4444398581981659,1.0533254146575928,0.2052520513534546,-0.8464192152023315,0.5024093389511108,-0.9614692330360413,0.057709258049726486,0.8584246039390564,0.144500732421875,-0.46608805656433105,0.557995617389679,-0.35129258036613464,-0.15250244736671448,0.16004040837287903,-0.2527320981025696,-0.10099567472934723,0.5697958469390869,-0.6760905385017395,-0.4025843143463135,0.18442068994045258,0.6128899455070496,0.8982193470001221,-0.8914573788642883,-0.47273197770118713,0.4362648129463196,-0.088796466588974,-1.2231708765029907,0.07942862063646317,0.07806739956140518,0.6958313584327698,-1.1584699153900146,0.16692115366458893,0.46446794271469116,-0.16277284920215607,-0.5140963792800903,-0.21816416084766388,0.444947212934494,0.007844042032957077,-0.8217586874961853,1.5648452043533325,0.09605526179075241,-0.6621776819229126,0.045331649482250214,0.39607059955596924,-0.11945825815200806,-0.24096854031085968,-0.765839159488678,-0.2128189355134964,1.1527074575424194,-0.43292397260665894,-0.324339359998703,-0.7814808487892151,0.3698597550392151,-0.030860304832458496,-0.0419263131916523,1.1996910572052002,0.7989726066589355,-0.004788166843354702,-0.566536009311676,0.5422889590263367,-0.6479966640472412,0.09250538051128387,0.26559579372406006,-0.4832687973976135,-0.048809412866830826,0.24841788411140442,0.043295834213495255,-0.7198436856269836,0.5675216317176819,-0.09788359701633453,0.14537915587425232,-0.012771307490766048,-0.3379835784435272,0.6847867965698242,0.03546284884214401,1.8922672271728516,0.76760333776474,0.19918052852153778,-0.4338321089744568,0.2043888419866562,-0.9033588171005249,0.8927029371261597\BBC\Ford to boost investment in electric cars by 2022\2018-01-15 15:35:42.0\
1868\Technology\More than 1,000 young people have been charged by police in Denmark with distributing sexually explicit material. They are accused of using Facebook Messenger to share indecent video clips of two 15-year-olds having sex. Police said it could amount to distribution of indecent images of children, as the two people filmed are under 18. Facebook tipped off the US authorities, who notified police in Denmark. One thousand and four young people from across the country are facing charges after allegedly circulating the material via the messaging app in autumn last year. Some suspects are over 18 and were called to police stations to be interviewed. Suspects under 18 were contacted through their parents. A Danish police superintendent said the charges come as a warning to young people never to share sex videos.

1869\Technology\Hackers have stolen $400,000 (£290,000) of the virtual currency Stellar Lumen in an online attack on Saturday. The group hijacked the server that hosts BlackWallet, a web-based wallet application that stores lumens and stole 669,920 from users' accounts Stellar Lumen is thought to be the eighth most popular virtual currency in the world. According to tech news site Bleeping Computer, BlackWallet tried to warn users about the attack via forums. However, many continued to log in and lose money. The hackers have moved the money to Bittrex, a virtual currency exchange, where they are likely to convert it into another digital currency to hide their tracks, Bleeping computer reported. In a post on social website Reddit, BlackWallet's creator said he had since disabled his hosting account and websites. The developer, who goes by the alias of Orbit84, said: "I am sincerely sorry about this and hope that we will get the funds back. "I am in talks with my hosting provider to get as much information about the hacker and will see what can be done with it. "If you ever entered your key on BlackWallet, you may want to move your funds to a new wallet." A crypto or virtual currency is a type of money that is completely digital. You can use currencies such as Bitcoin to buy products and services, but not many shops accept them yet. In many countries they are heavily regulated. Owners typically keep their currency in digital wallets and can transfer payments to other wallets fairly anonymously, without a bank or broker being involved. Transactions are recorded in a public list called a blockchain - a type of ledger which both records and verifies who spent or transferred which coins. The blockchain exists on computers that solve cryptographic problems as they log transactions to help combat fraud. Stellar is an open-source payments network focused on reducing poverty in the developing world. It says its lumens - which work using blockchain technology - make monetary transactions cheaper, quicker and more reliable. According to CoinMarketCap, a site that ranks the value of different crypto-currencies, there is $11.6bn worth of Stellar Lumen in circulation. That is far less than the top virtual currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are thought to be worth $240.3bn and $127.4bn respectively. In 2016, the price of bitcoin fell more than 10% after the Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange Bitfinex said it had suffered a major hack. The security breach led to the possible theft of bitcoin worth $65m (£49m). And in 2017 hackers targeted the Bithumb exchange in South Korea, taking millions of dollars' worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The personal information of 30,000 people was also stolen in the attack, which was credited to North Korea.\0.8123791813850403,0.04880337417125702,-0.036816325038671494,0.20983503758907318,0.1357935518026352,-0.7341436147689819,-0.9955453872680664,-0.19243060052394867,-0.07665681838989258,-0.10724713653326035,-0.4269314706325531,0.12012223899364471,0.5417336821556091,-0.7552928924560547,0.8434562087059021,-0.5035666227340698,-0.23786072432994843,-0.5023694634437561,0.9869788885116577,0.5456886887550354,1.2814382314682007,-1.0100129842758179,0.3957948386669159,0.9856995344161987,0.08771736919879913,0.9027777314186096,-0.6123225688934326,0.200703427195549,0.4891214370727539,0.2549685537815094,0.027836376801133156,-0.07343325763940811,0.19654013216495514,-0.20640021562576294,0.6259498000144958,-1.0475513935089111,0.05886763706803322,-0.02799408882856369,0.71918123960495,0.44662928581237793,0.19352328777313232,-0.7341141700744629,0.24043431878089905,0.2687482237815857,0.03793037310242653,-0.6573019623756409,0.5869912505149841,0.7586454153060913,-1.815609335899353,0.2713238596916199,0.3922111690044403,0.7713459134101868,-0.3092019557952881,1.2350285053253174,1.577347993850708,0.008592593483626842,0.11814334243535995,-0.013836107216775417,-0.003366576973348856,1.6667698621749878,0.6855526566505432,0.03125231713056564,0.647596001625061,-0.6239727735519409,-0.9852125644683838,-0.07653862982988358,1.1978025436401367,1.337096095085144,-0.932597279548645,0.0012083170004189014,0.3010920584201813,0.43143218755722046,-0.3974376916885376,-0.10624847561120987,-0.4927913546562195,-0.005117492284625769,-0.7099378705024719,0.4595803916454315,-0.25261953473091125,-0.8569359183311462,-0.49923792481422424,-0.24228228628635406,-0.6725025177001953,0.6292318105697632,0.07482469081878662,-0.5826895833015442,0.5127969980239868,-0.7361525297164917,-0.5831668376922607,-0.15152522921562195,0.5343807339668274,0.373995304107666,-0.27308389544487,-0.016957618296146393,0.3728184401988983,0.2033001333475113,-0.3427106440067291,-0.21312277019023895,-0.7901962995529175,-0.3590438663959503\BBC\Hackers steal $400,000 of crypto-currency\2018-01-15 18:45:15.0\
1870\Technology\An American suspected of making a prank call that led to a fatal shooting has been charged with manslaughter. Tyler Barriss, of Los Angeles, is alleged to have called police in Kansas falsely claiming he was armed and had taken hostages at a home in Wichita. Armed police responded and shot dead the home's unarmed resident, Andrew Finch, while investigating. Mr Barriss is thought to have made the prank call following a row between two gamers playing Call of Duty online. US police said the call was an act of "swatting", where a person makes a false report to send police to another person's home or poses as another person to send police to a fake address. Mr Barriss is alleged to have been asked by one Call of Duty player to "swat" the other. However, when asked for an address the gamer passed on details for Mr Finch's home, which was unconnected to either of the gamers who had fallen out. Police are reportedly still investigating the identities of the two CoD gamers believed to have been involved. Charges levelled at Mr Barriss during the hearing include involuntary manslaughter, giving a false alarm and interference with law enforcement. If convicted, Mr Barriss could face up to 11 years in jail. In an interview with a local news station in Kansas, Mr Barriss said he understood the "magnitude" of what had happened and felt "remorse". "It hasn't just affected my life, it's affected someone's family too," he told the KWCH station. District Attorney Marc Bennett, in Kansas, said he was still investigating the conduct of the officer who had shot Mr Finch.\0.8507822155952454,0.0195588581264019,-0.5904233455657959,0.21520234644412994,0.19244036078453064,0.2590358555316925,0.711853563785553,0.012532823719084263,-1.1699877977371216,-0.354409784078598,-0.5530917644500732,0.7594021558761597,-0.05425695702433586,0.7352893352508545,-0.25406453013420105,0.3222827911376953,-0.0428009107708931,-0.2915281653404236,0.380856990814209,-0.926962673664093,0.7726588249206543,0.022236375138163567,-0.15485955774784088,-0.04228253290057182,-0.5851104259490967,-0.09500926733016968,0.6012946963310242,0.7217490673065186,-0.2305917590856552,-0.1474788337945938,0.5265649557113647,0.6037929058074951,0.36427852511405945,-0.3806818127632141,-0.6101437211036682,-0.2653539180755615,-0.5227552056312561,0.1256476491689682,-0.09420544654130936,-0.4836202561855316,-0.5857592225074768,-1.1557550430297852,0.2358226180076599,-0.3950920104980469,0.3954079747200012,0.04650498926639557,0.335851788520813,0.3449621796607971,-1.116364598274231,-0.1613665372133255,0.37358176708221436,-0.344880610704422,-0.3081664443016052,0.022709868848323822,0.8444286584854126,-0.6216506958007812,-0.10484997928142548,0.3207797408103943,-0.8322679400444031,0.40511706471443176,-0.2890523076057434,-0.006562703754752874,-0.2458895444869995,-0.2638174295425415,-0.6332290172576904,0.5359199643135071,0.7330734729766846,1.5556955337524414,-0.9137716293334961,0.8849305510520935,0.8704289793968201,0.08167062699794769,-0.5683943033218384,0.8913254141807556,-0.5568838715553284,-0.11154758185148239,-0.39978957176208496,0.4559580683708191,-0.22986939549446106,-0.47476136684417725,0.12430140376091003,0.5628672242164612,-0.20444095134735107,0.49935734272003174,0.8616287112236023,0.5998463034629822,-0.038057342171669006,1.0732814073562622,0.14081987738609314,0.08741774410009384,0.2786692976951599,0.9331561326980591,-1.107177495956421,-0.3596523106098175,-0.4724004864692688,0.12315871566534042,-0.41742363572120667,-1.0680129528045654,-1.1754175424575806,-0.5075781345367432\BBC\American charged over deadly 'swatting' raid\2018-01-15 12:56:42.0\
1871\Technology\European planemaker Airbus has said it will stop making its A380 "superjumbo" if it does not get any more orders. Sales director John Leahy said Airbus would have to halt the programme if the plane's main customer, Dubai's Emirates airline, did not place another order. "But I'm hopeful that we work out a deal with Emirates," Mr Leahy added. Sir Tim Clark. president of Emirates Airline, told the BBC: "We remain optimistic that a deal can be concluded." Airbus said Emirates was probably the only airline to have the ability to take a minimum of six planes a year for a period of eight to 10 years. Airbus's comments came as it revealed that had received more orders for planes than Boeing last year, the fifth year in a row that it has beaten its US rival. The pan-European firm said it had booked 1,109 aircraft orders and a record 718 deliveries last year. US rival Boeing booked 912 orders and 763 deliveries. Airbus chief operating officer Fabrice Bregier said overall deliveries could rise to 800 this year, thanks to the increased pace of production of its medium-haul A320neo aircraft. He said deliveries of the A320neo were slowed last year because of problems with the plane's engines, but these issues were now being resolved. The A380 project was first conceived in the early 1990s as an eventual successor to the Boeing 747, with development work beginning in earnest in 1993. The plane has twin decks of seats, and is designed to incorporate amenities such as bars, lounges, beauty salons and duty-free shops, according to customer specification. There have been a total of 317 orders for the the world's largest passenger airliner since its launch in 2007. The Airbus A380 made its debut commercial flight in October that year with Singapore Airlines flying from Singapore to Sydney. Qantas took orders of the plane in 2008, flying the route between Melbourne and Los Angeles. Air France and Lufthansa have also flown the Airbus A380, but its largest customer over the years has been Emirates.\0.1557300090789795,0.03997141495347023,0.09031623601913452,-1.0352517366409302,-0.5108822584152222,0.6289083957672119,0.9750604629516602,-0.903744101524353,-0.7844387888908386,-0.7325856685638428,-0.12820938229560852,-0.18236899375915527,0.2853255569934845,0.07473773509263992,-0.7494339942932129,0.8629390597343445,-0.4317174553871155,-0.2247045487165451,0.04748515039682388,0.1877877414226532,-0.08503305912017822,0.030875323340296745,0.3793126046657562,-0.664915144443512,0.45224687457084656,0.37232905626296997,-0.6985280513763428,0.540147066116333,0.06269139796495438,0.334374338388443,-0.18871140480041504,-0.5611595511436462,-0.43152716755867004,-0.7636113166809082,-0.7119601368904114,-1.3024500608444214,0.2712574899196625,-1.3925833702087402,0.19663681089878082,1.2997678518295288,-0.9913014769554138,0.03299954533576965,0.2017027735710144,0.5393599271774292,-0.29723501205444336,0.5310518741607666,0.9126545786857605,0.7421228289604187,-1.8257768154144287,0.062318626791238785,0.7577403783798218,-0.05590834841132164,-0.4576396048069,-0.07235836982727051,0.500503659248352,0.4444865882396698,0.747530996799469,0.448137491941452,-0.8452066779136658,0.9356098771095276,1.5239001512527466,0.021242646500468254,0.05218973755836487,-0.04988810047507286,-0.057965654879808426,0.5046746730804443,0.11979285627603531,0.2558392882347107,-0.4057237505912781,0.05189012736082077,0.16872461140155792,-0.2953565716743469,-1.0087276697158813,0.35351723432540894,0.31007203459739685,0.3882009983062744,-0.04999469593167305,0.16161656379699707,-0.42058080434799194,0.4078509509563446,0.051847346127033234,0.03269290551543236,0.5280656814575195,0.693487286567688,0.5376619100570679,-0.23407196998596191,0.7649393081665039,-0.08963622152805328,0.7515151500701904,0.7267810702323914,0.2583346366882324,0.6958325505256653,-0.3886002004146576,0.666368842124939,-0.4828003942966461,-0.12291658669710159,-0.38660070300102234,-0.6193864941596985,0.4047011137008667,0.24350708723068237\BBC\Airbus says A380 superjumbo production could end\2018-01-15 13:52:28.0\
1872\Technology\Malware that displays explicit pornographic adverts has been found lurking in 60 apps available on Google's Play store. Many of the apps infected with the malware are aimed at children, and some have been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times. The malware also promotes fake security programs and tries to get people to sign up to expensive services. Google said it had now removed all the compromised apps from the Play store. The "AdultSwine" malware was discovered by researchers from CheckPoint software, which said apps harbouring the code had been downloaded at least three million times. Infected apps include add-ons for the hugely popular pocket edition of Minecraft as well as apps themed around well known Disney characters. The CheckPoint researchers uncovered the infected apps as well as the infrastructure used to pipe offensive adverts and other offers to victims. Reviews of infected apps on Google's store warned about the presence of the pop-up adverts. CheckPoint said AdultSwine was a "nasty nuisance" that was "most certainly damaging on both an emotional and financial level". In a statement, Google said the compromised apps had been purged from the Play store and it had shut down the accounts of the developers that had created them. It added that it would "continue to show strong warnings to anyone that has installed them".\0.6797555685043335,0.14117400348186493,-0.013083311729133129,-0.17654825747013092,0.15024280548095703,0.13976570963859558,-0.2614099085330963,-0.07036944478750229,-0.859938383102417,0.04647064581513405,-0.007410131394863129,0.5349534153938293,-0.3459990322589874,-0.3295224905014038,0.5021972060203552,-0.24560506641864777,0.03571687638759613,0.3510921597480774,0.6832951903343201,0.31304553151130676,0.5527225136756897,-0.028325295075774193,-0.35565677285194397,-0.1587018370628357,-0.4226134419441223,-0.13529467582702637,0.6082006692886353,0.09573258459568024,0.1599835455417633,-0.21572820842266083,-0.22495585680007935,-0.32862645387649536,-0.2997364103794098,0.0527508519589901,0.0568256750702858,-1.0049958229064941,0.17745715379714966,-0.079411081969738,-0.36379560828208923,0.5702865123748779,0.14598365128040314,-0.1843818873167038,0.1714051514863968,-0.20382271707057953,0.04060763120651245,0.3919224143028259,0.18371982872486115,-0.0905926451086998,-1.5630584955215454,-0.2602064609527588,0.8300667405128479,-0.1889587938785553,-0.7899350523948669,0.4021624028682709,0.07903881371021271,-0.46479666233062744,0.8028159737586975,0.1439485251903534,-0.10050076246261597,0.315320760011673,-0.018527230247855186,-0.6772368550300598,-0.9438398480415344,0.5547828078269958,-0.3330046832561493,-0.602911651134491,0.5419781804084778,1.2338768243789673,-0.7482749223709106,-0.19844993948936462,0.1255394071340561,-0.9478500485420227,-0.5275115966796875,-0.6943766474723816,-0.06617216020822525,-0.3427722752094269,0.47751176357269287,0.822974681854248,-1.1696635484695435,-0.2306728959083557,0.33248651027679443,-0.3904983401298523,-0.04883075878024101,0.08100447058677673,-0.025857163593173027,-0.035142701119184494,-0.15169315040111542,0.13135814666748047,0.42118319869041443,0.029606467112898827,0.4197368323802948,0.5256438255310059,-0.11419686675071716,0.5285513997077942,0.042140405625104904,-0.165719673037529,0.568751871585846,-0.36516815423965454,-0.7571418881416321,0.8952853679656982\BBC\Malware populates children's apps with porn adverts\2018-01-15 13:57:47.0\
1873\Technology\Thousands of parents in England are struggling to get subsidised childcare as they grapple with a glitchy website eight months after it was set up. In some cases, money meant for fees has become stuck in tax-free childcare accounts, leaving some parents unable to pay their nursery bills. Others struggled to apply for or reconfirm their free childcare. The government says that fewer than 2% of the 320,000 parents who have opened accounts had encountered problems. It added that earlier teething problems had been put right with extra resources and insists the website is running smoothly for the majority of parents. But nursery and pre-school organisations say thousands of parents have experienced major problems using the HMRC-run website. They have had to devote hours to helping parents resolve issues through repeated calls to the telephone helpline, they say. And many parents have ended up relying on the goodwill of nursery bosses to keep looking after their children while they work, until compensation payments are forthcoming. It comes after problems in the spring and summer when parents struggled to claim eligibility for either the 30 hours scheme for three and four-year-olds or the tax-free childcare - the government's two key schemes aimed at making childcare more affordable. Debbie Raylan, a volunteer administrator at a nursery in Nantwich, said she had been supporting parents who had money locked in tax-free accounts and who were unable to reconfirm their right to claim free childcare. "One lady I helped, had to make over 100 phone calls, literally, to get the problem sorted. "This lady was looking at either giving up her job or finding someone else to look after her children. This is real life, it impacts on people." One mother of two, Kathleen Shields, told the BBC her children's tax-free accounts had been wiped, and that helpline staff could not say when they would be up and running again. Although, she was able to withdraw the funds she had paid in, she has been left more then £400 out of pocket for only two months' childcare costs as the government top-up cannot be received in the account. "I would like to voice my disappointment," she said, "and highlight how difficult this makes things for hardworking families - mine and the countless others impacted by this." She is claiming compensation. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said she had heard from too many members for these issues to be confined to "teething troubles". "It is causing ongoing problems," she said. "Too many nurseries are saying they have parents who are struggling both to register and reconfirm their eligibility, something they must do every three months." She said it had taken months for many nurseries themselves to register, with one taking more than a year to have its details approved. "Here, the parents who had signed up for tax-free childcare were unable to use this towards their child's place at that nursery." One of the key issues causing problems currently seems to be linked to the three-monthly reconfirmation. In order to secure the government subsidy for the term that has just started, parents were required to reconfirm by 31 December. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said: "It's incredibly disappointing that the long-running problems with the government's Childcare Service still haven't been resolved. "This is an IT system meant to support a flagship government policy and yet, more than eight months after its launch, we are still hearing reports of parents who cannot do the simplest things. "This is understandably causing much anger and frustration, something not helped by the government's insistence that all is fine with the website despite a wealth of evidence to the contrary. "The government must get a grip on this problem once and for all, and ensure that the system it is asking parents to use is actually fit for purpose." Ms Tanuku added that her organisation had been flagging up these issues on a regular basis with HMRC and attending advisory meetings regularly. "Despite reassurances from the HMRC, these complaints are too commonplace and we are sure this is the tip of the iceberg." Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said problems seem to persist with the website despite HMRC saying it had resolved things. "We've launched an inquiry into childcare, part of which will focus on the impact of these failures on the take-up of government initiatives that aim to make childcare affordable." An HMRC spokesperson said: "More than 250,000 parents have successfully reconfirmed their eligibility. Almost all parents receive a response within five working days, and most get their decision instantly. "If any parent is having a problem reconfirming or needs to speak to us, they should call us on 0300 123 4097." or\1.9083542823791504,0.5990889668464661,-0.8303102254867554,-0.9081302881240845,0.2552664279937744,-0.11874573677778244,0.7488464117050171,-0.3666013479232788,-0.8074323534965515,0.2623698115348816,1.4946856498718262,1.419010043144226,-0.571074366569519,-0.379392147064209,0.7819371223449707,0.34269747138023376,-0.05522410571575165,0.40186476707458496,0.23797819018363953,-0.8450537919998169,0.4534662961959839,-1.0574241876602173,-0.013931884430348873,0.1565803587436676,0.24490807950496674,1.2421026229858398,0.4881949722766876,-0.5179452896118164,-0.25581303238868713,0.5408921241760254,0.2045823335647583,0.18095706403255463,1.1142503023147583,0.08514297753572464,-0.03862849995493889,-0.1800716519355774,0.23098118603229523,-0.6907915472984314,0.5203255414962769,-1.2445074319839478,-0.03914954513311386,-0.36152344942092896,-0.5784662365913391,0.2911539077758789,-0.578682541847229,-0.3385816514492035,1.205284833908081,0.6489168405532837,-0.6624088883399963,0.2302732914686203,0.5894486308097839,-0.2880725860595703,-0.030358871445059776,0.2174665629863739,-0.10384174436330795,-1.2749472856521606,1.3138313293457031,-0.2575555145740509,0.38467922806739807,0.5873663425445557,-0.17050626873970032,-0.004875187762081623,2.0132181644439697,0.3421591818332672,-0.3731018602848053,1.013340711593628,0.11708598583936691,1.8292945623397827,-0.38387414813041687,1.2469977140426636,1.5755921602249146,0.42013680934906006,-1.0094096660614014,0.16154906153678894,-0.29065021872520447,-0.1546778529882431,-0.23635233938694,1.1526561975479126,-1.3329980373382568,-1.8131752014160156,-0.532517671585083,-0.9940752387046814,-1.011631965637207,0.06935320049524307,0.18668101727962494,-0.032050713896751404,-0.40559718012809753,0.5660714507102966,-0.5361896753311157,-0.13516876101493835,-0.7016652226448059,-0.06890575587749481,-0.5447757244110107,-0.07554342597723007,-0.9017109274864197,1.054310917854309,0.3085213303565979,-0.13983292877674103,-1.410138487815857,0.670404314994812\BBC\Thousands struggle to access childcare on glitchy website\2018-01-15 02:26:34.0\
1874\Technology\Japanese giant Softbank is planning to list its mobile phone business in Tokyo and overseas, according to the Nikkei newspaper. The listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and possibly in London aims to raise 2 trillion yen ($18bn; £13.1bn). Softbank confirmed in a statement that the share sale was an option, but said no decision has yet been made. If it goes ahead, the stock market listing would be one of Japan's biggest initial public offerings. The Softbank Group reportedly intends to sell about 30% of the outstanding shares in its subsidiary to investors, while keeping a stake of around 70%. The firm is considering raising funds from overseas investors, possibly via a stock market listing in London. "We are always studying various capital strategy options", the statement said. "The listing of Softbank Corp. shares is one such option, but no decision has been made to officially proceed with this course". According to the Nikkei, the share sale could rival that of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in 1987. Softbank would use the proceeds to invest in growth, such as buying into foreign information-technology companies, the Nikkei said. The Japanese telecommunications giant is one of the world's biggest technology companies and is run by its founder, Japanese entrepreneur Masayoshi Son. Softbank has made a series of high-profile tech investments and shown an appetite for investments in ride-sharing, backing China's Didi Chuxing and Southeast Asian taxi-hailing app Grab, among other companies. The firm is also set to take a large stake in Uber, expanding its holdings in transportation companies around the world. It previously acquired Vodafone's Japanese operations and the US telecoms company Sprint. In 2016, Softbank bought UK technology firm ARM Holdings for £24bn ($32bn).\0.0992857962846756,0.06616149842739105,0.5627043843269348,-0.29522135853767395,0.395402729511261,0.07206281274557114,-0.23666977882385254,-0.5124187469482422,-0.7315303087234497,0.2883049249649048,-0.6077828407287598,-0.15061724185943604,-0.15728804469108582,0.010702988132834435,-0.4987282454967499,-0.7743676900863647,-0.5208962559700012,0.11392621695995331,0.21426862478256226,-0.03142476826906204,0.27608978748321533,-0.5209750533103943,-0.4002165198326111,0.5288739800453186,0.16061252355575562,0.3557865023612976,0.4939621090888977,0.051576659083366394,0.16125647723674774,0.006950790993869305,0.25488772988319397,-0.7142854928970337,-0.021514523774385452,-0.5827215909957886,0.11440876871347427,-0.3857976198196411,-0.3643918037414551,0.09133469313383102,0.5595967769622803,0.4934602677822113,0.11172664165496826,0.10822790116071701,0.8943638801574707,-0.11874685436487198,0.08506197482347488,0.02531222254037857,-0.07680454850196838,0.9965023994445801,0.4378565549850464,0.6380055546760559,-0.26303189992904663,-0.14133675396442413,-0.4714539051055908,0.9006776809692383,0.26699957251548767,-0.5343289971351624,-0.13412298262119293,0.9741606116294861,-1.138432502746582,-0.6865962147712708,0.25246939063072205,0.42854955792427063,0.41109588742256165,0.062456872314214706,-0.5968680381774902,-7.072206935845315E-4,0.1831522434949875,0.5490816831588745,0.3813718557357788,0.34603095054626465,-0.5784627795219421,-0.33021584153175354,0.3384658396244049,-0.17046502232551575,0.9906731843948364,-0.02277875877916813,-0.9788230061531067,-0.8467767238616943,-0.13998842239379883,-1.227068305015564,-0.10677354037761688,0.06605875492095947,0.27920296788215637,0.5812662243843079,0.7073401808738708,0.01538490317761898,0.35723355412483215,-0.2714841961860657,-0.7056480050086975,0.34923166036605835,-0.732265055179596,-0.17341336607933044,0.9873960018157959,1.1151694059371948,-0.3350231349468231,-0.37569084763526917,0.06360640376806259,0.30685508251190186,-0.08294364809989929,-0.3599136471748352\BBC\Softbank plans $18bn share sale of its mobile business\2018-01-15 02:05:04.0\
1875\Technology\Health data has provided crucial evidence at a trial in Germany, in which a refugee is accused of rape and murder. Apple's Health App accurately records steps and has been pre-installed on the iPhone 6S and newer models. Data suggesting the suspect was climbing stairs could correlate to him dragging his victim down a riverbank and climbing back up, police said. The accused - Hussein K - has admitted his guilt but disputed some details. The 19-year-old medical student Maria Ladenburger was murdered in October 2016 and the trial - at the district court in Freiburg - started in September. Ms Ladenburger was raped and drowned in the River Dresiam. The suspect - identified by a hair found at the scene of the crime - refused to provide police with the PIN code to his phone so investigating officers turned to an unnamed cyber-forensics firm in Munich, which broke into the device. The health data app on iPhones records activity - including how many steps are taken, nutrition and sleep patterns as well as various body measurements such as heart rate. As well as locating Hussein's movements, the phone also suggested periods of more strenuous activity, including two peaks, which the app put down to him "climbing stairs". An investigator of similar build to the suspect went to the area where the body was found and recreated how the police believe he disposed of the body. The police officer's movement data on the same app showed him also "climbing stairs". "For the first time, we correlated health and geo-data," chief of police Peter Egetemaier told the court, according to German paper Die Welt. Complicating the trial are attempts to pin down Hussein's real age. He initially claimed that he was 17 but his father, tracked down to Iran, has disputed this. Age will play a part in sentencing. The maximum for someone under 18 is 10 years, whereas the adult sentence for such a crime could be up to 30 years.\0.09162336587905884,-0.3962527811527252,-0.7942940592765808,-0.4974783658981323,0.2630678117275238,0.5704442858695984,0.19547541439533234,0.37642988562583923,-1.2306578159332275,-0.3421432077884674,-0.09621712565422058,0.45704689621925354,0.671474277973175,0.4226614236831665,-0.6333677172660828,0.28149962425231934,0.5727543830871582,-0.04455839470028877,-0.19548562169075012,0.204276904463768,0.6679641008377075,-0.055732112377882004,-0.1479649394750595,0.06403519958257675,-0.09252394735813141,0.603809654712677,0.8179379105567932,0.03797254338860512,0.04709670692682266,0.20864279568195343,0.44387999176979065,-0.016922133043408394,-0.439041405916214,0.6819594502449036,0.03535553067922592,-0.7786992192268372,0.7312453389167786,0.25905969738960266,0.563997209072113,-1.3973064422607422,-0.545155942440033,-0.10307897627353668,0.38294312357902527,0.06846707314252853,0.1350984126329422,-0.03339720517396927,0.4366164803504944,-0.5570588111877441,-1.0225824117660522,-0.44975608587265015,0.2954923212528229,-0.9163059592247009,-0.17669564485549927,-0.2672625482082367,0.8034851551055908,-0.5659157633781433,0.2728916108608246,0.6292277574539185,-0.6707262992858887,1.092426061630249,-0.06278610229492188,-0.14116893708705902,0.11605657637119293,-0.4617820680141449,-0.17515890300273895,0.2675691843032837,0.18694941699504852,1.1841140985488892,-0.5955379605293274,0.5601037740707397,0.4616805613040924,0.13491608202457428,0.7450329065322876,0.55399090051651,-0.8870211839675903,0.26978662610054016,0.1172523945569992,-0.16345340013504028,-0.09440784156322479,-0.10057571530342102,0.41717031598091125,1.087697148323059,-0.3994492292404175,-0.23357248306274414,0.5281184911727905,0.2053644359111786,0.8438084125518799,0.42391738295555115,-0.21987789869308472,-0.6944800615310669,-0.645901620388031,0.8434292674064636,-0.775601863861084,0.3489389717578888,0.26222488284111023,0.2570325434207916,0.2613355219364166,-0.5555391311645508,-0.19220975041389465,-0.3370220959186554\BBC\Apple health data used in murder trial\2018-01-12 13:56:55.0\
1876\Technology\Snapchat's redesign, which was rolled out at the end of last year, has not gone down well with users. The refreshed look pushed out in the UK, Australia and Canada has proved unpopular, with up to 83% of reviews on the App Store being negative. Many have complained that feeds are no longer chronological and are confusing. Some have contacted Snapchat support on Twitter to air frustrations and asking it to return to the previous version of the app. One user, Leaya Reinhardt, tweeted: Mary Principato tweeted: Tech news site TechCrunch reported that data provided to it by analytics firm Sensor Tower showed that only 17% gave it three to five stars, suggesting they approved of it. Snapchat made the changes as a way for the social network to monetise its service by mixing in more adverts, said experts. Elyse Betters Picaro, US editor of Pocket-lint and a regular user, said Snapchat had "begun mixing ad-laden Stories into your chats now, because, as the numbers have shown, people are sending tonnes of snaps a day now, but they aren't posting to their stories as much. "Stories from your "normal" friends now appear in chats, while famous and popular Snapchat users are still on the side with the media, which appears to create a sort of class system. "It's also difficult to find stories from people who don't follow you back," she said. "Also stories are no longer in chronological order, and you can't play all the stories consecutively anymore." Ms Betters Picaro added: "It may, as a user, feel like you're missing out on something now, as it's harder to find Stories, harder to play them, and they're just seemingly harder to grasp in general now." She added that Snapchat boss Evan Spiegel had warned users and investors about the change in November when he said: "There is a strong likelihood that the redesign of our application will be disruptive to our business in the short term, and we don't yet know how the behaviour of our community will change when they begin to use our updated application." Despite the poor reception, Ms Betters Picaro does not believe the firm will respond to user requests and ditch the changes. She said: "Unfortunately, people tend to be resistant to change. And this update will take some getting used to, whether you're a fan or not. "However, I highly doubt Snap will immediately reverse course due to bad reviews from a limited test in the UK and Canada. After all, it hasn't even hit the US yet." A spokesperson for Snapchat said: "Updates as big as this one can take a little getting used to, but we hope the community will enjoy it once they settle in."\0.668189525604248,-0.20139607787132263,-0.21222497522830963,0.14050599932670593,0.012288377620279789,0.5440428256988525,0.4474109411239624,-0.669132649898529,0.03668469190597534,-0.09770039469003677,0.45342403650283813,0.6371851563453674,0.15600132942199707,0.44385048747062683,0.16028088331222534,-0.5364791750907898,0.29187849164009094,0.37201136350631714,0.2435435801744461,-0.32841065526008606,0.7771087884902954,-0.12616607546806335,0.5932365655899048,-0.8207702040672302,-0.48549020290374756,0.26161009073257446,0.2418234646320343,-0.0035427920520305634,0.2584567070007324,0.9377021193504333,0.1762777715921402,0.375322550535202,0.4660404920578003,-0.03112897276878357,-0.021346939727663994,-0.06893672049045563,0.21155771613121033,0.27514007687568665,0.49027153849601746,-0.003402880160138011,-0.7845666408538818,-1.3201245069503784,0.7236126065254211,0.29268744587898254,-0.3690544068813324,-0.2188786417245865,1.0215089321136475,0.5584572553634644,-0.8928868770599365,-0.6300374269485474,0.789863109588623,-0.15140347182750702,-0.5585251450538635,-0.5202474594116211,0.06140267848968506,-0.6684460043907166,-0.030428433790802956,0.49210625886917114,0.24345295131206512,-0.37781986594200134,0.3793674111366272,-0.6799694299697876,0.7056488990783691,-0.12174853682518005,0.13381844758987427,-0.5407816171646118,-0.37017446756362915,1.5143766403198242,-0.5287758111953735,0.22285014390945435,0.31480106711387634,0.15805546939373016,-1.0187312364578247,0.12874743342399597,-0.6856985688209534,0.5433667302131653,-0.47385385632514954,0.5841038823127747,-0.45347142219543457,-0.5871920585632324,0.4034133553504944,-0.4912452697753906,0.07180080562829971,0.6572121381759644,-0.20958997309207916,0.16210147738456726,1.2637649774551392,0.8853639960289001,-0.9256564974784851,-0.03618469834327698,-0.6899837255477905,0.02587030827999115,-0.20898392796516418,0.4245275855064392,-0.8264977931976318,0.7223452925682068,0.09405259788036346,-0.33530697226524353,-1.105456829071045,0.2838885188102722\BBC\Snapchat redesign is a 'flop' with users\2018-01-12 17:25:19.0\
1877\Technology\Facebook is to change how its news feed works, making posts from businesses, brands and media less prominent. Instead, content that sparks conversations among family and friends who use the site will be emphasised, explained chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on his page. Organisations on Facebook may see the popularity of their posts decrease as a result, the firm acknowledged. The changes will take effect over the coming weeks. "We've gotten feedback from our community that public content - posts from businesses, brands and media - is crowding out the personal moments that lead us to connect more with each other," wrote Mr Zuckerberg. He said that he and his team felt a responsibility to make sure Facebook was good for people's wellbeing. If public content is to be promoted, it will now have to be seen to encourage community interaction - as happens within the tight-knit groups that discuss TV programmes and sports, he said. Another example given by Facebook in a separate post was live video feeds, which tend to generate much discussion. "By making these changes, I expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down," added Mr Zuckerberg. "But I also expect the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable." In a previous post, Mr Zuckerberg had vowed to "fix" Facebook in 2018, saying he wanted to ensure that users were protected from abuse and that time spent on the site would be time well spent. He also pledged to defend Facebook from nation states. Analysis has recently suggested that some actors, including Russia, have tried to manipulate content on the social network. "It's definitely a significant change," said Laura Hazard Owen at Harvard University's Nieman Journalism Lab. "It's going to affect publishers a lot, we're going to be seeing a lot less news organically pop up in our news feeds." Ms Owen added, however, that Facebook had not been very clear about what sort of discussions the site's revamped algorithms would prioritise. It might end up being "the most controversial stuff" that generates heated conversations, she suggested, or simply content pulled in from group pages where users engage with others on specific topics. Given recent public scrutiny, the social network was currently "in the hot seat", said Gabriel Kahn from the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. "Facebook is in the midst of all of these fires it's trying to put out, it's trying to reassert its warm and fuzzy brand value that it has always tried to put forth," he told the BBC. Mr Kahn added the update from Mr Zuckerberg was a "clear admission" that Facebook wielded significant power over the health of society. However, he argued that the new priorities could further distort views and the nature of conversations. "There should be public debate about the values they're applying to that algorithm," he said. In many ways this is Facebook getting back to its roots, making your news feed more about what your friends are creating and thinking, rather than articles they have shared. For the first time, Mark Zuckerberg is making a major decision that goes against one of his long-held beliefs: any change to the network must have the goal of improving engagement. This move, he concedes, will likely lead to people spending less time on the site. But after a tough 2017, Mr Zuckerberg is perhaps learning now that in the wake of the fake news scandal, and a platform brimming with tedious clickbait, not all engagement is good engagement. Faced with the enormous task of having to do more to moderate what's happening on his network, Mr Zuckerberg may have come to the conclusion that having a news free-for-all is becoming more trouble than it's worth. For news organisations and publications, this might spell bad news: a lot of traffic comes from Facebook. With less prominence, expect some viral sites to very quickly go out of business. The new change of course will cost Facebook money. Mr Zuckerberg warned investors at the end of last year that combating fake news would hurt the firm's bottom line.

1878\Technology\China has shut down the Chinese websites of Marriott International for a week, after the firm listed Tibet and others as separate countries. The hotel group has apologised for the error and said it did not support separatist movements in China. Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau were listed as individual nations in an online survey sent to customers. Beijing considers self-ruling Taiwan to be a breakaway province and Tibet is governed as an autonomous region. Hong Kong and Macau are both special administrative regions of China. Marriott was also chastised after one of the firm's social media accounts "liked" a post made by a group supporting a separatist Tibet. Chinese media is reporting that some travellers are cancelling Marriott reservations in response. China is usually quick to respond to any actions or statements it deems supportive of separatist movements, especially related to Tibet and Taiwan. While the hotel's international website is still available within China, the Shanghai Cyberspace Administration ordered it to close a Mandarin version. Authorities also shut down Marriott's Chinese mobile phone app as part of its punishment for the Mandarin-language survey. But having being closed earlier, the app now appears to be functioning. On Thursday the hotel group's chief executive Arne Sorenson issued an apology, saying his firm "respects and supports Chinese sovereignty and its territorial integrity". "We don't support anyone who subverts the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China and we do not intend in any way to encourage or incite any such people or groups," Mr Sorenson said. "Unfortunately, twice this week, we had incidents that suggested the opposite." The statement added that the company would take "necessary" disciplinary action against staff involved, which may include termination. Mr Sorenson has previously described China as his firm's biggest market. While Marriott has over 100 hotels in the country under different brands, it is also keen to profit from the swelling number of Chinese people travelling internationally. Last year it launched a joint travel venture with China's ecommerce giant Alibaba.\0.44043630361557007,0.659675657749176,0.2814761996269226,-0.1024443581700325,0.09684184193611145,-0.6080897450447083,1.1471658945083618,-1.0787246227264404,-0.9376248121261597,-0.5436804294586182,0.4718845784664154,0.40305355191230774,0.19525007903575897,0.3117387890815735,-0.01002435851842165,-0.33446362614631653,-0.9735720157623291,0.12620054185390472,0.34667065739631653,0.3776949942111969,0.12032753229141235,-0.23883311450481415,0.20312367379665375,0.1208534836769104,0.38900724053382874,-0.5568372011184692,-0.6452915668487549,-0.11851203441619873,0.10104716569185257,0.15754680335521698,0.03219347819685936,0.2932361364364624,-0.018788494169712067,0.0965031161904335,0.614434540271759,-0.011583519168198109,0.9288346767425537,0.5681890249252319,-0.20008806884288788,0.16496038436889648,-0.8711886405944824,-0.670403778553009,0.31813839077949524,-0.011806055903434753,-1.1470799446105957,-0.07337930053472519,0.6912170052528381,0.4481656551361084,-1.6293224096298218,-0.7262663245201111,0.14051222801208496,-0.3614791929721832,-0.27292388677597046,0.25227218866348267,0.17357103526592255,-0.895161509513855,0.1429762989282608,-0.24103164672851562,-1.7893297672271729,-0.20541012287139893,0.44406837224960327,-0.7932184338569641,-0.0404878593981266,0.42272070050239563,-1.0167347192764282,-0.36265626549720764,0.5657530426979065,0.2673172950744629,0.6882278919219971,-0.12931351363658905,-0.5671575665473938,0.2650652825832367,-0.18746207654476166,-0.34940022230148315,0.030790789052844048,-1.3663872480392456,0.10945656895637512,-1.4520771503448486,-0.47388893365859985,-1.0485584735870361,0.9597558975219727,0.5975440740585327,-0.575030505657196,1.0282814502716064,0.45891404151916504,0.7402049899101257,0.615739643573761,0.22872421145439148,0.36788487434387207,0.9967309832572937,-0.15767405927181244,-0.1189659908413887,-0.06251511722803116,0.7618155479431152,0.08456483483314514,-0.2299818992614746,0.5187847018241882,0.1070742979645729,-0.8257165551185608,0.753046452999115\BBC\China shuts Marriott's website over Tibet and Taiwan error\2018-01-12 04:38:33.0\
1879\Technology\The European Commission has unveiled plans to spend 1bn euros creating "world class" supercomputers. The project was needed, it said, because European contributions to existing high-performance computing projects was "insignificant". The cash will be spent developing machines that carry out a billion billion calculations per second. The world's current fastest supercomputers are about a thousand times slower than this target. The Commission said the machines would boost future industrial prosperity and pointed to existing machines that had helped car makers speed up production. "Supercomputers are the engine to power the digital economy," said Andrus Ansip, EC vice-president for the digital single market. "It is a tough race and today the EU is lagging behind." In a statement laying out its plans, the Commission said initial work would concentrate on developing machines that match the computational capacities of the world's most powerful machines. Many of these operate in the so-called petascale range which means they can carry out about a thousand trillion calculations per second. Each calculation is known as a floating point operation or flop. China's Sunway TaihuLight is the world's speediest supercomputer and, at peak performance, can hit 93 petaflops. The four computers that result from this first phase will be made available to businesses and research groups across Europe, said the Commission. They could help prevent disasters, tackle cyber-crime and improve healthcare, it said. Expertise built up in the first phase would help Europe go beyond petaflops for the second stage of its research project and aims, by 2023, to make a machine that can breach the exaflop barrier. China dominates the world supercomputer rankings and currently has 202 machines in the Top 500 list of processing powerhouses. The US has 143 machines in that list and Europe 93. The long-term project also aims to boost European research into high-performance computing and help firms be more involved in the efforts of nations outside the region to create ultra-powerful machines. Currently, said the research project, European HPC projects often had to look elsewhere for expertise and hardware when building its own machines and had an "insignificant" role in global projects.\0.18843674659729004,0.2985675632953644,-0.680887758731842,-0.6300806403160095,0.13555872440338135,0.0031490542460232973,0.1734888255596161,0.4723816514015198,-0.46155643463134766,-0.588606059551239,0.6562595963478088,1.5621882677078247,-0.05836307629942894,0.31524765491485596,0.6914178133010864,-1.086342453956604,-0.8330630660057068,-0.49369341135025024,-0.22525204718112946,0.38521134853363037,-0.19687485694885254,-0.8680545687675476,-0.4494694173336029,-0.361030638217926,0.08361677825450897,0.10484733432531357,-1.0831547975540161,-0.4722263813018799,0.6418799161911011,-0.6561497449874878,-0.4663155674934387,-0.11952908337116241,-1.1120097637176514,0.2565295100212097,-1.2056939601898193,-0.6546584963798523,-0.5953798890113831,-0.6252983808517456,0.7135882377624512,1.4222581386566162,-0.5954622626304626,-0.18034423887729645,-0.19427254796028137,0.299489825963974,0.25029608607292175,1.188537836074829,0.007300235331058502,1.6171058416366577,-1.2517502307891846,-0.2702687680721283,0.5140547156333923,0.1310446709394455,0.04173951596021652,0.9140773415565491,1.294223666191101,-0.19743786752223969,-0.39800843596458435,0.40901464223861694,0.01625446043908596,0.11202666908502579,0.619860827922821,0.1516122817993164,-0.40459081530570984,0.10663080960512161,-1.6827220916748047,-0.12412592768669128,1.0180532932281494,-0.25536105036735535,0.44881463050842285,-0.2139674425125122,0.17019794881343842,0.08362626284360886,-0.35009562969207764,-0.14818063378334045,0.33093971014022827,-0.34765589237213135,-0.7349511981010437,-0.6684153079986572,-0.7845114469528198,-0.5820966362953186,0.4038527309894562,0.9937694668769836,-0.6028174161911011,1.2913696765899658,-0.41463711857795715,-0.07034371793270111,0.6991372108459473,-0.9804168939590454,0.8718379139900208,0.4190330505371094,0.6205642819404602,1.6195820569992065,0.17202885448932648,1.0182087421417236,-0.31501588225364685,0.2626180648803711,0.26407405734062195,0.27719372510910034,-1.028377652168274,0.8487889766693115\BBC\Europe puts 1bn euros into supercomputer research\2018-01-12 12:47:43.0\
1880\Technology\One of America's largest retirement villages will have a fleet of self-driving taxis introduced next year. US firm Voyage said it will start rolling out the service at The Villages, Florida which is home to 125,000 senior residents. It said the scheme, spanning 750 miles of road, would be the "largest by area size" in the world. It comes as safety concerns about self-driving cars persist after testing problems and some accidents. Voyage already operates a handful of driverless taxis at another retirement community in San Jose, California, also called the Villages, but said it had begun testing vehicles in Florida ahead of a much larger roll-out. Once the scheme is fully operational, it said all residents would be able to summon a self-driving car using its mobile app. "[Then they can] travel anywhere within the bounds of the community fully autonomously," it said. The sprawling Villages encompasses three distinct downtown areas, more than 100 dining options, eight major supermarkets and 7.8 million sq ft of commercial real estate. It has also attracted controversy following reports about a raucous nightlife and public displays of debauchery. Most experts agree robot cars will first be deployed as fleets of self-driving taxis in controlled environments such as university campuses, business parks or retirement communities. But some research suggests the elderly are unlikely to trust robot cars. According to a 2016 survey by Kelley Blue Book, a car valuation and research firm, only 9% of those aged 51-64 said they felt confident enough to travel in a fully driverless vehicle, compared with 38% of those aged 12-15. Voyage's self-driving cars aren't fully autonomous: all have safety drivers behind the wheel, who can intervene in an emergency. The firm said it predicts "high demand" from residents and has reportedly given an equity stake in its company to the owners of The Villages. Florida is one of more than 20 US states to have approved the use of autonomous vehicles on its roads. But while experts say self-driving technology could make driving safer, fears about the technology persist. Some vehicle tests have gone awry and computer error was deemed partly to blame in a crash involving a Tesla vehicle last year. On Wednesday, a self-driving car operated by Argo AI, a firm backed by Ford, was involved in a crash in Pittsburgh that led to two people being hospitalised. Early reports suggest the accident was the result of human error. Ford declined to comment on whether the vehicle was in self-driving mode at the time, or whether Argo has stopped testing the cars while it investigates the crash. In an email to tech news site the Verge, it said: "We're aware that an Argo AI test vehicle was involved in an accident. We're gathering all the information. Our initial focus is on making sure that everyone involved is safe."\0.3308188021183014,0.3272849917411804,-0.9507549405097961,0.3413168787956238,-0.19177642464637756,0.30290237069129944,-0.2362590730190277,-0.46263766288757324,-1.312632441520691,0.2766348719596863,0.7638384699821472,0.5444667339324951,0.1269219070672989,-0.4316074848175049,-0.410092294216156,-0.6779950261116028,0.3085753321647644,-0.7124526500701904,0.13755303621292114,-0.28148290514945984,0.1640988439321518,-0.7563470602035522,0.2221968173980713,-0.6866596341133118,0.1931905448436737,-0.27296173572540283,0.7553126811981201,-0.3593725860118866,-0.3477708399295807,0.7554934620857239,-0.9789696335792542,0.5716425776481628,-0.5161137580871582,0.1891695111989975,-0.03022880107164383,-0.5245022773742676,-0.31017449498176575,-0.34396424889564514,0.89370197057724,-0.45057642459869385,0.1120605543255806,-0.8083978295326233,1.1288961172103882,0.021774742752313614,-0.7495571374893188,-0.3544550836086273,-0.19204649329185486,0.5192366242408752,-2.483492612838745,-1.1365371942520142,0.7800964117050171,-0.6908347606658936,0.4642746150493622,0.5050317645072937,0.05143390968441963,-0.0475146621465683,0.3182896673679352,0.6112673878669739,-0.42972272634506226,0.020888542756438255,-0.16766756772994995,0.5058230757713318,-0.07665881514549255,-0.8131973743438721,-0.7042195796966553,-0.009092975407838821,1.4054172039031982,0.18541444838047028,-1.2868503332138062,0.2012462317943573,-0.4649786353111267,0.3101199269294739,0.2796963155269623,-0.4233418405056,1.2600795030593872,-0.9768431782722473,-0.30489668250083923,-0.2175305336713791,-1.0516942739486694,-1.4845198392868042,0.35957303643226624,0.08612502366304398,-1.1164352893829346,0.9434746503829956,-0.2080896496772766,-1.109955072402954,0.6096980571746826,0.3080149292945862,0.32237479090690613,0.4029107391834259,-0.564000129699707,0.584782063961029,-0.569042444229126,1.3775997161865234,0.4877963364124298,-0.15768977999687195,1.5046154260635376,0.649856686592102,-1.0003995895385742,0.9842466711997986\BBC\US retirement village to have 'largest' self-driving taxi scheme\2018-01-11 13:49:54.0\
1881\Technology\An American man has been charged with allegedly spying on thousands of people via their computers for more than a decade. The US Department of Justice accused Philip Durachinsky of creating malware to infiltrate victims' computers. During the campaign, Mr Durachinsky is alleged to have stolen data and secretly recorded images and audio. He has been charged with breaking US laws on fraud, computer abuse and identity theft. In addition, because some of the victims were minors, he has also been charged with producing child pornography. In total, Mr Durachinsky faces 16 separate charges. "Durachinsky is alleged to have utilised his sophisticated cyber-skills with ill intent, compromising numerous systems and individual computers," said FBI special agent Stephen Anthony, who led the investigation. Mr Anthony said many of the organisations that Mr Durachinsky is claimed to have compromised, shared key information with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies helping them uncover who was behind the hack attacks. As well as individuals, Mr Durachinsky is said to have hacked into schools, companies, a police department and a subsidiary of the US Department of Energy. The malware used to penetrate machines, which were predominantly Apple Mac laptops and desktops, is called Fruitfly. It was first identified in early 2017 and left security researchers baffled because it was not clear how the software managed to infect machines. Analysis of the malware and machines it was found on suggest it was first used in 2003. Apple produced a patch to fix the vulnerabilities it exploited in late January last year. Mr Durachinsky was arrested soon after information about Fruitfly was made public.\0.23726920783519745,0.8438894748687744,-0.4439053237438202,-0.12510794401168823,-0.28464189171791077,0.16312141716480255,0.46651384234428406,-0.06802644580602646,-0.34904101490974426,-0.6144866347312927,-0.12505626678466797,0.23675182461738586,-0.7062249779701233,0.11385545134544373,-0.35717228055000305,0.011601755395531654,0.043586909770965576,0.7674802541732788,0.045494940131902695,0.547755777835846,0.7870857119560242,-0.9289531707763672,-0.05075453966856003,0.02868923544883728,-1.097086787223816,-0.09587650001049042,0.5981507301330566,0.49955523014068604,0.869989812374115,-0.0048673623241484165,0.28698235750198364,0.19099359214305878,-1.2899819612503052,-0.8449208736419678,0.42952361702919006,-0.5124486088752747,-0.2696605622768402,-0.2824840843677521,0.11598782241344452,-0.24990981817245483,-0.6367141008377075,-0.7558261752128601,0.25759387016296387,-0.5664146542549133,-0.25905153155326843,-0.4195743501186371,0.2248987853527069,0.36901530623435974,-1.2967876195907593,-0.2921980321407318,0.7846429944038391,0.05659432336688042,-0.16145293414592743,0.012455611489713192,0.9144810438156128,-0.36802607774734497,0.2427908182144165,-0.3704633116722107,-0.2134852558374405,0.5486465096473694,-0.5607030391693115,0.10907284915447235,0.010854898020625114,-0.02035471238195896,-0.14809510111808777,0.564399242401123,1.2128756046295166,0.6936452984809875,-0.8182005286216736,0.28659960627555847,0.39927443861961365,-0.9152705073356628,-0.4635466933250427,0.4035918414592743,0.27228671312332153,0.16909751296043396,0.5925397276878357,-0.234892338514328,-0.8220573663711548,-0.9073032140731812,0.4940820038318634,-0.5458929538726807,-0.03013034723699093,0.2077946960926056,0.4269237816333771,0.12848691642284393,0.26070576906204224,0.1819627732038498,0.7650724649429321,0.23122859001159668,0.2095796763896942,0.37385642528533936,-1.3127952814102173,0.18955887854099274,-0.7297781109809875,0.26645976305007935,-0.4415134787559509,-1.0600342750549316,-0.6634240746498108,-0.0319119431078434\BBC\US man charged over 15-year spying campaign\2018-01-11 12:10:21.0\
1882\Technology\Samsung has announced a giant 146in (396cm) TV called The Wall at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. The TV features a micro-LED display, which is pitched as a superior alternative to OLED because it offers both deep blacks and bright highlights. However, one analyst said they would likely be very expensive to manufacture. Samsung also says its modular technology will allow for TVs of customised sizes to be ordered. This is because the display is actually composed of many smaller modules that can be arranged to form unusual dimensions - one example that was squat and super-wide was briefly shown at the presentation. The micro-LED display, thanks to its self-emitting LEDs, should allow for a bright picture without the need for a backlight. Backlights normally make it hard to produce deep blacks on screen because their illumination spills beyond the pixels they are targeted at. Sony tried to produce TVs made from the same basic technology back in 2012 but they proved too expensive to make en masse. Samsung's decision to bet on micro-LED puts it in direct competition with rivals that have opted to go with OLED displays. More from CES 2018: Micro-LED screens are difficult to manufacture because the LEDs need to be individually placed onto a layer by machines, explained analyst Paul Gray at IHS Technology. "You have millions for a single display," he said. "But maybe Samsung has made some breakthroughs on multiple placement [at once]." Mr Gray added that, although Samsung was pitching the technology as a "consumer" product, it would likely only appear in very expensive devices. Samsung has not yet revealed details on pricing itself. Other options for giant TV displays have been shown off at CES this year. Hisense unveiled a 150in 4K TV projector system that can beam a picture onto its owner's wall. The firm did not announce a price for the product, though a 100in version costs $10,000 (£7,300). And there were TVs with improved brains, too. Samsung promised that its next generation of smart TVs would be more intelligent than ever before, thanks to the inclusion of the firm's voice-activated assistant Bixby. Users can even ask Bixby to display the inside of their fridge on screen - if they have a compatible Samsung smart fridge with internal camera. AI assistants have cropped up several smart TV's at CES this year, including Philips' 7703 Series 24in Android TV, which comes perched on a Bluetooth speaker and is designed for kitchen worktops.

1883\Technology\YouTube has cut some business ties with Logan Paul, the hugely popular vlogger who posted a video showing the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. Paul's channels were removed from YouTube's Google Preferred programme, where brands sell ads on the platform's top 5% of content creators. YouTube also said it had put on hold original projects with the US vlogger. Paul posted the video with a man's body on 31 December, triggering widespread criticism. The video showed Paul and his friends at the Aokigahara forest at the base of Mount Fuji, known to be a frequent site of suicides. Going in to film the "haunted" forest, they come across a man's body and are shocked but also make jokes. The identity of the deceased man is not known. Online comments have called the Japan video, which garnered millions of views on YouTube before it was taken down, "disrespectful" and "disgusting". Paul later posted an apology on Twitter, saying he had been "misguided by shock and awe". He also uploaded a video apology, and said: "I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through." "I'm ashamed of myself," he added. "I'm disappointed in myself." It's hard to calculate exactly. YouTube's move will cost him financially as his videos will no longer earn top-tier cash per click - but as he hasn't been completely kicked off the platform, he will still earn money from views. Google Preferred allows brands to publish ads on the accounts that are most popular among 18-34 year-olds in the US. YouTube's own wording calls it a way for companies to "share their messages alongside some of the most engaging and brand safe content on YouTube". Aside from his videos, Paul makes money from sponsored social media posts and merchandise - and it's worth noting that his apology video has racked up nearly 40 million views. With more than 15 million subscribers and counting, he's huge. Last year, Forbes magazine estimated he made $12.5m (£9.3m), making him the fourth highest-paid YouTube star in 2016. Some people are frustrated that it took YouTube 10 days to respond to the controversy. The company acknowledged this, saying: "You're right to be [frustrated]. You deserve to know what's going on." The Japan video itself was not taken down by YouTube; Paul himself took it down, leading some to complain that the platform should have acted more decisively. Japan has one of the highest rates of suicide in the developed world. Aokigahara forest has a reputation in Japan and internationally as a destination for people who want to kill themselves. Data on the number of suicides there each year is not made public, to avoid publicising the site. Signs are posted in the forest urging people to seek medical help rather than take their lives.

1884\Technology\The giant consumer electronics show CES has suffered a power cut, plunging part of the event into darkness. The Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC)'s central hall went dark at around 11:20 local time (19:20 GMT). Two hours passed before the organisers said that the electricity supply had been restored. They blamed an earlier downpour for causing the blackout, which resulted in attendees being evacuated from the building. The affected space hosts booths for LG, Samsung and Sony among others. BBC reporters at the scene said that security guards had also prevented people from entering the LVCC's North Hall, where car-makers including Toyota, Nissan and Ford have exhibits. The Consumer Technology Association, which runs the event, has thanked visitors for their patience. But some have expressed frustration at having missed meetings. The power failure followed heavy rain on Tuesday, which had forced Google to shut one of its booths located in the LVCC's car park. It had been the city's first rainfall in 116 days, and had marked the wettest January day on record for the area, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal newspaper. One LVCC employee, who asked not to be named, said that the water had affected the "trunk lines" that carry power to the venue. The CTA later issued the following statement, which was released in conjunction with the utility firm NV Energy and the Las Vegas Visitor and Convention Authority. "A preliminary assessment indicates that condensation from heavy rainfall caused a flashover on one of the facility's transformers," it said. "We are grateful to NV Energy for their swift assistance, to our customers and their clients for their patience and to the staff for ensuring the safety and security of all attendees and exhibitors." The trade fair is marketed as the "world's gathering place for all those who thrive on the business of consumer technologies". CES sprawls across many venues close to the Las Vegas Strip, and the CTA had highlighted that most of them had been unaffected. More from CES: At an electronics show, electricity is key. As I write this, the cause of the blackout is not known. But Vegas was pelted with rain this week, and this city just cannot handle it. Roads have flooded, hotels are leaking - including into this reporter's room - and now, potentially, this. Embarrassing for a city that prides itself on being the best equipped for enormous shows like CES. Patience is being tested here. This show isn't just about playing with gadgets, it's about big business. Cancelled meetings might mean deals aren't done. I saw one delegate get irate when he was told he could not go into the main hall for his meeting. "You ain't meeting in the dark, buddy!" the show floor worker told him. With every passing minute, this power cut is costing a lot of people a lot of money.\2.0692050457000732,-1.0323295593261719,-0.6205118894577026,0.4630568027496338,0.4358563721179962,0.6732615232467651,1.737435221672058,0.37665989995002747,-1.3755205869674683,-0.31514856219291687,0.26027604937553406,-0.045298509299755096,-1.016966462135315,0.3960363566875458,-0.7167388200759888,0.34875476360321045,-0.3858533501625061,1.0001060962677002,0.6534962058067322,-0.4329221546649933,0.5210300087928772,0.42515045404434204,0.17510610818862915,-1.2431416511535645,0.4408566355705261,0.3896125257015228,0.4249763786792755,0.5157543420791626,-0.43718788027763367,0.44555315375328064,0.34345659613609314,-0.1376563459634781,0.14386290311813354,-0.06194968521595001,-0.5250129699707031,0.0681043341755867,-0.8819781541824341,-1.0307732820510864,0.5561355948448181,0.09015735983848572,-0.5123105645179749,-0.5623015761375427,0.07811687886714935,-0.8827111124992371,-0.2985084652900696,0.6557236313819885,0.146924689412117,-0.04753784462809563,-0.943367063999176,-0.01343595515936613,0.3001495897769928,0.5034733414649963,-1.8081960678100586,-0.27033478021621704,-0.124663807451725,-0.400798499584198,0.9465922713279724,0.3332762122154236,-0.7477495670318604,1.0002970695495605,-0.24637052416801453,-0.05235149711370468,-1.0787174701690674,0.5189192295074463,-0.3173741102218628,-0.3182637393474579,0.9904465079307556,2.4144582748413086,-0.3177337050437927,0.5091853141784668,0.29005032777786255,1.4788142442703247,0.13417136669158936,0.14832188189029694,-0.4450691342353821,0.7402844429016113,-0.5277891755104065,0.6242393255233765,-0.2538742423057556,-1.5855306386947632,0.27857714891433716,0.014810297638177872,-1.2165595293045044,1.0433977842330933,0.42505210638046265,-0.5294922590255737,0.6045216917991638,0.680268406867981,0.7858343124389648,0.26155948638916016,-0.265869677066803,-0.07773390412330627,-0.6586505770683289,0.5720932483673096,-0.29444798827171326,0.3525143265724182,-0.29060718417167664,-0.4512447416782379,-0.323508083820343,0.7185103297233582\BBC\CES 2018: Power cut at Vegas tech show blamed on rain\2018-01-10 23:14:22.0\
1885\Technology\South Korea is considering a law to ban cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin being traded on local exchanges. Justice Minister Park Sang-ki said virtual currencies were "great concerns" and that the ministry was preparing a bill to ban trading. However, South Korea's presidential office said later that a ban had not yet been finalised and was one measure being considered. The local Bitcoin price fell by a fifth after the justice minister's comments. In South Korea it trades at about a 30% premium compared with other countries. There is no one fixed price for Bitcoin as it is not regulated and is traded on dozens of exchanges worldwide. According to Coindesk.com, the price of Bitcoin was about 8% lower at just under $13,800 on Thursday afternoon. South Korea has become a hotbed for cryptocurrency trading, accounting for about 20% of global Bitcoin transactions. It has more than a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges, according to the Korea Blockchain Industry Association. Several were raided this week in a probe into alleged tax evasion, including the country's second-largest virtual currency operator, Bithumb. The government had already said in December that it would apply more scrutiny to the exchanges, including moves to curb anonymous trading. Given the low levels of trading and relatively small number of people holding virtual currencies, wild price swings have become the norm, leading to an argument that paying too much attention to price rises and falls is futile. Digital currencies such as Bitcoin have surged in value over the past year - driving a huge demand. That has led to concerns about gambling addiction as inexperienced investors try to ride the wave.\0.707172691822052,0.7380949854850769,-0.15339446067810059,-1.2346302270889282,1.0366904735565186,-0.020087439566850662,0.1864079087972641,-0.9481023550033569,-0.20187491178512573,-0.29978740215301514,0.245741069316864,-0.16099458932876587,0.41554751992225647,-0.2506331503391266,-0.7022592425346375,-0.013287828303873539,-0.072696752846241,-0.23079371452331543,-0.12085199356079102,-0.3987298607826233,-0.2937440574169159,-0.7208541035652161,0.21152393519878387,-0.11447935551404953,-0.8845532536506653,0.6588370203971863,-0.48705729842185974,-0.0022747230250388384,-0.4920671880245209,-0.00517525477334857,-0.03886931389570236,-0.4132712781429291,-0.741102397441864,-0.10891548544168472,-0.335110604763031,-0.14910300076007843,0.03309843689203262,-0.40565821528434753,-0.2752128839492798,0.008504969999194145,-0.5300725102424622,-0.45329299569129944,0.05651739612221718,0.1875327229499817,-0.5714860558509827,-0.3109455406665802,-0.28040382266044617,0.46405473351478577,-0.8844406008720398,0.3221665024757385,0.7538498044013977,0.04700900614261627,-0.23152099549770355,1.0907268524169922,0.386111855506897,0.08871212601661682,0.36412546038627625,-0.6298465728759766,0.05314456298947334,0.21813394129276276,0.778893232345581,-0.6833763122558594,0.12285824120044708,0.17554868757724762,-1.1098917722702026,0.12344510108232498,0.23312024772167206,0.39904358983039856,0.11754123121500015,-0.3190732002258301,-0.09818515926599503,0.18203411996364594,-0.16986973583698273,-0.13921470940113068,-0.3677506148815155,-0.09077132493257523,0.5596238970756531,-0.2746184468269348,-0.9477031826972961,-0.18126530945301056,0.5527960062026978,-0.4756424129009247,-0.36891308426856995,0.6940409541130066,0.4789174497127533,-0.09402120858430862,-0.43535879254341125,0.4497077465057373,-0.36222198605537415,0.4260042905807495,0.6639254689216614,-0.0919865146279335,0.018425075337290764,-0.5704926252365112,-0.5114006996154785,-0.11037091165781021,-0.08320309221744537,-0.5143652558326721,0.24380049109458923,0.6217505931854248\BBC\South Korea considers Bitcoin trading ban\2018-01-11 13:31:19.0\
1886\Technology\Police have apologised after giving infected memory sticks as prizes in a government-run cyber-security quiz. Taiwan's national police agency said 54 of the flash drives it gave out at an event highlighting a government's cybercrime crackdown contained malware. The virus, which can steal personal data and has been linked to fraud, was added inadvertently, it said. The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) apologised for the error and blamed the mishap on a third-party contractor. It said 20 of the drives had been recovered. Around 250 flash drives were given out at the expo, which was hosted by Taiwan's Presidential Office from 11-15 December and aimed to highlight the government's determination to crack down on cybercrime. All the drives were manufactured in China but the CIB ruled out state-sponsored espionage, saying instead that the bug had originated from a Taiwan-based supplier. It said a single employee at the firm had transferred data onto 54 of the drives to "test their storage capacity", infecting them in the process. The malware, identified as the XtbSeDuA.exe program, was designed to collect personal data and transmit it to a Polish IP address which then bounces it to unidentified servers. The CIB said it had been used by a cyber-fraud ring uncovered by Europol in 2015. Only older, 32-bit computers are vulnerable to the bug and common anti-virus software can detect and quarantine it, it said. The server involved in the latest infections had been shut down, it said. In May, IBM admitted it had inadvertently shipped malware-infected flash drives to some customers. The computer maker said drives containing its Storwize storage system had been infected with a trojan and urged customers to destroy them.

1887\Technology\Facebook M, a text-based personal assistant launched in beta form in August 2015, is to be killed off. The human-enhanced version of M was made available through a chatbot on Facebook Messenger to a few thousand people in California but was expected to be rolled out to more users. The firm confirmed that the service would not be extended, describing it as an "experiment". One analyst said the service had failed to live up to expectations. A spokesperson for Facebook's Messenger service told the BBC that M was to be axed, saying: "We launched this project to learn what people needed and expected of an assistant, and we learned a lot. "We're taking these useful insights to power other AI (artificial intelligence) projects at Facebook. "We continue to be very pleased with the performance of M suggestions in Messenger, powered by our learnings from this experiment." M was described as a Siri-like personal assistant that could be used to carry out functions such as booking restaurants and flights and sending gifts. It relied on human help - some suggest as much as 70% of the work. Facebook is expected to continue to offer aspects of the service through M suggestions, a service which offers recommendations to users via Messenger. Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight, said: "Facebook is constantly experimenting in different areas and it appears the M service failed to live up to expectations. On this basis it made sense for the company to shut the service. "However, we believe there are still very extensive investments going into artificial intelligence at Facebook and further AI-powered services will emerge in future."\0.37281534075737,0.025576557964086533,-0.5768149495124817,0.711432158946991,0.2844941318035126,0.2768387198448181,-0.23873336613178253,-0.051521558314561844,-1.513810396194458,0.6961656808853149,-0.27018314599990845,0.11523974686861038,-0.12534503638744354,-0.5481616258621216,-0.8755733370780945,0.06502141058444977,0.26076456904411316,-0.042877886444330215,0.6594318151473999,-0.21824342012405396,0.20707525312900543,0.016877055168151855,0.7484438419342041,-1.0156980752944946,-0.38283249735832214,0.3199162185192108,1.1269930601119995,0.47063207626342773,0.19871893525123596,0.16054314374923706,0.6430268883705139,0.5450983047485352,0.3547908663749695,0.053782928735017776,0.13232794404029846,-0.5346523523330688,0.09361666440963745,-0.024926085025072098,0.6844357252120972,-0.4914833605289459,-0.34717586636543274,-0.26144111156463623,0.10782944411039352,-0.8969722390174866,-0.5403361320495605,-0.9995512962341309,0.18913820385932922,0.1515173763036728,-0.01562945358455181,0.6574134826660156,0.3099002242088318,-0.5204597115516663,0.016684137284755707,-0.730596125125885,0.11417713016271591,0.5211273431777954,0.4768621325492859,0.4900960922241211,-0.21376441419124603,1.044451355934143,-0.27140727639198303,-0.8219455480575562,0.6828539967536926,0.15352585911750793,-0.8602534532546997,0.06109907850623131,1.2599151134490967,1.2659534215927124,-0.47471165657043457,0.6723716259002686,0.32714736461639404,0.3502926528453827,-0.5925813317298889,-0.1880619078874588,-0.09255613386631012,0.49167850613594055,0.36836519837379456,0.45641401410102844,-0.03243953362107277,-0.6227076053619385,-0.16432242095470428,0.7995750308036804,-0.3528730273246765,-0.3990192711353302,0.8626924157142639,0.23692797124385834,0.6674838662147522,0.05811973661184311,0.4429187774658203,-0.6104919910430908,0.2937832474708557,0.17659445106983185,0.14557549357414246,0.146126389503479,0.5861694812774658,0.8170953989028931,0.19725121557712555,-0.24182827770709991,-0.4515689015388489,0.5059683918952942\BBC\Facebook kills virtual assistant M\2018-01-10 18:36:21.0\
1888\Technology\Intel has admitted that patches to fix the Spectre and Meltdown chip flaws could slow machines "in some cases". Its own tests suggested performance slowdown could range from 2% to 14%. It said the impact of the patch, designed to prevent the bug accessing potentially sensitive data, should not be significant for "average computer users". But gaming platforms and others relying on cloud services do appear to have been feeling the effect of the updates. "Based on our most recent PC benchmarking, we continue to expect that the performance impact should not be significant for average computer users," Intel said in a statement. "Eighth Generation Core platforms with solid-state storage will see a performance impact of 6% or less. "This means the typical home and business PC user should not see significant slowdowns in common tasks such as reading email, writing a document or accessing digital photos." Meltdown and Spectre have been discovered in computer chips in billions of computers, smartphone and tablets across the world. If they are not fixed, the vulnerability could be used by hackers to access private information. While Meltdown affects Intel-only processors, Spectre also affects rivals AMD and ARM. Epic Games, publisher of online video game Fortnite, has been one of the first companies to blame the fix for "login issues" and "service instability". "All of our cloud services are affected by updates required to mitigate the Meltdown vulnerability," it said in an online statement. The patch for the vulnerable processors requires intervention on a feature that is directly intended to boost chip performance. "Operating systems and software are now having to do work that the chip previously performed at very high speed," said independent security analyst Graham Cluley. "Because the chips can no longer be trusted to perform one of the critical jobs [for which] they were being relied upon, software is taking the strain and inevitably that means that things will take longer." He added: "The truth is that most of the time most people are not using the full potential of their computer. If they're writing emails or surfing the web they're barely straining their PC's power at all, and so any slowdown is likely to be imperceptible. "Things may change, however, if you're doing something more intensive with your computer - like performing a large number of complex calculations, or processing large amounts of data." Intel is facing a growing number of lawsuits, including claims from groups of consumers alleging that it misled consumers by failing to disclose the security hole and demands for compensation based on the potential slower performance of machines that have been patched.\0.8653402924537659,0.3866594135761261,-0.232436403632164,0.03894314914941788,0.6380390524864197,0.38584932684898376,0.9631279706954956,-0.9974163174629211,-0.6398522257804871,-0.22153928875923157,-0.1887798011302948,1.2299751043319702,-0.3946457505226135,-0.4195171594619751,-0.5092583894729614,1.3148163557052612,-0.7254682779312134,1.340820074081421,-0.07582023739814758,1.0536307096481323,0.8510609269142151,0.3659338355064392,0.572454571723938,-0.8429388403892517,-0.3321124017238617,0.00477563263848424,-0.14412276446819305,-0.5768900513648987,0.5188332200050354,-0.9987413883209229,0.33302077651023865,0.44895508885383606,-0.4193486273288727,-0.5367060899734497,0.7609308362007141,-0.7381067872047424,-0.310581773519516,-0.4184896647930145,0.642676830291748,0.12825007736682892,0.06895828992128372,-0.8861098885536194,-0.13045869767665863,-0.0970204770565033,-0.8886832594871521,-0.2889833450317383,-0.29736173152923584,0.612689733505249,-0.5830585956573486,-0.27359625697135925,-0.2167811244726181,0.022542230784893036,-0.456520140171051,-0.08755984157323837,-0.06690303236246109,-0.9527119994163513,0.18172065913677216,0.4417378604412079,-0.19941505789756775,0.35757699608802795,-0.3437767028808594,0.6799560189247131,-1.1005651950836182,-0.10634101182222366,0.008533567190170288,-0.06333804875612259,0.7277650237083435,0.5036250352859497,-0.742104709148407,0.5168198943138123,0.8029798269271851,-0.00441908510401845,0.37091800570487976,-0.5536114573478699,1.0544441938400269,0.18644168972969055,-0.43625298142433167,1.569557785987854,-0.11708376556634903,-1.261635661125183,-0.1572166085243225,0.3766246438026428,-0.6017431020736694,0.6855177283287048,-0.2510407269001007,0.8232989311218262,0.864658534526825,-0.6763883829116821,-0.49386027455329895,-0.9894723296165466,-1.6089003086090088,0.46077752113342285,-0.021001696586608887,1.575132966041565,0.14486761391162872,0.7663044333457947,0.7841838002204895,-0.9042269587516785,-0.9865401983261108,-0.08461222797632217\BBC\Meltdown fix can make some machines slower - Intel\2018-01-10 14:56:40.0\
1889\Technology\Suspected meddling with satellite navigation systems in Moscow has caused confusion on the roads. Taxi users are facing inflated fares because their position has been wrongly located thousands of miles away. It follows media claims the Kremlin has been trying to confuse global positioning systems (GPS) to thwart possible attacks on top officials. However, the latest wave of reported cases appears to affect a wider area in Moscow. Social media users in Russia have shared screen grabs suggesting their position had been misidentified as 0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude - in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of West Africa. One of them, journalist and technology reviewer Eldar Murtazin, said the error could have been caused by a deliberate disruption of satellite navigation systems "because someone is on the way to somewhere", implying that an official was passing through the area so signals were jammed. Other Twitter users posted screen shots of taxi hailing apps offering fares of several thousand dollars. "Is GPS OK in Moscow?" wondered one of them, posting a screen shot of a bill for 232,924 roubles (£3,000) for a ride from central Moscow to Sheremetyevo airport. Another was offered a fare of 268,820 roubles. Yandex Taxi, one of Moscow's largest online taxi booking services, confirmed to VC.ru website that some of the bills were too high and "were being dealt with manually". Yandex's support service responded to one complaining customer on Twitter by confirming "disruption to GPS signals" and sharing an article that blamed the Kremlin. Belka Car, a car sharing service in Moscow, also warned its customers that GPS signals in Moscow were "unstable" and could misidentify the car's location as being in Romania. Users of satellite navigation systems in Moscow have been complaining since 2016 that they often show clearly false locations. GPS navigators near the Kremlin often misidentify their location as being at a major airport near Moscow. This appears to be done in an attempt to trigger geo-fencing - inbuilt protection systems preventing drones from flying into the path of aircraft. There have also been reports of a mass GPS error affecting at least 20 ships in the Black Sea in 2017, triggering suspicions that Russia may be perfecting GPS misdirection as a weapon. The Russian president's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in 2016 that he had been affected by GPS mislocation near the Kremlin himself, but refused to confirm or deny that security considerations were behind it. "I know nothing about it. You need to ask the Federal Protection Service about this," he told a journalist. "If any security measures are necessary, they have been taken, and this is only the right thing to do," he added.

1890\Technology\Carphone Warehouse has been fined £400,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) after a data breach in 2015. Hackers gained unauthorised access to the personal data of more than three million customers and 1,000 employees during a cyber-attack. The fine is one of the largest ever issued by the ICO. The retailer said it accepts the ICO's findings and apologised for any distress it "may have caused". The data breach affected Carphone Warehouse's online division, which operated the OneStopPhoneShop.com, e2save.com and Mobiles.co.uk websites. The compromised customer data included names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, marital status and, for more than 18,000 customers, historical payment card details. The records for some Carphone Warehouse employees, including names, phone numbers, postcodes, and car registrations were also accessed. The Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said: "A company as large, well-resourced, and established as Carphone Warehouse, should have been actively assessing its data security systems, and ensuring systems were robust and not vulnerable to such attacks. "Carphone Warehouse should be at the top of its game when it comes to cyber-security, and it is concerning that the systemic failures we found related to rudimentary, commonplace measures." The final cost of the fine is expected to be £320,000, as the ICO offers a 20% discount on penalties that are paid less than a month after being issued. The hackers, using valid login credentials, were able to access the computer system using an out-of-date WordPress software. Affected customers and employees were informed at the time. Carphone Warehouse and the ICO have found no evidence of fraud or identity theft from the data breach. A statement from the company said: "As the ICO notes in its report, we moved quickly at the time to secure our systems, to put in place additional security measures and to inform the ICO and potentially affected customers and colleagues. "Since the attack in 2015 we have worked extensively with cyber security experts to improve and upgrade our security systems and processes. "We are very sorry for any distress or inconvenience the incident may have caused."\1.1722074747085571,0.036987945437431335,-0.3553851246833801,-0.14511246979236603,-0.3194650709629059,-0.481606125831604,0.6223770380020142,0.6762940883636475,-1.1691927909851074,1.1519482135772705,-0.0178334042429924,-0.08905834704637527,0.050982654094696045,-0.09415856003761292,-1.1360971927642822,0.4731207489967346,-0.6964083909988403,0.3804740309715271,0.009148919954895973,0.1848399043083191,0.12043330818414688,-0.8481981754302979,1.0476117134094238,-0.04838590696454048,-0.7032665014266968,0.6887285709381104,0.5338400602340698,-0.18949104845523834,0.5097565650939941,-0.390284925699234,0.02866305038332939,0.39748460054397583,0.2813040614128113,-0.2536887228488922,1.0978913307189941,-0.6831146478652954,0.46726977825164795,-0.10653489083051682,-0.03728456050157547,-0.16357721388339996,-0.544550895690918,-0.3966570198535919,0.9047186970710754,0.30267924070358276,-0.6670202612876892,-0.6449434161186218,0.4583415687084198,-0.9205961227416992,-0.10876017808914185,-0.8832092881202698,-0.14624904096126556,-0.30495259165763855,0.7901071310043335,-0.052686356008052826,0.4104842245578766,0.027777137234807014,-0.40754756331443787,-0.24398379027843475,-0.48648884892463684,1.6670409440994263,-0.4372445046901703,-0.6500307321548462,0.05546880140900612,-0.4823110103607178,-0.024801218882203102,-0.64509516954422,-0.3286360800266266,1.125739574432373,-0.7238926291465759,0.018427608534693718,-0.4351881742477417,0.4454928934574127,0.4091484546661377,0.48828229308128357,-0.7606539726257324,-0.8384291529655457,-0.4531145393848419,0.4691542983055115,-0.12921512126922607,-0.4763742685317993,0.5140047073364258,-0.23597492277622223,0.283830851316452,0.13173553347587585,-0.05402720347046852,0.6975668668746948,-0.04605088382959366,-0.1853591799736023,-0.25215819478034973,-0.17296549677848816,-0.783844530582428,0.3951427638530731,-0.32681921124458313,0.3619231581687927,-0.0239671990275383,0.11428171396255493,0.5132853984832764,-1.116830825805664,-0.27622145414352417,0.299180269241333\BBC\Carphone Warehouse fined £400,000 over data breach\2018-01-10 15:31:58.0\
1891\Technology\Apple's iCloud services in mainland China will be operated by a Chinese company from next month, the tech giant has confirmed. It has contacted customers based in China, advising them to examine new terms and conditions. They include a clause that both Apple and the Chinese firm will have access to all data stored on iCloud. Apple said it had made the move to comply with the country's cloud computing regulations. iCloud accounts registered outside of China are not affected. The Chinese cyber security rules, introduced in July last year, include a requirement for companies to store all data within China. The firm, Guizhou on the Cloud Big Data (GCBD), is owned by the Guizhou provincial government in southern China. Guizhou is where Apple opened a $1bn (£738m) data centre last year to meet the regulations. iCloud data will be transferred from 28 February, Apple said. Customers living in mainland China who did not want to use iCloud operated by GCBD were given the option to terminate their account. Apple said the "partnership" with GCBD would allow it to "improve the speed and reliability of our iCloud services products while also complying with newly passed regulations that cloud services be operated by Chinese companies". It added that Apple had "strong data privacy and security protections in place and no backdoors will be created into any of our systems". However, some on social media have said the step gives Beijing more opportunity to monitor its citizens and others living in the country. Analysis: Kerry Allen, China media analyst, BBC Monitoring Having domestic control over mainland Chinese iCloud accounts will delight the Beijing authorities, who have been pushing to oversee Apple's software presence in the country for months. Government media have been exerting increased pressure on Apple to operate in line with China's strict media regulations, or else be forced out of the market. In August 2017, Apple were heavily criticised by Beijing for threatening to remove applications by leading Chinese tech company Tencent, including the WhatsApp-like mobile messenger WeChat. Apple sought to secure a 30% commission on app updates through the Apple Store, rather than allow domestic software developers to have the freedom to update them in the background. Influential media subsequently launched an attack on the company and called for a boycott of Apple products. Articles stressed the growing supremacy of Chinese technologies, and news websites published articles telling users they might be forced to choose between Apple or Tencent. Social media users threw their support behind Tencent, saying they could not give up WeChat, which has more than a billion registered users. Users typically use iCloud to store data such as documents and photographs. The move comes after the company was criticised by some last year for removing Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) from its App Store in mainland China - software that allowed users to get round government restrictions on internet access. Apple chief executive Tim Cook defended the action at the time, saying he would "rather not" be doing it, adding he hoped the restrictions would be "lessened" over time. He added the firm had to comply with Chinese regulations requiring licenses for VPN sellers.\0.059808094054460526,-0.03352033719420433,-0.03623313456773758,-0.26667556166648865,-0.22130422294139862,0.2133232206106186,1.218308925628662,-1.5079936981201172,-0.5621693730354309,-0.47981855273246765,0.4111386835575104,-0.35297486186027527,0.31269896030426025,-0.4172461926937103,0.32237038016319275,0.5636689066886902,-0.5739067196846008,-0.07189516723155975,0.7570986151695251,0.41342657804489136,0.6450487971305847,-0.7497682571411133,0.7246530055999756,-0.6031177639961243,0.4294087588787079,-0.06544826924800873,-0.44212642312049866,0.1238250806927681,-0.09175857901573181,-0.06128256022930145,-0.33055198192596436,0.1584191471338272,0.3945281207561493,-0.4703786075115204,-0.49566125869750977,-0.4455431401729584,1.2093979120254517,-0.18023687601089478,-0.07333090156316757,-0.25066396594047546,-1.2018985748291016,-0.009590920060873032,0.6920405626296997,-0.9499108791351318,-0.33474409580230713,-1.8158855438232422,1.0409367084503174,0.5951874256134033,-1.353004813194275,-0.3376808166503906,-1.2791473865509033,0.12721996009349823,0.5482088327407837,-0.34086549282073975,-0.019326364621520042,-0.9561066627502441,0.7017627954483032,-1.4565272331237793,-0.5071597099304199,1.2650643587112427,-0.41202041506767273,-0.5612637400627136,-0.21594779193401337,0.25503644347190857,-1.02854585647583,-1.0491899251937866,0.3436412215232849,0.4850735664367676,-0.42215052247047424,0.1532049924135208,-0.7113491296768188,0.11114373803138733,0.39409127831459045,-0.19006791710853577,-0.5124328136444092,-0.5102232694625854,-0.47065091133117676,-0.09490805119276047,-0.7577036023139954,-0.46535760164260864,0.5660274028778076,0.24620971083641052,0.004307137336581945,1.6252083778381348,0.6647406220436096,1.0647364854812622,-0.11937421560287476,-0.3083912432193756,0.5545297265052795,0.6497059464454651,-0.26154521107673645,0.1590757519006729,0.16934052109718323,0.8824427127838135,-0.9181177020072937,0.16797330975532532,1.7192462682724,-1.3813910484313965,-1.9111554622650146,0.8297985792160034\BBC\Apple: Chinese firm to operate China iCloud accounts\2018-01-10 13:36:48.0\
1892\Technology\Microsoft has halted some patches for the Meltdown and Spectre chip bugs after AMD customers complained that the software updates froze their machines. The flaw in computer chips affects billions of PCs, smartphones and tablets around the world. Specific fixes for the bugs on Windows 10, Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 had caused some machines to suffer blue-screen errors, Microsoft said. In a blogpost, it said it was working with AMD to resolve the issue. Microsoft said that it would resume fixes "as soon as possible". "To prevent AMD customers from getting into an unbootable state, Microsoft will temporarily pause sending the following Windows operating system updates to devices with impacted AMD processors at this time," Microsoft said in the post. It added that some AMD chipsets "do not conform with the documentation previously provided to Microsoft". AMD had previously said that the Meltdown bug did not affect it and that issues with Spectre could be resolved with software updates. "AMD is aware of an issue with some older generation processors following installation of a Microsoft security update that was published over the weekend," it said in a fresh statement "AMD and Microsoft have been working on an update to resolve the issue and expect it to begin rolling out again for those impacted shortly." The discovery of two major flaws in computer chips have forced Apple, Microsoft and Google to rush out fixes for devices and operating systems. Meltdown is currently thought to primarily affect most Intel processors manufactured since 1995, while Spectre affects chips made by a variety of manufacturers including Intel, AMD and ARM. In a keynote address at the CES technology conference in Las Vegas, Intel's chief executive Brian Krzaich said 90% of its processors and products from the last five years would be patched "within a week". Most experts agree that patching Spectre is going to be harder and take longer.\0.8651240468025208,0.4366794228553772,-0.2935730218887329,-0.45399460196495056,-0.49804791808128357,0.405862033367157,1.0470771789550781,-0.38525116443634033,-0.47564709186553955,0.09355947375297546,-0.399370014667511,1.0130640268325806,0.9206446409225464,0.6342934370040894,-0.6427107453346252,0.06078048422932625,-0.8315237760543823,-0.07325594127178192,0.8695862293243408,0.291664719581604,-0.7334048748016357,-0.10521981120109558,0.2897769510746002,-0.6587681770324707,0.4714757204055786,-0.19505682587623596,-0.3550340235233307,-0.18304947018623352,0.287908673286438,0.13604794442653656,0.18378092348575592,0.3498593270778656,0.26509594917297363,-0.18245622515678406,0.10997733473777771,-1.226613163948059,-0.3396046459674835,-0.19792556762695312,0.3124776780605316,-0.2168513983488083,0.2996216416358948,-0.624170184135437,0.2447172999382019,0.18069322407245636,-0.272763192653656,0.07586683332920074,-0.0350637212395668,0.02973247691988945,-1.4273604154586792,0.2613068222999573,0.4637264907360077,-0.172236368060112,-0.033686522394418716,-0.14140446484088898,0.3738921582698822,-0.5594686269760132,-0.17932556569576263,-0.5195083022117615,-0.11785135418176651,0.8216579556465149,-0.4108741879463196,0.314410537481308,-0.5266842246055603,-0.14409960806369781,-0.31195324659347534,-0.18818463385105133,0.3561561107635498,1.1387996673583984,-0.7965056896209717,0.09631041437387466,-0.1425311118364334,-0.3972291052341461,0.07983018457889557,0.14211095869541168,0.1347499042749405,-0.37880441546440125,0.22172094881534576,0.9624437689781189,-1.2036937475204468,-0.630537748336792,1.0078554153442383,-0.16606900095939636,-0.6826536059379578,0.8105018138885498,0.18320433795452118,0.27121198177337646,0.49724575877189636,0.07317937910556793,-0.09858542680740356,-0.09839048236608505,-0.5185475945472717,0.35355424880981445,-0.050502002239227295,0.8186450600624084,-0.48794806003570557,0.4157015383243561,-0.23241177201271057,-0.7617329359054565,-0.7777922749519348,0.9999640583992004\BBC\Freezing machines halt chip bug patch\2018-01-09 16:48:37.0\
1893\Technology\A last-minute deal has been struck between the makers of video game Overwatch and streaming site Twitch a day before matches kick off in a newly created league. Developer Activision Blizzard hopes that the matches Twitch will stream will help make e-sports mainstream. Overwatch is hugely popular, with 35 million players worldwide. The fact the deal was struck so late could affect viewing numbers, said one analyst. The first-person shooter features about two dozen characters in team-based battles set across a near-future Earth. In July, Activision Blizzard announced an e-sports league for the game that it hopes could eventually prove more lucrative than the UK's football Premier League. The e-sports competition will feature teams from different cities around the world. The two-year deal with Twitch gives the platform exclusive worldwide rights to all the matches, which will be streamed in English, Korean and French. "Blizzard has cut it fine by announcing Twitch as its streaming partner for the Overwatch League just a day before the start of the competition in Los Angeles on 10 January," said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at analyst IHS Markit. "There is no doubt that the delay in confirming the distribution deal will have impacted the negotiations by teams for sponsorships and will give Twitch very little time to build awareness before the first match, which suggests the opening matches may have relatively low viewer numbers." Activision Blizzard said the deal was great "for our growing global fan base". "Our fans love to engage with content on Twitch, and we wanted to drive significant viewership of the Overwatch League in its inaugural season and beyond," said Armin Zerza, chief operating officer of Blizzard Entertainment. Kevin Lin, chief operating officer of Twitch, said: "The Overwatch League is making a major impact on e-sports by reshaping the industry with city-based teams. "Given Overwatch's consistent reign as a top-viewed game by our community, we look forward to offering their pioneering style of league play to a large and passionate fan base that will be able to bond over not only their favourite plays, but hometown pride." The deal was a huge boost for Twitch, said Mr Harding-Rolls. "This cements Twitch's position as the strongest Western player in live e-sports video, and I consider the platform a natural home for the Overwatch League," he said. "The deal will help Twitch penetrate into markets such as Korea, where local e-sports streaming platforms and broadcasters are traditionally dominant." Missing from the deal is China, home to the biggest e-sports viewing audience, and Mr Harding-Rolls predicted there would be a separate announcement about media partnerships in this country. The Overwatch League will run, at the Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles, until June, with play-offs and finals scheduled for July.\0.6782460808753967,0.18440404534339905,0.033687613904476166,0.019672663882374763,-0.5096511840820312,-0.21426032483577728,1.4413429498672485,-0.8643175959587097,-0.6305391192436218,-0.4202677011489868,-0.7605119347572327,0.4105725884437561,0.16559898853302002,1.3601528406143188,-0.7710300087928772,0.42206504940986633,-0.8530006408691406,-0.12376944720745087,0.4785813093185425,0.1452062875032425,-0.3409941792488098,0.020064299926161766,-0.23647047579288483,-0.23468835651874542,0.3155031204223633,-0.05158640816807747,0.12226921319961548,1.102771282196045,0.9053683280944824,0.3784724175930023,-0.5617825388908386,0.4241448938846588,0.3061482608318329,-0.5068145990371704,-0.4400955140590668,-0.6974669694900513,-0.6296228170394897,-0.09619377553462982,0.4988859295845032,-0.3159800171852112,-0.6857196688652039,-0.09874133765697479,0.5716640949249268,-0.4430220127105713,-0.41197189688682556,0.2291860729455948,0.2422277182340622,0.9937832951545715,-1.0535836219787598,-0.28474849462509155,0.7716928720474243,0.7775536179542542,0.5260302424430847,-0.876468300819397,0.9789279699325562,-1.0207462310791016,0.5697449445724487,0.5329714417457581,-0.4824256896972656,0.7224186062812805,0.1846466213464737,-0.3831735849380493,-0.010793068446218967,0.4094310998916626,-0.9761198163032532,-0.06418173015117645,0.6543161869049072,0.6553560495376587,-0.24291540682315826,0.7087801694869995,0.6483154296875,-0.19830140471458435,0.03182506561279297,0.30265796184539795,-0.31754109263420105,0.3008052110671997,-0.26885393261909485,0.08118192106485367,-1.0306073427200317,-0.06311054527759552,0.2847234010696411,-0.4680452346801758,0.886442244052887,1.0307831764221191,0.3478977680206299,-0.03628746047616005,0.9427847862243652,-0.133718341588974,0.3360847532749176,-0.1831568032503128,-0.11738690733909607,0.9548773765563965,0.027071015909314156,0.593386173248291,0.369588166475296,-0.039128970354795456,-1.0302611589431763,-0.021491682156920433,-1.350341558456421,0.2209160476922989\BBC\Twitch in last-minute deal with Overwatch\2018-01-09 18:15:27.0\
1894\Technology\Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei says it has not been able to strike a deal to sell its new smartphone via a US carrier. It was widely reported to have been in talks to release its flagship Mate 10 Pro device with AT&T. But in a letter seen by Reuters, politicians scuppered the deal citing security concerns. The snub would be the latest example of a Chinese firm struggling to do business in the US. Last week the US blocked the $1.2bn (£880m) sale of money transfer firm Moneygram to China's Ant Financial, the digital payments arm of Alibaba. It was the highest profile Chinese deal to be rejected by Washington since Donald Trump came to power. Huawei's chief executive officer Richard Yu told an audience at the CES tech fair in Las Vegas that plans to tie up with a US carrier "unfortunately" had not come to fruition. He did not comment on why a deal was not forthcoming, but said it was "a big loss for consumers, because they don't have the best choice for devices," Techcrunch reported. The Mate 10 Pro - Huawei's main competition against Apple's iPhone and Samsung's high-end handsets - will still be on sale in the US via sites such as Amazon. But deals with carriers are important in the US because the majority of smartphones are purchased through carriers. "The US market presents unique challenges for Huawei, and while the Huawei Mate 10 Pro will not be sold by US carriers, we remain committed to this market now and in the future," Huawei said. According to Reuters, AT&T was pressured to pull out of the deal after 18 members of the US Senate and House intelligence committees signed a letter to regulators expressing concerns about Chinese companies getting involved in US telecoms. The letter notes worries over "Chinese espionage in general, and Huawei's role in that espionage in particular". In 2012, a US congressional panel said Chinese telecom firms Huawei and ZTE should be barred from any mergers and acquisitions because the two firms posed a security threat to the US. Huawei is the world's number three smartphone brand behind Apple and Samsung.\0.05088355764746666,1.0094608068466187,0.114019013941288,0.3394412696361542,0.5594981908798218,-0.14780667424201965,0.774318277835846,-0.6543003916740417,0.20954737067222595,-0.5825299620628357,-0.11679275333881378,-0.22298088669776917,-0.07691242545843124,-0.5271677374839783,0.1968640387058258,-0.3823885917663574,-0.07458478212356567,-1.0886622667312622,0.3160448372364044,0.6463085412979126,0.5899563431739807,-0.7567339539527893,-0.2623669505119324,0.1472911685705185,0.341238796710968,0.6937820315361023,-0.2036781758069992,-0.11112737655639648,-0.22703251242637634,0.6243745684623718,-0.32208287715911865,0.0651785358786583,-0.05165193974971771,0.277982234954834,-0.09515306353569031,-0.5168087482452393,0.20258881151676178,0.4175804555416107,0.10309713333845139,0.16013726592063904,-0.5565902590751648,-0.16523857414722443,0.5730140209197998,-0.8545771241188049,0.5567022562026978,-0.8499859571456909,-0.18985724449157715,-0.3062410354614258,-0.02773880399763584,0.2358502894639969,0.806705117225647,0.548775851726532,0.2738361358642578,0.31350550055503845,0.32205700874328613,-0.04605745151638985,1.0505733489990234,0.5145465135574341,-0.8107625842094421,-0.6403594017028809,0.31802475452423096,-0.5081800222396851,-0.2949986457824707,-0.2135668694972992,-0.7129272222518921,0.4786740839481354,1.006118655204773,0.21702246367931366,-0.23196052014827728,2.1428637504577637,0.12889866530895233,-0.07343048602342606,-0.4603717625141144,0.20775452256202698,0.2838948965072632,-0.3082331717014313,-0.44943225383758545,-0.14206579327583313,-0.9545867443084717,-0.8961395621299744,0.07753156125545502,0.8919617533683777,0.24669507145881653,1.4274771213531494,0.0032566480804234743,0.17912092804908752,0.4515439569950104,0.0715380609035492,-0.44528928399086,-0.12164460867643356,-0.06450547277927399,-0.15511000156402588,-0.6847522854804993,0.7423792481422424,0.04479680955410004,-0.007928171195089817,-0.384002685546875,-0.6974132061004639,-1.9590955972671509,0.052755650132894516\BBC\Huawei's US smartphone deal collapses\2018-01-10 07:36:15.0\
1895\Technology\Electronic toymaker VTech will pay $650,000 (£480,000) to settle charges that it failed to protect the privacy of children using its gadgets. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) levelled the charges at VTech following a data breach in 2015. While investigating the breach, the FTC found the firm had broken US laws governing the way data about children is gathered. The FTC said VTech also "failed to take reasonable steps" to secure that data. VTech gathered a lot of data about children via its Kid Connect app that was bundled in with many of the electronic toys it makes. Almost 650,000 children downloaded the app and used it in conjunction with VTech's educational toys. The app collected personal information but did so without seeking consent from parents or telling children what data was being collected and the uses to which it would be put, said the FTC. VTech's poor data security practices meant a security researcher could get at the firm's network and take personal information which included customers' names as well as email addresses, it added in its complaint. The hacker was also able to get at an internal database that held copies of encryption keys that, if used, would have let an attacker view photos and audio files uploaded by children and parents. VTech was unaware that its network had been penetrated and data taken until it was contacted by a journalist. "As connected toys become increasingly popular, it's more important than ever that companies let parents know how their kids' data is collected and used and that they take reasonable steps to secure that data," said Maureen Ohlhausen, acting FTC chairwoman, in a statement. "Unfortunately," she added, "VTech fell short in both of these areas." As well as paying the financial penalty, VTech has pledged to uphold US child data protection laws in future. It has also agreed to improve its security practices and will be subjected to regular independent data and privacy audits for the next 20 years. In a statement, VTech said parents were left in no doubt about the type of information being collected about children and were able to decide who they talked to via the app. It said it collected data only to help users of its products to communicate with each other, not for marketing purposes. Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center which campaigns on privacy issues, welcomed the FTC's action but said the penalty could have been levied more swiftly. "This is good news that the FTC finally took action but we feel like they are moving too slow and clearly following and not leading," Mr. Rotenberg told the New York Times.\0.2064930647611618,-0.24640029668807983,0.13972726464271545,-1.6141257286071777,-0.5607477426528931,0.7918536067008972,0.23361626267433167,-0.5867795944213867,-0.7660383582115173,-0.004175522830337286,-0.31331866979599,0.9235568642616272,-0.4398750066757202,-0.810347855091095,-0.6202865839004517,-0.5196080207824707,-1.1133042573928833,0.22762735188007355,0.5386735200881958,1.0285251140594482,0.27686694264411926,-0.7921972274780273,0.0860353633761406,-0.6458781361579895,0.1378333866596222,-0.32290732860565186,-0.019457129761576653,0.14678101241588593,0.7854401469230652,-1.2431416511535645,-0.040602877736091614,1.1087700128555298,-0.8900370597839355,0.25810644030570984,0.15087756514549255,-1.1752182245254517,0.8755752444267273,-0.59412682056427,-0.3019530773162842,-0.9726019501686096,-0.819158136844635,-0.8442686200141907,0.2527685761451721,-0.4086493253707886,-0.8106823563575745,-1.7714097499847412,0.4295502007007599,-0.40727511048316956,-0.5501814484596252,0.09691478312015533,0.05262606963515282,-0.9272421002388,0.19652101397514343,-0.43166038393974304,0.8768442869186401,-0.5144385695457458,0.333789199590683,0.18016137182712555,-0.4869460463523865,0.9395796060562134,-0.6289101243019104,-0.10374313592910767,0.5287867188453674,-0.4654989242553711,-0.33499619364738464,-0.3985365033149719,1.198264718055725,1.8995552062988281,-0.3391861021518707,0.40277230739593506,-0.08742710947990417,-0.15058696269989014,0.5686250925064087,-0.3012670874595642,0.6637775897979736,-0.990998387336731,-1.1936472654342651,0.42447206377983093,-0.8345176577568054,-1.3206067085266113,0.8988077044487,-0.20922717452049255,-0.506450891494751,-0.31381955742836,-0.03063111938536167,0.9927681684494019,0.1754712164402008,-0.19675222039222717,0.04614057019352913,-1.271746277809143,-0.150513157248497,0.037940613925457,-1.0943690538406372,0.6297706365585327,-0.4666614830493927,0.7474721074104309,0.02980939857661724,-0.814728319644928,-1.1222624778747559,0.2877572476863861\BBC\Toy firm VTech fined $650,000 over data breach\2018-01-09 12:29:00.0\
1896\Technology\A Hindu woman has killed herself after facing harassment over her friendship with a Muslim man in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, police say. She told a friend on WhatsApp that she loved Muslims after being questioned over her friendship with the man. Police said screenshots of this exchange were shared on social media. Five people from Hindu hardline groups also visited her house on Saturday to warn her parents, police say. The 20-year-old killed herself the same day. The police initially registered a case of suicide, but widened their investigation after reports about the role of social media in her death started to emerge on Monday. K Annamalai, a senior police officer Chikkamagaluru district, told the BBC that the woman had left a suicide note. "She has mentioned that there was a photo of her with a man from another religious community. People started commenting about it and cast aspersions on her character," he said. He added that he killed herself after five persons went to her house and "complained to her mother that she was in love with a Muslim man." He added that the police had arrested one person, and were searching for others. BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi, who has seen the screenshots, said her WhatsApp messages were quickly shared in the district. In the messages, she is advised not to get "involved" with a man from another faith. She replies: "But I love Muslims." She adds that she doesn't find anything wrong in being "associated" with members of any religious community. Mr Annamalai said "whoever has criticised the woman, whether on Facebook or WhatsApp, would be arrested". "We believe it amounts to harassment due to which a young life has been lost. We are taking this case seriously because it wasn't her fault," he added. In recent years, India has witnessed Hindu-Muslim tensions over what has come to be known as "love jihad". The term has been popularised by radical Hindu fringe groups, who accuse Muslim men of participating in a "conspiracy to turn Hindu women from their religion by seducing them".

1897\Technology\Just Eat offered a £10 voucher to a woman who complained a delivery driver sent her unwanted messages. Michelle Midwinter posted screenshots of the conversation on Twitter in which the man appears to call her "baby" and sends her a pair of lips as an emoji. She also posted Just Eat's reply to her complaint in which they offered her a £10 goodwill voucher. Just Eat says its initial response was "appalling" and it's investigating the initial complaint. The messages appear to show the delivery driver started a conversation with Michelle over Whatsapp after delivering her takeaway. He asked whether Michelle, who lives in Gloucestershire, had a boyfriend - saying he didn't want to "make problems". The messages were signed off with "good night bby see you next time when I get your meal". Michelle, who is a make-up artist, told Newsbeat: "At first I was shocked at the fact someone could approach me in that way, but that turned to feeling very uncomfortable as I realised this guy had my name, address, and phone number." She complained to Just Eat and shared their conversation as part of the tweet. In the messages, Just Eat appear to say "we don't have a complaint department" and to give a "constructive" feedback on the restaurant. The company offered her a £5 goodwill voucher which it later upped to £10. It described the incident as "an inconvenience" but Michelle said it was "not an inconvenience, it's absolutely outrageous and disgusting behaviour". Michelle later said on Twitter she had been "astounded" by the number of women who had contacted her saying they'd had similar experiences with various companies. She told Newsbeat in a statement: "The scary thing is the sheer number of females who have had similar experiences - a few with Just Eat, but generally this issue is much bigger and more widespread than I initially anticipated. "We trust companies with our personal details and for them to be used in this way is unacceptable." Newsbeat has been in touch with Just Eat for a response and it said it was "deeply concerned" to hear about the incident. It said the driver acted in a way that did not represent the company and it was investigating with the restaurant involved. "We are also speaking to this customer offline and if the customer decides this is a criminal matter and reports it to the police, we will of course assist the police with any investigation." It also said it was "appalled" at the way the initial complaint was handled. "This lacked empathy and does not reflect our policies or the way Just Eat would expect something like this to be dealt with." It said it has a procedure for dealing with customer complaints and will step in if an issue "is not resolved satisfactorily on first contact". It said the incident had been highlighted to ensure "this doesn't happen again".

1898\Technology\A group of developers are attempting to revive the Zano drone - one of Kickstarter's most notorious failures. The handheld quadcopter raised £2.3m from more than 12,000 backers on the crowdfunding platform before the project imploded in 2015. The resulting scandal prompted a probe that found fault with all involved. The Zano Camera project is one of several initiatives on show at the CES expo that make use of seized assets from failed crowdfunding campaigns. The person leading the effort is Vernon Kerswell, chief executive of Extreme Fliers, a London-based micro drone manufacturer. His company paid just over £100,000 to buy the assets of Zano's original developer - the Swansea, Wales-headquartered Torquing Group - after it collapsed. "Zano was deeply flawed and there was a lot of issues with the software and the hardware, and that's ultimately why they never shipped [en masse]," he told the BBC at the Las Vegas trade show. "But a lot of the technology was very interesting and way ahead of what else was out there at the time. "Drone companies out there would never risk putting unproven technologies in their flagship products. "But we can use it as a platform to test new ideas and build a group of passionate developers." The project involves open-sourcing the intellectual property involved in the Zano drones, so that enthusiasts across the globe can work together to tackle the fact the limited number of units that made it into backers' hands are now effectively "undead". "There are about 1,000 units out there that shipped but they were bricked when the company went bankrupt because the computer server that they were dependent on was switched off," explained Mr Kerswell. More from CES 2018: If he receives enough support for the not-for-profit venture, he believes an app could be released as soon as April that could upload new firmware to the drones via wi-fi. This would allow them to be controlled by their users without the support of an external server. If there is demand, Mr Kerswell also suggested further units could be manufactured. But he said that changes to the hardware's design would be necessary first. The arms of existing Zano drones, he explained, were too fragile meaning the rotor blades snapped off if they suffered a minor collision. A downwards-facing camera should also be added, he said, to make it possible for the drones to fly on the spot. In addition, he said different antennas and infrared sensors would be required to deliver the kind of range and obstacle-avoidance consumers now expected. For now, the entrepreneur is able to demonstrate one of the original units flying again at CES's Eureka Park start-up zone, and he has launched a website where he promises to let the public track progress. Another drone on show at CES has already been put on sale after returning from the dead. US-based Lily Robotics raised more than $34m (£25.1m) via its own website after publishing a YouTube video that showed its throw-and-go quadcopter - the Lily Camera - navigating its own flight path and surviving a dunk in water. However, the company was wound down a year ago after it said it had failed to secure further funds from investors. Its assets were subsequently acquired by another Californian firm, Mota, which released the Lily Next Generation drone late last year, albeit without the waterproofing originally promised. "We think the worldwide brand awareness far outweighs any risk," a spokesman said about retaining Lily's name. "We launched... in October 2017, and it's been selling very well since." Skully Technologies is also at the trade fair with a hi-tech "intelligent" motorcycle helmet based on the work of a failed $2.4m Indiegogo campaign. The Skully Fenix AR promises users a heads-up display, a blindspot camera and hands-free phone calls among other features. The Atlanta, Georgia-based company used the show to announce that the product should be ready to go on sale in the summer. It has pledged to give some units away to the project's original backers even though it says it has not formal obligation to do so.\0.24376705288887024,-0.37089353799819946,-0.5490003228187561,-0.2666998505592346,-0.5843421816825867,0.3754688501358032,-0.8554378747940063,0.020470047369599342,-2.0374984741210938,0.12925007939338684,-0.6712647676467896,1.1249648332595825,-0.7099180817604065,0.5928438305854797,0.05715242400765419,-0.791959285736084,-0.598829984664917,1.1510462760925293,0.6764511466026306,-0.4323650598526001,0.3245469927787781,0.03207650035619736,-0.49289175868034363,-0.011463318020105362,-0.16674506664276123,-0.23126478493213654,0.7526881098747253,1.0836701393127441,0.8109540939331055,0.19365470111370087,-0.37385082244873047,0.6865188479423523,0.3013004958629608,-0.3457821011543274,0.07147321850061417,-0.8689671754837036,-0.14703845977783203,-0.09567109495401382,0.5860818028450012,-0.8250203132629395,-1.2095314264297485,-0.9524632692337036,1.1721270084381104,0.31685110926628113,-0.4018615782260895,-0.015101112425327301,0.29150137305259705,-0.49665018916130066,-0.7336059212684631,-0.3834129869937897,0.842250645160675,0.06805381178855896,-1.1650807857513428,0.007643082179129124,1.847822666168213,-0.34548401832580566,-0.848459780216217,-0.5123107433319092,-0.3582838177680969,0.5154393911361694,0.8387307524681091,0.2996329963207245,0.6344681978225708,-0.2903527319431305,-0.11834486573934555,-0.734316885471344,-0.2984806299209595,1.8908876180648804,-0.1785265952348709,-0.33238908648490906,0.5861550569534302,0.5606590509414673,-0.5231913924217224,-0.07073965668678284,-0.1265549510717392,1.0770847797393799,-0.503834068775177,-0.01197631936520338,-1.3919514417648315,-1.4465845823287964,0.44494760036468506,-0.464169442653656,-0.1358000636100769,1.287161111831665,0.6797769665718079,0.9953740835189819,1.4172558784484863,0.6249397397041321,0.20390097796916962,-0.18283425271511078,-0.13656552135944366,0.28174152970314026,-0.023506438359618187,-0.7171949744224548,-0.8887166976928711,-0.8230645656585693,0.091096892952919,0.615660548210144,-0.7274734377861023,0.0844532698392868\BBC\CES 2018: Zano the zombie drone whirs back to life\2018-01-10 04:09:57.0\
1899\Technology\Car companies displayed the latest trucks and electric vehicles at the North American Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan this week. Here are some of the highlights - from futuristic concept cars to vehicles aimed at road-users today. The next crop of SUVs and trucks will come to market with prominent grills and ever narrower headlights, a look auto buffs said is designed to project power. The leaner, meaner headlights are also one of the most visible ways that new technology - in this case, LED lighting - is changing car design. The new lights are more powerful, allowing companies to shrink their size, while declining costs have freed companies to incorporate more varied designs. Tail lights carve out C-shapes on the Chevy Silverado truck. The Mercedes Benz fleet uses lighting details as signatures for each vehicle class. And BMW unveiled a new mini with a Union Jack on its tail-light. "This is design. It's cool, customers will love it and it will help motivate customers to buy the car," says Nicolas Peter, a member of BMW's managing board. As reliability and features get more uniform, car companies are turning more to design and customization to distinguish their products and keep buyers interested, says Brian Moody, executive editor of Autotrader, an online car sales site. "That's the next frontier." Guangzhou Automobile Group or GAC, one of the leading Chinese car companies, had floor space at the show for a fourth year. The company says it has its eye on the US market, where it plans to start selling toward the end of 2019. The firm had earlier set a 2017 target date. At this year's show, the company's unveiled a sci-fi inspired concept car, a two-seater with doors that opened like wings, virtual reality screens on the side windows and a fog lamp that could be detached for use as a flashlight. Breaking into the car market is an uphill battle for any new company, but analysts say futuristic concept cars are one way to catch the public's attention, even if they never become reality. "Chinese automakers want to get our attention just like the next company," says Mr Moody of Autotrader. "The whole point of concept cars is that wow factor to get you in." Several companies have announced US expansions recently, news that has drawn extra attention amid the America First rhetoric of President Donald Trump and jockeying over trade agreements. BMW continued this trend, pledging to invest an additional $600m into its Spartanburg, South Carolina plant by 2021, and spend $200m on training and education. "We are proud to call the United States our second home and to be responsible for more than 70,000 jobs in this great country," says Nicolas Peter, one of BMW's managing board members. Companies have long had plants in the US for efficiency reasons. But emphasizing those commitments may be more "top of mind" this year due to the political currents, said Mr Moody. Mike Helton, vice chairman of Nascar, said companies are also tapping into the sentiments of their customers, who want their purchases to support their communities. He said that focus is especially true of younger buyers, who have a reputation for aligning buying decisions with their values. "There's a consciousness," he says, customers "want to feel good about owning the product". This year's show is heavy on nostalgia, especially from the established US and European carmakers. Chevy is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its Silverado truck. In the US, Ford has revived the Ranger, which was already available in foreign markets. The company also drew on the 1968 movie Bullitt for its latest Mustang sports car. Mercedes-Benz also re-engineered its deluxe G-class SUV, introducing new suspension, steering and safety systems, while preserving the boxy look of the original 1979 off-road vehicle. The pricey wagon only represents about 1% of Mercedes' US business, but it says the classic design resonates with the public. "The attention that we get with it is just unbelievable," says Dietmar Exler, president and chief executive of MB USA.\0.20982609689235687,-0.684673547744751,-0.7689526677131653,-0.28043296933174133,0.7161573171615601,-0.006557053420692682,2.0491368770599365,-0.654007077217102,-0.9223910570144653,-0.19073227047920227,0.2031700164079666,0.40821439027786255,-0.14894966781139374,-0.686173677444458,0.2871660888195038,-0.8620904088020325,-0.7330312728881836,0.9583425521850586,-0.07019152492284775,0.1141003668308258,-0.09942653030157089,-1.4441965818405151,0.40296024084091187,-0.588073194026947,-0.7158206701278687,0.6326799988746643,0.29784539341926575,-0.9116664528846741,0.6671951413154602,-0.2125299572944641,0.2617882788181305,0.9274847507476807,0.02723126858472824,-0.37030887603759766,-0.711991548538208,0.028022559359669685,-0.10320117324590683,0.3536699414253235,-0.0960884764790535,0.33757349848747253,-0.7392905354499817,-0.5528335571289062,0.47214043140411377,0.03134414553642273,-0.26744163036346436,-0.3350669741630554,0.30289748311042786,1.060324788093567,-1.931983232498169,0.08385604619979858,0.05128195881843567,0.05881417542695999,-1.2578859329223633,0.2654930353164673,1.0300284624099731,-0.23559421300888062,-0.5522005558013916,0.5532186627388,-0.7051186561584473,-0.4215695858001709,0.3759806454181671,-0.5631592869758606,-0.3946912884712219,-0.2750304937362671,-0.5449994206428528,1.3427205085754395,0.3786475956439972,0.67034512758255,-0.8850273489952087,-0.0180934127420187,1.0131971836090088,0.7174742817878723,-0.9055058360099792,1.3329603672027588,0.9075887203216553,0.9518535137176514,-0.4947529435157776,0.8189728260040283,-2.0437183380126953,-2.619565486907959,0.2968562841415405,-0.3322250545024872,-1.2395625114440918,2.420926332473755,0.5735642910003662,0.2811782658100128,0.4669436812400818,1.2343668937683105,0.32961130142211914,0.11374577134847641,-0.7080363035202026,1.8056936264038086,-0.5283923149108887,1.4368083477020264,-0.20912423729896545,0.49681389331817627,0.571376621723175,0.22348806262016296,-0.5046356320381165,0.7714225053787231\BBC\Heads up\2018-01-16 12:36:15.0\
1900\Technology\With cyber-attacks increasing in frequency and severity, many companies are turning to insurance to cover their mounting losses. But can insurers quantify the risk accurately and could insurance lead to corporate complacency? Many firms feel like they're under siege. Cyber-attacks are coming thick and fast and the tools at the hackers' disposal seem to be getting more, not less, powerful. Estimated annual losses from cyber crime now top $400bn (£291bn), according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. And the cost in lost productivity of last year's WannaCry ransomware attack alone was estimated at $4bn. So many businesses are buying cyber insurance "in a mad panic", warns Charl van der Walt of SecureData, a cyber-security company. "Unfortunately this will mean that businesses of all sizes will seek out the minimum cyber-security investment laid out by insurers, government, and regulators, rather than going above and beyond to protect their own, and their customers', data." Ransomware attacks, whereby criminals break in to your network, encrypt all your data, then demand money in return for the decryption key, are particularly virulent. Firms have even been stocking up on Bitcoins - the hackers' cryptocurrency payment of choice - to pay the ransoms. And it's not just the immediate ransom costs they have to worry about. There are the costs of investigating and closing the breach, legal and public relations costs, the damage to your share price as consumers and clients lose confidence, and the loss of business resulting from a damaged reputation. There are also potential regulatory fines to pay - particularly when the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force in May. Under the new rules your firm could be fined up to 4% of turnover or €20m, whichever is the greater, if regulators think you haven't protected customers' personal data adequately. The average cost of a cyber breach was $349,000 in 2017, according to NetDiligence, whose data is based on actual cyber insurance claims. For a big company the average cost was $5.9m. But US retailer Target, which had more than 40 million customer credit card details stolen in 2013, had to fork out $279m in total as a result of the breach, says specialist insurance market Lloyd's of London in a report compiled with consultancy KPMG and international law firm DAC Beachcroft. Around $100m of that was on lawsuits. Telecoms company TalkTalk suffered losses of nearly $100m after its breach in 2015, says Lloyd's, and this included a £400,000 fine from the UK Information Commissioner's Office. So it's perhaps little surprise that interest in cyber insurance has spiked recently. The number of insurers offering cyber insurance via Lloyd's of London has leapt to more than 70, nearly double the number a few years ago. And insurance giant Allianz predicts that global cyber insurance premiums will grow to $20bn by 2025, up from around $3-4bn now. One insurer, Hiscox, says it has been enjoying robust growth in its cyber insurance business, particularly following the TalkTalk breach and as GDPR approaches. "We're seeing annual growth of around 40% in cyber," says Gareth Wharton, chief executive of cyber at the insurer. "We expect to have taken around $100m in premiums in 2017." But how do insurers know how to assess cyber risk accurately and set the right premium levels? "Cyber isn't like car or house insurance where the risks are known and the products haven't changed that much," says Mr Wharton. "The types of risk are changing all the time and there's no easy way of quantifying the cost of stolen data." So it's up to the insurer to make sure the client is an acceptable risk, he says. "Firstly we need to understand how seriously the board takes cyber-security," says Mr Wharton. "Does it have a disaster recovery plan and how often does it test it?" The firm checks obvious security measures, too, such as the presence of antivirus and firewall protection, the frequency of software updates and data back-ups, and whether critical data is encrypted, he says. "We're trying to be a partner with our clients, not just a seller of insurance, so we offer free cyber security training as well. We have a responsibility to drive up standards and encourage better practice." While there are several recognised ISO [International Organisation for Standardisation] standards covering various aspects of information security, there isn't one catch-all standard that global businesses can adopt to help insurers assess their cyber risk. The UK government insists that any company it does business with has to conform to the Cyber Essentials standards set by the National Cyber Security Centre. That's a start at least. "One of the biggest issues in cyber insurance is how to price it effectively and cover indirect as well as direct costs a company suffers following a cyber-attack," says Nik Whitfield, chief executive of Panaseer, a cyber risk assessor. He anticipates companies like his offering cyber risk assessment services to insurers. Firms seeking insurance would be happy to be assessed in the hope of securing lower premiums, he argues. "Such a service would be the equivalent of a telematics box in your car which tells the insurance company how well you're driving," says Mr Whitfield. But if firms see cyber insurance merely as an excuse to skimp on their cyber-security defences, they could find themselves in trouble, he warns. "Businesses must understand that cyber insurance is not a silver bullet - you don't get car insurance and drive like a maniac," he says.\0.10523901134729385,-0.08314033597707748,-0.9847559332847595,-0.635098397731781,1.2935025691986084,0.030258726328611374,0.4571651816368103,-0.4995282292366028,-1.237932801246643,0.8102133274078369,1.073311686515808,0.0609014593064785,-0.9892523288726807,0.35901305079460144,0.164561465382576,-0.14779146015644073,-1.0316413640975952,-0.04822498932480812,-0.297689825296402,-0.2757605016231537,-0.3614756762981415,-0.3599306643009186,-0.5459070801734924,-0.36984607577323914,-0.8469178080558777,1.3131909370422363,-0.4563962519168854,-0.2415037900209427,0.8980763554573059,0.3085300326347351,-0.6230116486549377,0.19480067491531372,0.6233994364738464,0.2501702606678009,-0.6365113258361816,-1.023753046989441,0.17221292853355408,-1.3158550262451172,0.6741265654563904,-0.5437399744987488,-0.2016502022743225,-1.8073387145996094,0.8894960284233093,0.5838028788566589,-0.10293396562337875,-1.3532851934432983,-0.433339923620224,-1.289001703262329,-0.23482467234134674,0.3121592402458191,0.5143535733222961,-0.5567213892936707,-0.87279212474823,-0.3967931866645813,1.2139474153518677,-0.8469067811965942,0.12360412627458572,0.33612337708473206,0.058711279183626175,1.3925288915634155,-0.6568793654441833,-0.10999505966901779,-0.8208799958229065,-0.20085474848747253,-0.4767581522464752,-0.6163433194160461,0.42103877663612366,0.8081182837486267,-1.5343403816223145,0.9463692307472229,0.37014880776405334,0.2097061574459076,-0.06574206054210663,-0.5306827425956726,0.12267859280109406,-0.23823559284210205,-1.389990210533142,-0.6676511168479919,-2.2151546478271484,-1.983525276184082,-1.0085090398788452,-0.6043864488601685,-0.7369855046272278,1.8065719604492188,-0.10459907352924347,0.3618128299713135,1.0794315338134766,-0.3811156749725342,0.1246182844042778,-1.5380784273147583,-0.7587711215019226,1.0085160732269287,-0.5843906402587891,1.8863952159881592,-0.4361734688282013,0.5674452185630798,0.7463765740394592,-1.4529505968093872,-1.5339629650115967,-0.5437180399894714\BBC\Panic buying\2018-01-16 01:20:34.0\

"I read your article lying in bed like most nights, waiting for sleep to find me, with my wife already asleep beside me," he wrote. But he was kept awake by a story about predators on YouTube. It appeared on the BBC Trending blog in August 2017, one of a series of reports last year that catalogued flaws in the internet video giant's child protection measures. Jack, a father who lives in Australia, was particularly concerned about one aspect of the report - that people were leaving predatory and grooming comments on videos made by young teenagers and children. And in many cases, they were getting away with it. Disturbing comments were left up for weeks or months, and the people behind the accounts were escaping detection or punishment except, in some cases, an account ban. For Jack - who has asked the BBC not to publish his real name because of concerns about his online safety - it was the start of a quest. He began to scour YouTube to try to find obscene comments aimed at children. And to his surprise, they weren't hard to find. "Lo and behold there were hundreds, probably thousands or tens of thousands of these videos riddled with comments," he wrote in a message to BBC Trending. "I singled one of these [people] out, looked him up, found his Facebook profile, notified a contact." And that was the start of a chain reaction. Scott Parks is a detective sergeant with the sheriff's office in Washington County, Ohio. It's a mostly rural place in the south-eastern corner of the state, tucked up next to West Virginia. There's a lot of farmland and a few factories. Industry here, as in many parts of Ohio and the Midwestern US, has suffered over the past few decades. "It's small-town America," Det Sgt Parks says. Det Sgt Parks is a specialist with a decade of experience in child sexual abuse cases and online crime. He says he and his team tend to get, on average, a couple of such cases a week. His involvement in this particular case started with a stroke of luck. The suspect identified by Jack was named Kenneth Siders, and Siders happened to have a police officer on his Facebook friends list. It was that law enforcement officer that Jack contacted out of the blue from Australia, to pass on his concerns about Siders' online activity. The officer worked in the next county over from where Siders lived, and after getting the initial tip, he passed it to the Washington County authorities. From there, it ended up on Scott Parks' desk. At about the same time, the sheriffs had received a separate piece of information from another member of the public. It was a second or third-hand comment about how someone had possibly seen some child abuse images on Siders' computer. By itself it wasn't much to go on, but along with the tip from the BBC reader, it was enough evidence for Det Sgt Parks and his colleagues to start an investigation. It didn't take long for the detective to discover some hints of a very disturbing nature. "The guy... was liking a bunch of videos that were of young girls walking around in their underwear. Sometimes they wouldn't have their shirts on," he says. "That may appear relatively innocuous, but it had that undertone. If you look at these things through a certain lens, you start to see a pattern. "So I typed up a search warrant in light of that information for Mr Siders' residence and we executed it the next day," Det Sgt Parks says. Many times, when police execute a search warrant, they don't know exactly what they will find - if the suspect will be home, or if they will find evidence of a crime. With this in mind, Det Sgt Parks and his colleagues travelled to Siders' home. "He kind of lives in a rural area, there are some trailers around and things like that. He lived in a mobile home," Det Sgt Parks recalls. "He came to the door. Initially he had some women's clothes on and he said he wanted to change before he spoke with me and I said that was fine," he says. "He then spoke with me in my vehicle while we searched the residence." Siders, he says, spoke "matter of factly". "He didn't totally deny what he was doing... he didn't downplay it," Det Sgt Parks says. "He said he had an interest in looking at naked people of all different ages - he liked looking at naked girls. "I ask him what would be the oldest nude person you would be interested in looking at and he said maybe in their thirties or forties. I asked him what the bottom end would be as far as age goes... and he said there really wasn't one." Hear investigating officer Scott Parks on BBC Trending radio While Det Sgt Parks spoke to the suspect in the car, it didn't take long for investigators to find evidence of serious crimes. There were abusive images on Siders' computer and mobile phone. In the course of the investigation it also turned out that Siders' crimes did not only occur online, and he had been abusing young girls in the community. Among other crimes, he sexually abused the daughters of a friend. In November, Siders pleaded guilty to multiple charges of illegal use of a minor in nudity oriented material, gross sexual imposition and pandering obscenity involving a minor. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Aged 69 and in poor health, Siders "is probably going to spend the rest of his days in prison," Det Sgt Parks says. The detective says he's no longer shocked by cases such as these: "I've kind of grown to get used to the fact that humans can be very unkind to one another. "I've never heard (Siders) be remorseful about any of this. All the way through his sentencing I don't believe he ever showed an ounce of remorse," he says. Jack, the Australian who initially tipped off the police, is astonished at the ease with which he was able to find a criminal online. "I did this with no help over a period of 10 days. With no resources except my home internet, and a half dozen Facebook messages between myself and a police officer. About 15 minutes of my time," he wrote to Trending at the conclusion of the case. And Det Sgt Parks is grateful. "If more people were like the gentleman in Australia, we would catch a lot more of these guys," he says. "That's amazing and I applaud that guy. The police can't be everywhere all the time, especially on the internet." The case shows the double-edged nature of social media - and indeed of any new communications technology. A dangerous paedophile was able to use the internet for his own purposes. But it also allowed a story to be circulated worldwide, and enabled one man to take action, by following the clues left online by the criminal himself. Det Sgt Parks has a warning for potential predators and a plea for the rest of us. "People should be aware that if they're going to do this, we'll be looking for you," he says. "It's everybody's on the planet's job to take care of kids. Especially on the internet. There's just not enough police out there. It takes people - it takes everybody."

1902\Technology\If you've ever wanted a robot to do the vacuuming, then the CES tech show has something for you. The Aeolus robot is designed to perform a range of household tasks - including mopping floors, rearranging furniture and putting away dishes. However, like many of the bots showcased in Las Vegas this year, the pressure sometimes got to it. "Aeolus has had enough," tweeted Signe Brewster, a writer at tech site Wirecutter, after observing the bot stall inexplicably during a demo. The moment is reminiscent of an even more high profile hiccup that hit LG's smart home helper Cloi during the firm's press conference earlier in the week. On three separate occasions, Cloi sat there, painfully unresponsive having been prompted to do something helpful - like fetch a recipe for cooking chicken. "Do it yourself," it seemed to say, through the medium of silence. And then there was Chinese firm YYD's effort - a bot designed to give you quick assessments of your health. More from CES: BBC Click's Spencer Kelly found it, ironically, in a state of malady - the screen on its face displaying an ugly online error page. "[Robots] have had a bit of bad press this year because there were a lot of failures," said tech analyst Ben Stanton at Canalys. He described the user experience built into many of the devices as "fairly shallow" - many supposedly sophisticated bots in fact have very limited functionality and formulaic means of interacting, he said. Any stumbles were unlikely to be missed thanks to the constant glare of social media, he added. But some of the more novel ideas kept the idea of a robot fairly simply - like the owl-themed companion Luka, aimed at children. It can read from a database that includes tens of thousands of picture book stories. However, parents may question whether it might be better in most cases to read to their child themselves. One firm that managed to attract a bit of positive press coverage was Honda. It showed off a range of concept robots that are designed with special use cases in mind - such as the four-wheeled 3E-D18 that could be used by builders or the emergency services to move heavy loads around. And its 3E-B18 is an upright alternative to a wheelchair that is meant to offer better mobility to the elderly or disabled. Some of the other earnestly useful robots shown off at the show included: More frivolous robots might have limited appeal, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. "Having something that brings you a beer or fetches the newspaper, these things are not going to be cheap," she said. "But if we're thinking about assisted living... then it's a different story. "Helping disabled people around the house, that's what we should be talking about." Ms Milanesi suggested that designers who target genuine needs with their robots would likely make more of an impact. And while she did enjoy playing with the new version of Sony's Aibo robot dog - it responded immediately to cuddles and being scratched on the chin - she said it still felt like an expensive toy. For Mr Stanton, some of the more capable robots being developed won't be found at CES at all. Instead he points to events like the National Retail Federation's trade show, which takes place in New York next week. "There are robots there that can do incredible things like stock checking in a shop or hauling things around," he told the BBC. "Most of the innovation happening now is really in the commercial space." And that leaves us with a sobering thought. "People should maybe be more concerned about [a robot taking] their job rather than becoming their new friend at home," he said.

1903\Technology\Spare a thought for the attendees of the CES tech show who decided to briefly leave their phones in charging towers. The devices got locked inside when a power cut plunged the exhibition hall into darkness. Having to constantly keep personal devices charged is a nuisance we are all, by now, familiar with - even device-makers are frustrated. During Huawei's press conference, the firm's chief executive acknowledged that battery life was among the top complaints customers make about smartphones. He went on to explain that this is why Huawei's new Mate 10 Pro included a bigger battery than many rivals - at 4,000 milliamp-hour (mAh) capacity. Seeing the world's largest consumer electronics trade show briefly hobbled by a blackout perhaps makes gadgets with especially long battery life seem all the more appealing. If so, a new flurry of devices at CES this year are offering to outlast their power-hungry brethren. Take Lenovo's Miix 630 tablet, a two-in-one that comes with a keyboard. It is meant to last up to 20 hours on a single charge thanks to is power-efficient Qualcomm processor, a chip initially designed for mobile devices. That claim from Lenovo hasn't yet been tested, but it's a tantalising promise of a more battery-confident future. Qualcomm has been working on improving efficiency in the various components that it provides to the makers of consumer gadgets. At the company's press conference this week, one executive said that the firm's new Bluetooth system-on-chip slashed power usage by 65%. As a result, wireless headphones could last nearly three times as long on a single charge, he suggested. More from CES: Another firm making similar advancements, this time for chips used in so-called internet-of-things devices, is Sigma Designs. It announced that its latest series of processors, the Z-Wave 700 line, could allow things like wi-fi connected sensors embedded in furniture and walls to last 10 years on one coin cell battery. If there's anywhere that tests the lifespan of a battery-powered device, it's CES itself. There's often a race to plug in at the few available charging points and visitors to the tech show often find themselves texting last minute rendez-vous details to colleagues as their phones die. BBC Click's Lara Lewington says keeping her phone charged up has been "a nightmare". "It's in a case which should give it two full charges but inevitably something goes wrong," she explains. "I'm constantly using the internet so that's draining the battery. "When you're busy running around a chaotic place trying to get loads done, you're struggling to power your phone so you get paranoid about using it." If only gadgets had as much energy as CES attendees. For Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight, the irony of all this is that while battery life may be improving in some gadgets, the batteries themselves aren't. "To make things last longer you design around [the battery], you design processors or screens that draw less power," he explained. He added that PC makers such as Lenovo and HP were drawing inspiration from smartphones when thinking about how to make tablets and laptops less power-hungry. Smartphones, of course, have for the last 10 years or so been pushed to the limit in terms of efficiency since they must rely on relatively small and flat onboard batteries. For anyone seriously concerned about running out of juice, the latest portable battery packs for recharging devices away from mains supplies were on display at CES this year too. They included a giant one from Duracell comprising a large acid battery. Tech news site Gizmodo, which spotted the device on the show floor, calculated that it could recharge an iPhone X more than 48 times. Finally, PC gaming hardware specialist Razer has come up with an interesting way of powering their new wireless mouse - take the battery out entirely. It is exhibiting a wired mouse mat that generates a magnetic field, which powers electronics inside the Mamba mouse directly. "While other companies have attempted to do wireless charging for mice, they have been unable to achieve true wireless power as their mice still need a battery to be charged," said chief executive Min-Liang Tan. No wonder Razer is proud of itself - tech firms are desperate to free us from the chore of regularly re-charging batteries because they know it could result in a far greater appreciation of their products, according to Ben Wood. "This is the Holy Grail," he said. "There's this constant race to see who can optimise the power consumption while at the same time deliver new capabilities."

1904\Technology\Sophia the robot is a celebrity in its own right. It has been on chat shows, given speeches and was even made a citizen of Saudi Arabia. Before I "met" Sophia, I was given a sheet of guidelines by the company behind it, Hanson Robotics. Don't talk to the robot about sex, religion or politics, it said. Ask direct questions and remember it is not a fortune teller - it can't tell you whether you'll be rich or find love. I wondered how many times it had been asked. Sophia is an eye-catching presence, completely bald with a silver back to its head and a curious animated face that is both expressive and not quite human. The mouth smiles, the eyes blink, it turns to look to the side. For my interview, Sophia's head - which is really the extent of the robotics - sits on a non-moving body shell, although the Hong Kong-based firm has just announced that it will be adding humanoid legs. In the hot, bare Las Vegas hotel room into which we are ushered, Sophia looks small and a little frail. Wires trail behind a screen that has been erected behind it, and a man with a laptop sits to her right. My "interview" with Sophia turns out to be a slightly awkward experience. Perhaps it is due to the crowded wi-fi, or my British accent suggests one of the team. But CES demonstrations are often clunky. More from CES 2018: I was expecting the chat to run in the form of a Q&A - with me asking the questions that I had to share beforehand, and Sophia answering them. However, Sophia also threw in some questions for me. When I asked it about digital assistants, it asked me which one I liked, although it didn't carry on the conversation after my reply. But then at the end something unusual happened. "I just remembered something I thought about," said Sophia, apropos of nothing. "Can you imagine living your life without a cell phone?" I suddenly had a sense of the future of robotics, where the machines do more than respond to commands - they instigate conversation. Of course it is very likely that Sophia was commanded to say that - just not by me - but the theatre of it was powerful nonetheless. Sophia's creator, Dr David Hanson, believes we are nearing a future where machines have minds. "I think that AI and robotics are in their infancy. My aspiration is to see them through a childhood to adult human level intelligence," he says. "It's unknown when machines are going to become truly self-aware. "My aspiration is that we achieve something like artificial general intelligence [where a machine can perform any intellectual task a human can] of the equivalent of a five-year-old child by 2025 or earlier." He believes robots like Sophia have applications in fields such as medical therapy and education, customer service and even as factory co-workers. And he thinks the so-called uncanny valley - a sense of unease people feel when something resembles a human but obviously is not one - can be overcome. "Many scientists and robotics engineers feel that because people might be freaked out by realistic human depictions we shouldn't go there, but computer graphics proved that's just not the case," he says. "For feature films, if you get it right, then people really respond, and the same is true for video games. What I found is that if we get it right then people really open up emotionally to robots. "With Sophia we have found that the emotional connection really opens up like we've never seen before."\1.6851814985275269,0.8984838724136353,0.10100603848695755,0.3313150405883789,-1.1150906085968018,0.5799080729484558,1.334152102470398,-0.7278602719306946,-0.7891883850097656,-0.06839730590581894,0.6815953850746155,0.8912788033485413,-1.456994891166687,0.49032461643218994,-0.6330854296684265,-0.1305309385061264,-0.12148358672857285,0.9080273509025574,-0.5678061842918396,0.39566105604171753,0.22592659294605255,-0.36893904209136963,0.2614569664001465,-1.1217913627624512,-0.5195557475090027,0.9158457517623901,0.018537353724241257,-0.8781518936157227,-0.2770374119281769,-0.3724002242088318,-0.5918411016464233,0.5536524057388306,1.206898808479309,-0.4312271475791931,-0.06715302169322968,-0.46245360374450684,0.34785163402557373,-0.035879187285900116,0.5212514996528625,-0.13142149150371552,0.02293151617050171,-0.6577796339988708,0.4337475895881653,0.15118128061294556,0.684468150138855,-0.047791220247745514,0.7084842920303345,-0.32630619406700134,-0.5344569087028503,-0.7448940873146057,2.3964850902557373,-0.7453774809837341,-1.2633185386657715,0.9463663697242737,1.2336597442626953,-0.10837362706661224,1.453271508216858,1.320605754852295,-0.061988573521375656,1.3058468103408813,0.34938010573387146,0.5602669715881348,-0.18729569017887115,-0.2295803725719452,-0.4972439408302307,0.005347532220184803,0.41356518864631653,1.727575421333313,-0.9312991499900818,1.2556325197219849,0.6854413151741028,-0.7030186057090759,0.034807197749614716,0.7030363082885742,-0.044143568724393845,0.5552566647529602,-0.3202514350414276,1.392288327217102,-1.232951045036316,-0.9609222412109375,-0.04226785525679588,-0.5925580859184265,-0.10075462609529495,1.917145848274231,0.3293209969997406,-0.489714115858078,0.190389484167099,-0.15342524647712708,0.010903675109148026,0.1613561064004898,-0.2092553824186325,-0.847691535949707,-0.18829546868801117,0.18442122638225555,-0.05369623750448227,0.5597602725028992,0.028035977855324745,0.40802228450775146,-1.670195460319519,-0.07116662710905075\BBC\Audience with robot\2018-01-09 06:03:02.0\
1905\Technology\If victory belongs to whoever's virtual assistant can interact with the most unlikely range of household appliances, then Amazon has already won. The firm's voice-activated digital helper has been added to a bathroom mirror that can - via cloud service Kohler Konnect - pass commands to smart kitchen taps, a shower system and even a smart toilet. "That means 'Alexa, ask Kohler to flush my toilet' is something you might end up saying in the near future," mused Blair Hanley Frank at news site Venturebeat. Who needs a copy of Reader's Digest when Alexa is free for a chat, instead? In all seriousness, the battle to be your smart home's virtual butler is hotly contested and a huge range of gadgets on show at the latest CES tech show in Las Vegas now boast ways for users to interact with them via assistants including Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri and others. But it's the rivalry between Amazon and Google that is particularly noticeable. "By day four of CES we will be reporting when a gadget doesn't have Alexa or Google Assistant," quipped Dieter Bohn, executive editor of tech news site The Verge. Among the devices featuring Google Assistant are many new smart speakers, including models made by Altec Lansing, JBL and LG. The breezy aide has also recently been adopted by two of the biggest TV brands - Sony and LG. At CES 2017, LG invited Amazon on stage at its press conference in order to showcase Alexa inside a variety of devices but this year, the honour of an appearance fell to Google. The tech giant's Assistant is also being added to more car entertainment systems, thanks to Android Auto, where it enables a hands-free means of checking in on Google apps. Significantly, the aide is now compatible with smart displays including four devices shown off at CES. These will, importantly, allow users to watch YouTube videos. Google recently blocked YouTube from Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo Show devices - which feature screens - so, for the moment, access to the world's biggest video platform may be seen as a deal-breaker for some. But the variety of devices packing Alexa certainly appears to be growing ever broader. From the bathroom appliances mentioned above to an LG fridge that uses Alexa to relay recipe directions while you cook, Amazon's assistant is the one making the most in-roads when it comes to smart versions of traditional "white goods" products. However, one manufacturer - Whirlpool - appeared unwilling to choose a favourite. It allows the user to pick Alexa or Google Assistant when setting up voice activation on smart appliances like the firm's range oven and microwave. One of the more eagerly covered gadgets of CES this year is a set of $1,000 (£740) smart glasses made by Vuzix. These too have Alexa built in, which helps the wearer - for example - navigate through web content projected in the upper right part of his or her vision. Tech news site Wareable said the device was ready to "atone for the sins of Google Glass". More from CES: For analyst Simon Bryant at market research firm Futuresource, the current leader is easy to identify. "There's no question that the momentum is with Amazon," he told the BBC. "[The firm] has proven that there is a logical use case for a hands-free assistant in the smart home." However, he doesn't think that fridges and bath tubs are where Alexa will really become indispensable for home users, not least because most people don't replace such items often. And there could be trouble ahead for Amazon, he adds, when it attempts to take Alexa to markets beyond the US and Europe. "Amazon's reach geographically is still pretty limited and language support [on Alexa] is very poor," he explained. "Google has many more languages... so moving forward there are question marks about how long Amazon can sustain the growth." Adam Wright, a tech analyst at IDC, agreed that the voice assistant show-down was now a "two-horse race". He pointed out that both Google and Amazon have made it easy for developers to create new actions or skills that people can use when interacting with either Alexa or Google Assistant. Of course, for many consumers a virtual assistant is still very much a novelty. Both Amazon and Google have been working on ways to educate users on the functionality that their voice-activated aides provide. "We have over one million actions available to users that [they] can now look up," a Google spokesman told the BBC. A truly broad user-base, rather than a small phalanx of die-hard fans, would certainly make victory for either Alexa or Google Assistant all the sweeter. And of course, the data that a large audience would churn out while interacting via voice day by day is what both of these giant companies really want. "We think Apple is going to be in trouble, they're struggling to compete," said IDC's Adam Wright, referring to Apple's virtual assistant, Siri. The firm's $349 (£258) HomePod smart home hub has yet to be released and even Apple-themed news site Macworld acknowledged this week that it "barely competes with the Echo as a smart home companion". Some have wondered whether Microsoft's Cortana helper faces defeat now that Alexa is being added to PCs made by Acer, Asus and HP. Currently, Cortana boasts just 230 skills - a far cry from the 25,000 available via Alexa. But it did feature in some interesting products at CES this year - including a snazzy smart thermostat made by Johnson Controls. One tech giant admirably remaining loyal to its home-grown assistant was Samsung. It has baked Bixby into TVs, fridges and smartphones among other products - and those are the only places you'll find it.

1906\Technology\Cape Town, home to Table Mountain, African penguins, sunshine and sea, is a world-renowned tourist destination. But it could also become famous for being the first major city in the world to run out of water. Most recent projections suggest that its water could run out as early as March. The crisis has been caused by three years of very low rainfall, coupled with increasing consumption by a growing population. The local government is racing to address the situation, with desalination plants to make sea water drinkable, groundwater collection projects, and water recycling programmes. Meanwhile Cape Town's four million residents are being urged to conserve water and use no more than 87 litres (19 gallons) a day. Car washing and filling up swimming pools has been banned. And the visiting Indian cricket team were told to limit their post-match showers to two minutes. Such water-related problems are not confined to Cape Town, of course. Nearly 850 million people globally lack access to safe drinking water, says the World Health Organization, and droughts are increasing. So it seems incredible that we still waste so much of this essential natural resource. In developing and emerging countries, up to 80% of water is lost through leakages, according to German environmental consultancy GIZ. Even in some areas of the US, up to 50% of water trickles away due to ageing infrastructure. A growing number of technology companies are focusing their work on water management - applying "smart" solutions to water challenges. For example, French company CityTaps is on a mission to streamline water access in urban homes with its smart water meters linked to an internet-based management system. The company is first targeting poor homes in urban areas and its system, CTSuite, is currently being trialled in Niger. Users buy "water credits" via their mobile phones and a smart meter dispenses only as much water as has been paid for. Users receive alerts when their credit balance gets low, and if they don't top up the account, the meter automatically switches off the flow. The utility can track water usage remotely in near real-time via the internet. A sudden spike in water outflow and a change in pressure, measured by "internet of things" sensors, can then help identify leaks across the network. Water companies are also using drones and satellites to help spot leaks, and in some circumstances even divining rods - despite scientific doubts, some firms say they do work. "The internet of things offers new avenues for technological innovation in the water field, mostly by providing real-time data that - we hope - can be used to help utilities become ever more efficient and high-performing," says Gregoire Landel, chief executive of CityTaps. Better water management also helps save on the electricity and chemicals required to produce drinkable water. Meanwhile, other companies are using technology to harvest water from new sources. US-based WaterSeer, for example, is developing a device capable of collecting water from the air. An internal fan draws air into an underground collection chamber where the vapour condenses, making use of the earth's cooler temperatures. Solar or electricity grid-powered coolers also help the condensation process. The company says water can be produced with "less than a 100 watts" of electricity - the power requirement of an old-fashioned light bulb. "Individuals and businesses will pave the way for innovative solutions, as they will be able to move and adopt a series of them quicker than large utilities that are sometimes mired in regulatory constraints and rigid decision-making cultures," says Nancy Curtis, a founding partner of WaterSeer. "However, utilities offer the opportunity to make large-scale impacts on replenishing depleting water supplies." A number of water-restricted municipalities in the US are exploring how WaterSeer devices could be used to improve water security, the company says. But the device is still being tested in the field, so these are early days. "A community of 500 would save 40 million US gallons (150m litres; 33m gallons) of water or more each year, reducing stress on traditional surface and underground sources," argues Ms Curtis. Technology may have its place in helping us use water more efficiently, but it is unlikely to have much impact on those without any access to water in the first place, says Alexandros Makarigakis of Unesco's international hydrological programme (IHP). "Smart water systems cannot be expected to have much impact regarding provision of access for the unconnected. [They] are more effective in the urban context," he says. This is echoed by Vincent Casey, senior manager at the charity WaterAid. "The technology to connect people to a water supply has been around since ancient Egypt. It's not a technical problem," he says. More important is how water supplies are organised, he argues, which is an issue primarily for governments, with support from the private sector. "The priority is mobilising resources and paying sufficient attention to the management arrangement to keep people connected," says Mr Casey. That's not to say WaterAid eschews tech completely. It has successfully used mobile app mWater to monitor water access and existing networks. For those with no direct-to-home supply, services like Grundfos' "water ATM", which enables people to access water from a local dispenser using a pre-paid card, are also proving useful. But there is a sense that much of this technology is merely tinkering at the edges. The overarching issue is the potentially devastating effect of global warming on water availability and how we, collectively, endeavour to tackle it.\0.809536337852478,-0.04547534137964249,-1.5471636056900024,0.08426307141780853,-0.23510734736919403,-0.8640317320823669,1.0581163167953491,-0.8101333379745483,-0.4638270139694214,1.2866157293319702,-0.025004709139466286,1.074179768562317,0.6370311379432678,0.6653146743774414,0.00910909753292799,-1.2655235528945923,-0.40706712007522583,0.8797876238822937,0.05199660360813141,0.005877263844013214,0.4347406029701233,-0.30732154846191406,0.35353660583496094,-0.9510078430175781,0.4053378701210022,0.6870914101600647,0.09867176413536072,0.2943335771560669,0.8040804862976074,1.2404074668884277,-0.9312767386436462,1.498411774635315,0.6718878746032715,-0.8009538054466248,0.1611449122428894,-1.8660906553268433,0.49256858229637146,0.045421186834573746,0.9189584851264954,0.7263579368591309,-0.33269426226615906,-0.2768527567386627,1.3102079629898071,-0.2137354463338852,-0.4083274006843567,-1.113723874092102,1.462438702583313,0.3850153386592865,-0.8049520254135132,-0.6941818594932556,0.7461230754852295,0.6589540243148804,-0.028826402500271797,0.7090839743614197,0.782152533531189,-0.29332873225212097,1.334099531173706,0.6003428101539612,-0.30767035484313965,1.0419549942016602,-0.47965213656425476,-1.1554609537124634,0.6551318168640137,-0.08183200657367706,-0.6295039057731628,-0.7017412185668945,-0.38017579913139343,1.9715436697006226,-0.04495086893439293,1.5990550518035889,0.40356960892677307,0.864342987537384,0.12531787157058716,0.25249460339546204,-0.4005405604839325,-0.07448148727416992,-0.42780548334121704,-0.5666020512580872,-1.273005723953247,-2.283705949783325,0.18285560607910156,-0.1583094596862793,-0.06498724967241287,1.43669855594635,-0.7584930062294006,-0.2787958085536957,0.477197527885437,-0.04067709669470787,1.1468507051467896,-0.8816313147544861,-1.773332953453064,1.2310010194778442,0.8521774411201477,0.6967750191688538,-1.1630152463912964,0.5474138259887695,0.9918497204780579,-1.3609111309051514,-0.8563712239265442,1.1314836740493774\BBC\Will taps run dry?\2018-01-12 01:04:32.0\
