1001	Amazon Prime memberships are getting more expensive for those customers who want the flexibility to pay for the speedy shipping and media streaming program on a monthly basis.The company is announcing on Friday that the Amazon Prime monthly fee is increasing from $10.99 to $12.99 in the U.S., an increase of 18 percent. The new price works out to nearly $156 a year.The increase comes less than two years after Amazon first introduced the monthly payment option as a way to attract new Prime members who either couldn’t afford the annual membership of $99 (which is not increasing), or didn’t want to commit to using the service continuously.As I wrote this summer:The monthly payment option was seen as a way to attract lower-income customers — the type of shopper who might otherwise prefer, say, Walmart — who could not cough up $99 at one time. Since then, Prime membership growth has been the strongest among households making less than $50,000 annually, an R.W. Baird study found.Prime is the engine at the center of the Amazon commerce machine — Prime members buy from Amazon more frequently than non-Prime members and also spend more, hence why Amazon introduced the monthly option to lure new members. So, if the company is raising the fee, you can bet that it discovered that the current $10.99 was just not sustainable.“Prime provides an unparalleled combination of shipping, shopping and entertainment benefits, and we continue to invest in making Prime even more valuable for our members,” the company said in a statement. “The number of items eligible for unlimited Free Two-Day Shipping increased in recent years from 20 million to more than 100 million items. We have expanded Prime Free Same-Day and Prime Free One-Day delivery to more than 8,000 cities and towns. We also continue to introduce new, popular and award-winning Prime Originals ... Members also enjoy a growing list of unique benefits like Prime Music, Prime Reading, exclusive products and much more.”The price of Amazon’s monthly Prime program for students, which just launched this past fall, is also jumping 18 percent — from $5.49 to $6.49.At the same time, the cost of a monthly Prime Video membership, which doesn’t include shipping benefits, will remain at $8.99; the monthly Prime membership option for customers on government assistance will also remain unchanged at $5.99.	podobne	1001,1002,1003,1004,1005,1006,1007,1008,1009
1002	(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) raised the monthly fee for the U.S. version of its fast-shipping and video-streaming service Amazon Prime by $2 on Friday, making the case for subscribers to upgrade to an annual plan.It was the first increase of Prime fees in almost four years and comes at the end of another bullish year and holiday season for Amazon’s dominant online shopping platform.The move also follows a rise in fees by video streaming rival Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) in October.Amazon increased the fee for its monthly plan to $12.99 from $10.99, while maintaining the annual fee at $99. It also hiked the monthly subscription fee for college students to $6.49 from $5.49.“That’s good value, over time they’ve raised the price. I don’t think they will lose many members,” Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said.“Those who use it the most get the most value and won’t mind the higher price and those who don’t use it are not the best customers, so even if they drop off it is not a big loss to Amazon,” he said.As of September, Amazon had about 90 million Prime members in the United States, according to research firm Statista. The company itself does not disclose the number. bit.ly/2Dwhqjw.Netflix has 52.77 million subscribers in the United States and its global tally is 109 million.Existing monthly Prime and Prime Student members will pay the new price for renewals after Feb. 18, Amazon said on its website.Amazon kept monthly subscription fee for its standalone Prime Video membership, which gives members access to original content premium movies and TV shows, unchanged at $8.99. Netflix’s basic subscription plan fee is $7.99 per month.Amazon, which along with Netflix faces competition from Hulu and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) YouTube, has been spending heavily to make original shows.Only Prime has the added dimension of offering subscribers discounts and other benefits from its shopping platform, which help the company lure more buyers.The company shipped over 5 billion items worldwide via the subscription service in 2017 and revenue from subscription fees that include Prime jumped 59 percent to $2.4 billion in the quarter ended Sept.30. The company reports its fourth quarter on Feb. 1.“We only expect to see 2 percent churn from this price increase with many customers moving to the yearly subscription which is the ‘golden goose’ for Bezos & Co as once on the annual plan customers rarely churn,” GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.Amazon’s shares rose 0.5 percent to $1,300 on Friday.	podobne	1001,1002,1003,1004,1005,1006,1007,1008,1009
1003	On Friday, Amazon surprised customers by increasing the price of Amazon Prime for some members.Prime subscribers who pay on a monthly basis will now be charged $12.99, up from $10.99. Monthly Prime Student subscriptions, available to college students, were also subject to a price hike, rising from $5.49 to $6.49 per month.Prices for annual Prime memberships remain unchanged, at $99 per year for regular customers, and $49 per year for students. All Prime members receive free two-day shipping on most Amazon orders, as well as access to unlimited streaming of Amazon video and music content.Obviously, the annual membership is a much better deal for anyone maintaining a Prime subscription over the course of 12 months or more. The total cost of a by-the-month Amazon Prime membership now runs just under $156 for a year, up from around $132.The new price hikes have likely been instituted to nudge monthly Prime members into becoming annual members. Prime members tend to be wealthy, and tend to spend significantly more at Amazon than non-Prime members. But the option of monthly memberships, introduced in 2016, offered customers the possibility of taking advantage of Amazon Prime for only a brief period: People could sign up for a single month—perhaps during the winter holiday shopping season—simply to get free shipping on multiple orders. Amazon could easily be losing money on such Prime customers, assuming they remembered to cancel subscriptions at the end of the month.By jacking up monthly Prime prices, Amazon will at least be extracting more money from these customers—thereby helping the e-retail giant recover some of its shipping costs.Amazon’s monthly Prime price hikes could also help convince some customers that it’s more worthwhile to become annual Prime members. And that’s one of Amazon’s ultimate goals: It wants as many customers to pay for Amazon Prime upfront and in full, and it wants them to be loyal Amazon shoppers year in, year out.	podobne	1001,1002,1003,1004,1005,1006,1007,1008,1009
1004	Amazon hasn’t touched the price of an annual Prime membership in the US since raising it to $99 from $79 in March 2014. That $99 fee has stayed steady even as Prime’s offerings have expanded to include one-hour delivery with Prime Now, photo storage on Prime photos, and plenty more streaming content on Prime music and Prime video.But monthly subscribers are a different matter. Since introducing a month-to-month Prime subscription in April 2016, Amazon has asked those customers to pay a little more for the flexibility: $10.99 a month, or $131.88 a year, a 33% premium over the annual fee. Today (Jan. 19), Amazon said that price is going up. A monthly Prime membership will increase to $12.99, or $155.88 a year, 57% more than the cost of a yearly subscription.The monthly Prime plan is seen as a way for Amazon to appeal to lower income customers, who might not be able to pay $99 at once. (Amazon also offers a $5.99 a month plan to US residents receiving government assistance.) After Amazon introduced the monthly payment option, Prime subscriptions reportedly grew fastest among households earning less than $50,000 a year, according to a study from investment firm R.W. Baird. That means the $2-a-month price increase is likely to hit those subscribers even harder.According to data provided to Quartz by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), a firm that closely tracks Amazon, 31% of US Prime members were paying monthly as of December 2017. That was up from closer to 25% in the three previous quarters.“The problem for Amazon is, at least in the US, Amazon has captured most of the customers that would pay $99 for the annual membership,” Michael Levin, co-founder of CIRP, said in an email. “Most (61%) of the consumers that joined Amazon Prime in 2017 pay monthly, so are at greater risk of leaving.”Amazon doesn’t disclose much useful information about Prime, but third-party analysis has found that the typical Prime customer spends $1,300 a year on Amazon, compared to about $700 a year for non-Prime members. CIRP estimates that the annual Prime fee covers the cost of shipping but that Amazon bears the cost of other Prime extras, like music and video licensing, and relies on greater spending from Prime customers to make the investment pay off.As of the third quarter of 2017, CIRP estimated that 90 million people in the US were Amazon Prime members.	podobne	1001,1002,1003,1004,1005,1006,1007,1008,1009
1005	Amazon Prime is getting a price hike.The tech giant on Friday announced that it has raised the monthly Amazon Prime membership rate from $10.99 per month to $12.99 per month, an increase of 18%. Amazon was quick to note, however, that the $99 annual membership fee for Amazon Prime will remain the same. Students who were paying $5.49 per month for access to Prime will now be charged $6.49.Amazon Prime is one of the company’s most important offerings. Subscribers get access to free two-day shipping on millions of products, as well as discounted rates on next-day shipping. Amazon Prime subscriptions also include access to the company’s suite of streaming services, including Prime Video, Prime Music, and more.Traditionally, Prime has been an annual subscription, but in 2016, Amazon unveiled its monthly plan to attract more members to the program. The move allowed those who couldn’t afford Prime to take advantage of the benefits, and also offered some flexibility in deciding how and when to use it.Amazon doesn’t break out its Prime membership by annual and monthly members, so it’s unknown how many people will be affected by the change. If nothing else, it could provoke some monthly payers to consider an annual membership. By signing up for Prime’s annual plan, users pay just $99. The new monthly rate will cost members about $156 for the year.Amazon did not immediately respond to a Fortune request for comment on the move.	podobne	1001,1002,1003,1004,1005,1006,1007,1008,1009
1006	Those of you paying for Prime month to month will see a higher fee of $12.99. Annual fees will remain the same.If you pay for Amazon Prime membership on a monthly basis, get ready to pay a little more.The online retailer on Friday said it raised the monthly fee for Prime to $12.99 from $10.99, up 18 percent and effective immediately. The monthly student rate increased to $6.49 from $5.49. Customers using the monthly option will start paying the higher price on their first payment after Feb. 18.The good news is that if you pay for Prime annually, whether the $99 full price or $49 student rate, your costs won't increase. The monthly option for customers using government aid didn't change, either.Customers of the Prime service, now estimated to reach 90 million US households,  routinely spend about twice as much on Amazon as non-Prime shoppers. With Prime serving as Amazon's engine for retail sales and customer loyalty, any price hikes come with risk of a blowback from consumers. But, with Amazon's shipping costs constantly increasing, the e-commerce giant also needs to balance customer satisfaction against its own bottom line.An Amazon spokeswoman said the increase resulted from Prime members' "tremendous appetite" for Prime benefits including unlimited two-day shipping, as well as Amazon's continued investment in Prime perks.Friday's price increase is the first one Amazon has instituted since it created the monthly payment option in April 2016. Monthly payments were already more expensive for customers than the annual price, amounting to $131.88 a year. The total yearly cost will now be $155.88.Since introducing Prime in 2005, Amazon has raised the annual membership fee just once, to $99 from $79 in 2014. The annual membership continues to be the more popular payment option, partly because it's been around much longer than the monthly option.Netflix, which offers a rival streaming video service, in October raised subscription prices for most US viewers, marking its first US rate increase in two years."This isn't really a surprise," Forrester analyst Brendan Witcher said of the Amazon price increase, noting that retailers routinely introduce new services and then tweak the pricing.He added that the change could result in more people switching to an annual membership and perhaps slower growth for Prime in 2018. Amazon's spokeswoman said the company is "indifferent" to whether people pay annually or monthly.Amazon in recent years has seen strong growth in Prime sign-ups, though the company still doesn't disclose specific figures on Prime memberships. Amazon said in January that "more new paid members joined Prime worldwide this year than any previous year."Witcher said he doesn't see Amazon raising the $99 annual fee, which would push the price above the psychologically significant $100 mark."The $99 fee seems to work for Amazon right now," he said, "and I expect them to hold that line as long as it brings customers into the service."The Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you, and the things around you, smarter.'Alexa, be more human': Inside Amazon's effort to make its voice assistant smarter, chattier and more like you.	podobne	1001,1002,1003,1004,1005,1006,1007,1008,1009
1007	Get ready to pay more for your Amazon Prime monthly membership, because the company is  raising its prices by nearly 20%. According to Recode, the company is announcing that it will raise the price on monthly Amazon Prime fees from $10.99 to $12.99 in the U.S., or almost $156 a year, an increase of 18%. Amazon’s student Prime membership is also jumping 18%—from $5.49 to $6.49. The changes go into effect today for new customers, while existing customers will see the increase on their February bill.So if you want to make the most of Amazon’s free two-day shipping, Amazon Video (minus One Mississippi, or course), Amazon Music, or get a discount at Whole Foods, you’re going to have to fork over more of your paycheck each month to Jeff Bezos, who is already the richest person in the world.The company is mostly likely increasing the price of its monthly Prime membership to make signing up for Prime’s annual subscription—which is still priced at $99 (or $49 for students)—look like a much better deal. The annual subscription gives Amazon a more guaranteed revenue stream, and that fancy new second headquarters isn’t going to pay for itself	podobne	1001,1002,1003,1004,1005,1006,1007,1008,1009
1008	When a company like Amazon raises the prices for its service and nobody cares, CNBC's Jim Cramer sees a clear next move."When you see something like that, it's about as clear a buy signal as you are ever, ever, ever going to get," the "Mad Money" host said on Friday after Amazon upped the price of its monthly Prime membership rate by 18 percent.The price boost — from $10.99 to $12.99 for full-paying members — will total $156 a year, a "smart" move considering Amazon's yearly membership rate of $99 will remain the same, Cramer said."It's basically a tax on people who only pay month-to-month," he said.Better yet, Cramer expected no resistance "whatsoever" to the price increase thanks to the quality and value that Amazon's Prime service provides.I bet most people don't even notice the price hike, he said. "That's why Amazon remains a go-to name for anyone who needs a high-growth stock to round out their portfolio."The same goes for Netflix, Cramer argued. Nobody cared or resisted when the streaming giant raised the price of its 4K plan, which offers higher quality content, to $13.99 a month."Given that I pay $24 for two seats in a movie theater — $24 for a couple of maybe lousy hours of entertainment, pre-popcorn-and-candy, by the way — I'm thrilled to shell out a little more than just half that to binge on quality homegrown programming ... for a whole month," Cramer said.Customers of Costco, which boasts some of the biggest bargains on the market, also tend to overlook when the big-box retailer raises the price of its membership cards, Cramer noted.Apple's cloud service revenues also fall into this category. If privately-held music app Spotify ever comes public, its subscription-based service likely will, too, he said.The next time you get hit with a price increase and it doesn't bother you one bit, you need to pay up for the stock of that company in question, maybe even the next day, the "Mad Money" host concluded. "In every instance I just mentioned ... it's been worth it."	podobne	1001,1002,1003,1004,1005,1006,1007,1008,1009
1009	If you subscribe to Amazon Prime through their monthly plan today may be the day to look at switching over to a yearly subscriptions. Starting today Amazon Prime members who pay monthly for the service will see their payments jump from $10.99 a month to 12.99 a month. ($155.88 a year) If you pay for an early annual membership the cost will still be just $99 a year a $56.88 savings.With Amazon Prime, you get the 2-day free shipping on orders sold by Amazon but there is a lot more that comes with the membership. Subscribers get access to Amazon Prime Video with a growing list of movies and TV shows and now NFL Thursday Night Football. Prime offers exclusive access to deals on Amazon that non-members do not get. You can also get access to over a thousand top Kindle books for free with Prime and early access to new books every month.It does not stop their Prime members also get access to unlimited free photos. Love music? Well with Prime you get access to a collection of music for free as part of your Amazon Prime membership.Amazon did not say what pushed them to change the monthly cost of Prime but it seems clear that they would prefer you to subscribe to the yearly membership.	podobne	1001,1002,1003,1004,1005,1006,1007,1008,1009
2001	The giant black hole at the center of a distant galaxy has been spotted taking in gas and letting out two mighty "burps" of high-energy particles, lending support to the theory that such galactic cores go through cycles of messy activity.Researchers presented images of the belching black hole today (Jan. 11) at the American Astronomical Society's winter meeting in National Harbor, Maryland, showing lingering evidence of two burps in a row."Black holes are voracious eaters, but it also turns out they don't have very good table manners," Julie Comerford, an astronomer at the University of Colorado Boulder, said during a news conference at the event today. "We know a lot of examples of black holes with single burps emanating out, but we discovered a galaxy with a supermassive black hole that has not one but two burps." [The Strangest Black Holes in the Universe]Supermassive black holes that lurk at the center of galaxies can have masses ranging from a million to a billion times that of the sun. Although they often lie relatively dormant, they can snap into action when gas comes near, sucking it inward and blasting out some high-energy particles in the process — the "burp." (Note that those particles come from near the black hole's event horizon, but not within its point of no return.)The supermassive black hole in question lies at the center of a galaxy called SDSS J1354+1327, about 800 million light-years from Earth, and it seems to be making meals of gas released by a companion galaxy. Comerford's team combined images from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope to pinpoint the black hole (in X-ray) and two emerging bubbles of gas shocked into motion by the fast-moving particles: one above, and one below. The older burp happened earlier, and the bubble has had time to expand 30,000 light-years from the black hole, Comerford said. The newer burp, by contrast, appears as just a little loop that's made it 3,000 light-years from the black hole."This new burp is actually moving like a shock wave — it's coming out very fast, and so it's kind of like a sonic boom of a burp," Comerford said, "whereas the gas to the south shows us an older burp that happens 100,000 years earlier before that newer burp."Theory held that supermassive black holes would go through a cycle of feasting, burping and then napping for a while, Comerford said, and spotting these belches helps set a pace for that process. While two burps 100,000 years apart may seem like a pretty slow metabolism, it's very fast on cosmic scales.The pace matched computer models of how those interactions would work, Comerford added. In the video below, for instance, from work by Jared Gabor and Frédéric Bournaud of CEA Saclay in France, you're watching a galaxy from the side as burps emerge above and below it.The black hole Comerford imaged is getting its fuel from a companion galaxy next door — the two are exchanging a stream of stars and gas after recently colliding.Closer to home, there's evidence that the black hole at the center of the Milky Way burped as well, at least once: In 2010, researchers found bubbles of gas expanding outward from the galactic core, from an event millions of years ago. The pace of such burps suggests that the Milky Way will indeed burp again someday."Right now, our galaxy's supermassive black hole is firmly in the nap phase of the feast-burp-nap cycle, but it's just waiting for its next meal to come along," Comerford said. "In the future, it will probably feast and burp once again."But that galactic burp is nothing to worry about, she told Space.com. "If our Milky Way's black hole became active again, we are far enough away from it that we would be fine," Comerford said. "If our solar system was very close to the black hole, though, we'd be fried."	podobne	2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009
2002	Astronomers have caught a massive black hole letting out a "double burp" after bingeing on hot gas.When cosmic gas comes near one of these sinkholes, it gets sucked in - but some of the energy is released back into space in the form of a burp.Now, the Hubble and Chandra space telescopes have detected a new belch emerging from a black hole located about 800 million light-years away.But they saw a remnant of another belch that occurred 100,000 years earlier.Black holes are voracious eaters, but it turns out they don't have very good table manners, Julie Comerford, from the University of Colorado, Boulder, told the 231st American Astronomical Society meeting in Washington DC.There are a lot of examples of black holes with single burps emanating out, but we discovered a galaxy with a supermassive black hole that has not one but two burps.The burp itself consists of a stream of high-energy particles that is kicked back from the black hole.Supermassive black holes are the largest type and are found at the centres of nearly all big galaxies. X-ray emission from the galaxy in question - called SDSS J1354+1327 - was picked up by the Chandra telescope, allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of its central black hole.Hubble was able to show them that a cloud of blue-green gas extending away from the black hole represented the aftermath of an earlier burp. They found that electrons had been stripped from atoms in the cone of gas and surmise that this was caused by a burst of radiation from the vicinity of the black hole.In the meantime, it had expanded 30,000 light-years away from the black hole itself.But the astronomers found a little loop in the images; the sign of a new belch emerging from the cosmic sinkhole."This new burp is actually moving like a shockwave that is coming out very fast," said Dr Comerford."I thought of an analogy for this and I was debating whether to use it or whether it's a little too gross... imagine someone eating dinner at their kitchen table and they're eating and burping, eating and burping.You walk in the room and you notice there's an old burp still hanging in the air from the appetiser course. Meanwhile, they're eating the main course and they let out a new burp that's rocking the kitchen table.She said the black hole was going through a cycle of feasting, burping and napping, before starting over.The observations are important because they support previous theories - not demonstrated until now - that black holes should go through these cycles. The black holes were expected to become very bright in the process of feasting and burping and then go dark during the nap phase.Theory predicted that black holes should flicker on and off very quickly and this galaxy's evidence of black holes does flicker on timescales of 100,000 years - which is long in human timescales, but in cosmological timescales is very fast, said Julie Comerford.The researchers think the black hole erupted twice because it consumed two separate meals. The reason for this might lie with the fact that the galaxy it's in had collided with another galaxy nearby. This would provide plenty of cosmic gas on which a black hole could feast.There's a stream of stars and gas connecting these two galaxies. That collision led gas to stream towards the supermassive black hole and feed it two separate meals that led to these two separate burps, said the University of Colorado researcher.The results are published in the Astrophysical Journal.	podobne	2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009
2003	A “SUPERMASSIVE” black hole let out “two burps” in a space binge that moved like a “shockwave” as gas was sucked inwards and released back into space, it has been revealed.The Hubble and Chandra space telescopes detected the burp 800million light-years away.Julie Comerford, from the University of Colorado, said: "Black holes are voracious eaters, but it turns out they don't have very good table manners."There are a lot of examples of black holes with single burps emanating out, but we discovered a galaxy with a supermassive black hole that has not one but two burps."Ms Comerford announced the discovery at the 231st American Astronomical Society meeting in Washington DC.The expert added that “black holes are voracious eaters, but it turns out they don't have very good table manners” as she compared the space behemoths to “someone eating dinner”.She went on: "This new burp is actually moving like a shockwave that is coming out very fast."I thought of an analogy for this and I was debating whether to use it or whether it's a little too gross... imagine someone eating dinner at their kitchen table and they're eating and burping, eating and burping."You walk in the room and you notice there's an old burp still hanging in the air from the appetiser course.“Meanwhile, they're eating the main course and they let out a new burp that's rocking the kitchen table."A space “burp” consists of high-energy particles being launched back into space from the depths of a black hole.Supermassive black holes are the largest form of the space giant and are typically found in the centre of big galaxies.An X-ray emission from the galaxy, dubbed SDSS J1354+1327, was discovered by the Chandra telescope.The Hubble telescope then picked up clouds of blue-green gas emerging from the black hole from a previous burp.Using Ms Comerford’s analogy, the black hole repeated a cycle of binging, burping and napping.The team of researchers, that published a journal entry on the results, declared they believe the black hole could have burped twice thanks to a collision between two galaxies.Ms Comerford stated: "There's a stream of stars and gas connecting these two galaxies. That collision led gas to stream towards the supermassive black hole and feed it two separate meals that led to these two separate burps.”The new discovery supports previous theories that suggested black holes go through cycles of burping.Ms Comerford explained: "Theory predicted that black holes should flicker on and off very quickly and this galaxy's evidence of black holes does flicker on timescales of 100,000 years - which is long in human timescales, but in cosmological timescales is very fast.”	podobne	2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009
2004	We’ve all felt the pressure that builds up in our stomach after a can of carbonated cola or a particularly filling meal, and no matter how polite of a person you are, you no doubt let a nice healthy burp fly every now and then. As it turns out, black holes have a similar habit, and astronomers have just captured photo evidence of one of the universe’s most destructive entities burping not once, but twice in quick succession.Scientists using some of mankind’s most powerful space observation tools — the Hubble and Chandra space telescopes — have observed the black hole at the center of a far-off galaxy spewing hot gas in two separate events. The galaxy, called SDSS J1354+1327 (catchy name, huh?) is some 800 million light-years from Earth, but that’s still close enough for astronomers to detect its foul behavior.The observations were presented this week at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society, where astronomer Julie Comerford explained what the team was able to see.“Black holes are voracious eaters, but it also turns out they don’t have very good table manners,” Comerford said. “We know a lot of examples of black holes with single burps emanating out, but we discovered a galaxy with a supermassive black hole that has not one but two burps.”The “burps” appear as colorful explosions of gas emitting from the center of the galaxy. In the clearest photo of the event, the beginning of a massive burp is seen shooting out of the upper left of the black hole, while the remnants of an older burp can be spotted still dissipating below it. While these two events are thought to have happened some 100,000 years apart, that’s actually an incredibly short period of time when we’re talking about black hole activity.Researchers believe the black hole is behaving this way because it is consuming a huge amount of nearby matter. The hole’s gaping maw is sucking up massive amounts of material, burping some of it out in a huge shockwave-like event, and then resting for a brief period before resuming its feast. You know, kind of like your uncle at Thanksgiving.	podobne	2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009
2005	A giant black hole located at the center of a galaxy 800 million light-years from Earth has been caught on camera letting out not one, but two massive "burps" of highly charged particles.It is the first time astronomers have viewed the phenomenon twice in the same black hole.Images released Thursday and credited to the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory were presented at the American Astronomical Society's winter meeting in National Harbor, Md., outside Washington, D.C."Black holes are voracious eaters, but it also turns out they don't have very good table manners," Julie Comerford, an astronomer at the University of Colorado Boulder, said during a news conference Thursday, according to Space.com. "We know a lot of examples of black holes with single burps emanating out, but we discovered a galaxy with a supermassive black hole that has not one, but two burps."The supermassive black hole is at the center of a galaxy known as SDSS J1354+1327, or colloquially as simply J1354. Astronomers have found evidence of such black holes at the heart of most large galaxies, including our own Milky Way."The two-course meal for the black hole comes from a companion galaxy that collided with J1354 in the past. This collision produced a stream of stars and gas that links J1354 and the other galaxy. The separate outbursts from the black hole are caused by different clumps from this stream being consumed by the supermassive black hole," NASA writes."The optical data indicate that, in the past, the supermassive black hole appears to have consumed, or accreted, large amounts of gas while blasting off an outflow of high-energy particles.

2006	Astronomers have caught a supermassive black hole in a distant galaxy snacking on gas and then "burping" -- not once, but twice.The galaxy under study, called SDSS J1354+1327 (J1354 for short), is about 800 million light-years from Earth. The team used observations from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, as well as the W.M. Keck Observatory in Mauna Kea, Hawaii, and the Apache Point Observatory (APO) near Sunspot, New Mexico.Chandra detected a bright, point-like source of X-ray emission from J1354, a telltale sign of the presence of a supermassive black hole millions or billions of times more massive than our Sun. The X-rays are produced by gas heated to millions of degrees by the enormous gravitational and magnetic forces near the black hole. Some of this gas will fall into the black hole, while a portion will be expelled in a powerful outflow of high-energy particles.By comparing X-ray images from Chandra and visible-light (optical) images from Hubble, the team determined that the black hole is located in the center of the galaxy, the expected address for such an object. The X-ray data also provide evidence that the supermassive black hole is embedded in a heavy veil of dust and gas.The results indicate that in the past, the supermassive black hole in J1354 appears to have consumed, or accreted, large amounts of gas while blasting off an outflow of high-energy particles. The outflow eventually switched off then turned back on about 100,000 years later. This is strong evidence that accreting black holes can switch their power output off and on again over timescales that are short compared to the 13.8-billion-year age of the universe."We are seeing this object feast, burp, and nap, and then feast and burp once again, which theory had predicted," said Julie Comerford of the University of Colorado (CU) at Boulder's Department of Astrophysical and Space Science, who led the study. "Fortunately, we happened to observe this galaxy at a time when we could clearly see evidence for both events."So why did the black hole have two separate meals? The answer lies in a companion galaxy that is linked to J1354 by streams of stars and gas produced by a collision between the two galaxies. The team concluded that clumps of material from the companion galaxy swirled toward the center of J1354 and then were eaten by the supermassive black hole.The team used optical data from Hubble, Keck, and APO to show that electrons had been stripped from atoms in a cone of gas extending some 30,000 light-years south from the galaxy's center. This stripping was likely caused by a burst of radiation from the vicinity of the black hole, indicating that a feasting event had occurred. To the north they found evidence for a shock wave, similar to a sonic boom, located about 3,000 light-years from the black hole. This suggests that a burp occurred after a different clump of gas had been consumed roughly 100,000 years later."This galaxy really caught us off guard," said CU Boulder doctoral student Rebecca Nevin, a study co-author who used data from APO to look at the velocities and intensities of light from the gas and stars in J1354. "We were able to show that the gas from the northern part of the galaxy was consistent with an advancing edge of a shock wave, and the gas from the south was consistent with an older outflow from the black hole."Our Milky Way galaxy's supermassive black hole has had at least one burp. In 2010, another research team discovered a Milky Way belch using observations from the orbiting Fermi Gamma-ray Observatory to look at the galaxy edge on. Astronomers saw gas outflows dubbed "Fermi bubbles" that shine in the gamma-ray, X-ray, and radio wave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.These are the kinds of bubbles we see after a black hole feeding event, said CU postdoctoral fellow Scott Barrows. "Our galaxy's supermassive black hole is now napping after a big meal, just like J1354's black hole has in the past. So we also expect our massive black hole to feast again, just as J1354's has."Other co-authors on the new study include postdoctoral fellow Francisco Muller-Sanchez of CU Boulder, Jenny Greene of Princeton University, David Pooley from Trinity University, Daniel Stern from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and Fiona Harrison from the California Institute of Technology.	podobne	2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009
2007	Black holes are notoriously messy eaters, blasting the scraps of shredded stars as enormous belches of gas and dust. Now, for the first time, astronomers spotted the same black hole letting out two hearty burps.“Black holes are voracious eaters, but it also turns out they don’t have very good table manners,” astronomer Julia M. Comerford said during a news conference at the American Astronomical Society’s winter meeting, Sarah Lewin reports for Space.com. “We know a lot of examples of black holes with single burps emanating out, but we discovered a galaxy with a supermassive black hole that has not one but two burps.”It’s not uncommon for astronomers to observe the aftermath of a black hole guzzling down a star—while most of the material is lost behind its event horizon (what Lewin aptly calls the “point of no return”), traces of its meal are burped out in high-energy jets of particles that are blasted into space. Astronomers have long theorized that supermassive black holes—the black holes millions to billions times the mass of the sun that lurk in the center of galaxies—go through periods of activity and quiescence, a cycle of feeding and naps over enormous timescales.Now, a team of researchers led by Comerford have witnessed the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy about 800 million light-years from Earth emitting these jets twice, the scientists write in an article for The Astrophysical Journal. The Hubble Space Telescope imaged the black hole in visible light and the Chandra X-ray Observatory scanned it using X-rays. The space telescopes captured two gas bubbles shocked by jets of fast-moving particles.One was a cloud of blue-green gas. It was ionized, meaning its electrons were stripped from its atoms, Paul Rincon reports for BBC, which suggests that the cloud was blasted by radiation from the black hole. Researchers measured the cloud lingering some 30,000 light-years from the black hole, and during its lengthy time of traveling the “burp” had plenty of time to expand.The younger burp, however, is a small loop that’s only 3,000 light-years from the black hole, Lewis writes. The two clouds were the result of two different feeding episodes for the black hole with a 100,000 year resting period in between. The long period between events matches computer models of how black holes feed, Lewis reports.“Imagine someone eating dinner at their kitchen table and they’re eating and burping, eating and burping,” Comerford​ tells Ricon. “You walk in the room and you notice there’s an old burp still hanging in the air from the appetizer course. Meanwhile, they’re eating the main course and they let out a new burp that’s rocking the kitchen table.”The same situation could be happening with Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole in the center of our home Milky Way galaxy. “Right now, our galaxy’s supermassive black hole is firmly in the nap phase of the feast-burp-nap cycle, but it’s just waiting for its next meal to come along,” Comerford tells Lewis. “In the future, it will probably feast and burp once again.”While high-energy jets emerging from black holes can be dangerous to anything nearby, the solar system is sufficiently on the outskirts of the Milky Way, so we won’t be at risk if Sagittarius A* awakens for a snack.	podobne	2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009
2008	Last week, scientists presented an image of a supermassive black hole burping—twice. The behemoth had guzzled on gas before belching out a cloud of high-energy particles and settling in for a few thousand years’ nap. Then it woke up and did the whole thing again. Eat, sleep, repeat.But why do black holes burp, and what can this tell scientists?High-Energy Particles Intense gravitational and magnetic forces surround black holes. These can pull in large amounts of matter, creating a veil of dust and gas. As the greedy black hole feasts on this nearby gas, some is expelled in a powerful kind of burp. Each "burp" is really an outflow of high-energy particles, which astronomers can observe using X-ray images.Scientists have seen black holes burp like this before. What’s special about this new image is the fact it reveals two belches. About 100,000 years after the first burp, the black hole, which sits in the J1354 galaxy 800 million light years away, spewed out a second.This confirms that black holes can turn their power output on and off in a relatively short space of time. Although 100,000 years might seem long, in cosmological terms it is minute, given that the universe itself began 13.8 billion years ago."We are seeing this object feast, burp, and nap, and then feast and burp once again, which theory had predicted," said Julie Comerford of the University of Colorado, who led the study, in a statement.The information has big implications for physics. Repeated burps had been predicted, but this is the first time more than one has been observed from the same black hole.By analyzing the area around the black hole, the scientists were also able to narrow in on the cause of this second belch. The researchers believe that a nearby galaxy collision sent clumps of gas swirling toward the black hole. Just like its first meal, the black hole ate, belched and then napped.The research suggests the supermassive black hole in our own galaxy could also burp repeatedly. It has belched at least once before and is currently lying in wait of another big feast.University of Colorado postdoctoral fellow Scott Barrows says: "Our galaxy's supermassive black hole is now napping after a big meal, just like J1354’s black hole has in the past. So we also expect our massive black hole to feast again, just as J1354's has."	podobne	2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009
2009	A rare supermassive black hole has been seen unleashing a huge ‘double burp’ after feasting on stars, gas and planets from a nearby galaxy.Astronomers spotted the gluttonous black hole's belches after studying a galaxy called SDSS J1354+1327, about 800 million light-years from Earth.Researchers in Colorado noticed that it let off jets of bright light from the gas it consumed twice over the course of 100,000 years.These 'burps' were followed by a period of rest, which researchers describe as the black hole 'taking a nap.'Scientists believe supermassive black holes such as this go through a cycle of feasting, burping and then napping - and the latest discovery confirms this theory. 'Black holes are voracious eaters, but it also turns out they don't have very good table manners,' study coauthor and University of Colorado scientist Dr Julie Comerford told the 231st American Astronomical Society meeting in Washington, DC, yesterday. 'We know a lot of examples of black holes with single burps emanating out, but we discovered a galaxy with a supermassive black hole that has not one but two burps.Supermassive black holes have masses greater than one million suns combined and would fit inside a ball with a diameter about the size of the solar system. In the same way as normal black holes, they are regions of space-time with gravitational effects so strong that even  light cannot escape from inside of them.The gas they pick up produced electromagnetic radiation as it becomes increasingly dense and is pulled towards the event horizon.This energy is released in quasars that are seen visible light and X-ray wavelengths.X-rays from the distant galaxy were detected by the Chandra telescope and later, the Hubble Space Telescope.They provided astronomers at Nasa with images that showed clouds of electrons that had been removed from atoms by a high-energy burst of radiation.The team said the cloud of ejected gas had already spread 30,000 light years from the black hole.	podobne	2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009
3001	A powerful storm with extreme winds blew in from the North Sea this week. It slammed into the Netherlands, tearing off roofs, toppling trees and prompting flight cancellations and havoc at the airports. The storm flipped trucks and rail service was suspended. Then it moved on to Germany, where authorities declared it the worst storm since 2007.In an unprecedented move, all five storm surge gates were closed in the Netherlands by the country’s infrastructure agency. These massive movable barriers prevent water from the North Sea from surging up rivers and inundating vulnerable areas. Much of the Netherlands lies below sea level. The gates were built in response to a flood that killed almost 2,000 people in 1953.The closure of the gates disrupted shipping traffic in and out of Rotterdam, the busiest port in Europe. Gale-force winds tipped stacks of empty shipping containers like they were toys.Gusts of nearly 90 mph caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights at Amsterdam’s bustling Schiphol airport, according to the Associated Press. The high-speed train Thalys, which connects Amsterdam to Paris, was temporarily suspended because of downed electrical wires and debris on the tracks.Ferry service across the Netherlands was halted. People wanting to get from Texel in the Frisian Islands, to the mainland, were forced to wait out the wind and massive waves.Several people were killed by falling trees. A 62-year-old man died in the town of Olst when he was hit in the face with a large branch after he got out of his vehicle to clear debris from the road. A second death occurred when a tree killed the driver of a car in Enschede, near the German border. Terrifying videos posted online show people being blown through plazas like tumbleweeds and bikes being ripped from cyclists’ hands.In Belgium, a code orange, the second-highest storm warning, was in effect Thursday. The port of Ghent was closed and tram traffic in the capital of Brussels was suspended. Several public parks were closed because of fears of falling trees.It was the worst storm to hit Germany in just over a decade. There were widespread disruptions to all forms of travel. Dozens of flights were canceled in Düsseldorf and all long-distance train service across the country was suspended.The storm produced the strongest winds in the mountains and was accompanied with heavy snow. In the Bavarian Alps, a World Cup ski event was suspended as winds howled up to 126 mph on the peaks.Authorities in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany say it will be several days before things get back to normal.	podobne	3001,3002,3003,3004,3005,3006,3007,3008,3009

Police are investigating the cause, including whether the storm was to blame.Meanwhile in Belgium, a driver was killed when a tree collapsed on to her car south of Brussels early on Thursday morning, and several other people were injured by flying debris in the rest of the country as the storm picked up in intensity during the day.Schiphol tweeted shortly after 11am local time that it was halting all take-offs and landings “until further notice” because of the severe weather conditions.Flag carrier KLM had already cancelled more than 200 flights before the storm.National broadcaster NOS reported that the main railway station in The Hague was closed because of fears that parts of its new glass roof would be blown off by Thursday’s storm.Traffic on Dutch roads was plunged into chaos, with the wind blowing over trucks and toppling trees and hampering efforts to clean up the mess. In Amsterdam, authorities halted all trams.The national weather service said it recorded wind gusts of up to 140 km/h in the southern port of Hook of Holland as the storm passed over the Dutch coast.Water authorities in the low-lying Netherlands also were closely monitoring the storm and preparing to close locks and storm barriers if necessary because of high-water levels.Numerous incidentsBefore halting all trains, the Dutch rail service reported numerous incidents including a collision between a train and a trampoline. The service had no further details of the collision.In Amsterdam, a man had a narrow escape when a tree was blown over onto his scooter. He escaped unhurt.Neighbouring Belgium also was being lashed by the storm with the port of Ghent closed because of the high winds.Belgium set off its code orange alert – the second highest storm warning – for the north of the country early Thursday and tram traffic had to be halted in parts of the capital Brussels, where several public parks had to be closed.In Germany, some 100,000 people in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and in the northern state of Lower Saxony were left without power, a spokesman for the energy company Westnetz said. He said the company hoped to restore power within hours, provided the storm did not cause further damage.In Munich, eight domestic flights by Lufthansa were cancelled, the airport operator said.	podobne	3001,3002,3003,3004,3005,3006,3007,3008,3009

She is responsible for player transactions and has a wider brief, including overseeing the academy and scouting structure, following the departure of Michael Emenalo last November.Has Emenalo's departure affected the club this month?He never had sole control over new transfers, the structure did not allow for it. He worked alongside Granovskaia, a trusted advisor to owner Roman Abramovich, who became involved in Chelsea transfer activity just under a decade ago. Chelsea have yet to replace Emenalo, like for like, and may well be considering another model.Who has the final say on buying new players?The transfer sign-off is Conte to Granovskaia to Abramovich. A final financial decision lies with the owner, with Granovskaia in charge of negotiations. Abramovich's involvement is generally to consider the plan and targets and give them the green light. It is his money, after all, and it is safe to say he has more knowledge of deals being done in each window than some other Premier League club owners. But we are told he does not personally get involved in the specifics of deals or negotiations.So Granovskaia is the most powerful figure at Stamford Bridge, aside from Abramovich?On transfers, yes, in terms of finalising new deals. She is one of a three-person club board, which also includes Bruce Buck and Eugene Tenenbaum. Generally speaking they would not be involved on individual transfers. But that is not to say the board are never involved.Does the structure work?The system ensures a manager does not have complete control over everything behind the scenes. Chelsea will point to the fact that, since 2009, they have won the Premier League and FA Cup three times, the Champions League, Europa League and EFL Cup.	zblizone	4001,4002,4003,4004,4005,4006,4007,4008,4009
4002	Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte says his strikers must be more clinical in attack and admits "the finishing could be better".After a strong start to his Chelsea career, club-record signing Alvaro Morata has missed a number of chances in recent weeks and was sent off in their midweek FA Cup win over Norwich.Chelsea are in the market to sign a target man to bolster their attacking options to ease the burden on Morata, and Conte says his forwards need to take their opportunities."I think in every game we have created many chances to score," said Conte."At the same time, we must be honest and to tell that maybe our finishing could be better in our quality. In our quality, the finishing could be better, and to score me."Every striker has their own characteristics and I'm happy to work with my players."[Morata] must learn to control himself. The second yellow card was for dissent and I agree with the player for the first yellow card, but I don't agree with the player for the second yellow card.For sure, he needs to check better himself in the future.Chelsea have scored just one goal in their last four games in all competitions and several strikers have been linked with a move to the club this month.Sky Sports News reported earlier this week that Chelsea had approached the West Ham about a move for Andy Carroll, although any potential deal has been scuppered by an ankle injury to the 29-year-old.Stoke's Peter Crouch was linked with a move to Stamford Bridge this week, although Sky Sports News understands Chelsea will not be signing the 36-year-old this month, while Sky in Italy say Roma and former Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko is interesting the Premier League champions.Morata has just two goals in his last 11 games while Michy Batshuayi is understood to be a target for several clubs this month, but Conte took his regular stance of deferring transfer speculation to the club's hierarchy.I think I was very clear in the past to tell you that the club sometimes asks me my opinion about our transfer market, about our situation and the way that we can improve, he said."But at the same time, I said in the past that the final decision is for the club."This is our situation, this is the truth and I think the club has to spend money."In this case, it's right to spend money in the way they prefer."When asked whether he feels confident Chelsea can bring in the players they want, the Italian said he feels "calm" at the current situation."Confident is a big word," he said."We have to wait. I gave my opinion to my club, but the final decision is for the club."I have to wait and to see during this transfer market, but I am very calm on this aspect, also because I'm working with these players in the right way and I'm very happy with the commitment of my players"Conte also revealed new signing Ross Barkley is in the squad for Saturday's trip to Brighton.	zblizone	4001,4002,4003,4004,4005,4006,4007,4008,4009
4003	Antonio Conte has admitted he has been disappointed with Alvaro Morata’s finishing, as well as the Chelsea striker’s discipline in recent weeks. The Chelsea manager was furious to see his forward needlessly sent off against Norwich in the FA Cup on Wednesday after Morata reacted poorly to being booked for diving. The second yellow was for dissent and meant Chelsea finished the FA Cup clash with nine men and were without both Morata and Pedro for the crucial penalty shoot-out.Conte hit out at Morata after that game, despite Chelsea edging the shoot-out, and again admitted on Friday the striker needed to sort out his ‘stupid’ discipline issues. ‘For sure in Norwich game he knows very well his mistake,’ Conte said ahead of Chelsea’ game against Brighton on Sunday. ‘There was frustration for the first yellow card because he didn’t deserve it. It’s not right to book him.‘You must learn to control yourself because the second yellow card was for dissent. ‘I agree with the player for the first yellow card but can’t with the second. ‘For the striker in this situation it can happen. Alvaro this is the first season that’s he’s having a full season, maybe for him this is the first time to face these type of problems.‘He has to overcome this problem because it is a stupid problem. The most important thing is to work for the team and not lose confidence.’ Morata has been the subject of intense criticism from Chelsea fans this month after missing golden opportunistic in tight games. The Spaniard has drawn a blank in his last three Premier League games and has scored just three goals in his last ten league appearances.Morata missed golden opportunities in two recent games with Arsenal, as well as against Norwich on Wednesday, and Conte hinted his striker was letting him down considering the amount of chances Chelsea were creating for him. ‘Its very difficult to have a god response to this question,’ he said. ‘In every game we created many changes to sore, this is the most important thing for us. ‘We must be honest to say our finishing could be better in our quality. The finishing could be better to score more.’	zblizone	4001,4002,4003,4004,4005,4006,4007,4008,4009
4004	Chelsea have made contact with Stoke about signing veteran striker Peter Crouch but no deal is imminent, BBC Sport understands.Blues boss Antonio Conte wants to bring in a striker, which would allow Michy Batshuayi to leave the club this month.West Ham's Andy Carroll was an option but that avenue has been closed by the ankle injury that will keep him out for at least a month and possibly longer.Former Liverpool striker Crouch, 36, is contracted to Stoke until summer 2019.As a short-term measure, Crouch is attractive to the Premier League champions because he is used to the league, having made 449 appearances, would understand his role as back-up to main striker Alvaro Morata, and is available for the Champions League. He has scored 18 times in European football's top competition.One drawback is that the former England man has played in both domestic cup competitions for Stoke and is therefore unavailable for the remainder of those competitions.'It's a no-brainer'Analysis from former England and Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas on 5 live It is a weird one, I am not going to lie. What is going through Conte's head is the need for a clear plan B - to go long and cause problems. In terms of that it is a good option. I played with him for years and for a midfielder he is an absolute dream.It looks like it will be a year-and-a-half deal. It is a no-brainer in terms of wages and what he brings to the table. Why not?Crouch is as professional as they come - he will be great to have around the dressing room. He will not be overawed because he has been at some big clubs. It is a great opportunity for him and I think the fans will take to him.	zblizone	4001,4002,4003,4004,4005,4006,4007,4008,4009
4005	Ross Barkley says he is "obsessed" with improving and has ambitions to become a "world-class" player, as he prepares to make his Chelsea debut.The 24-year-old left boyhood club Everton to join the Premier League champions earlier this month, but has not yet featured as he has been recovering from injury.However, he is in the squad to face Brighton on Saturday, live on Sky Sports Premier League, and speaking to Sky Sports, he explained how determined he is to develop at Chelsea."I am obsessed with improving. I want to get to a level where I am regarded as one of the best and coming to a club like Chelsea gives me the right platform to improve," Barkley said."I want to be regarded as a world-class midfielder. At the moment I have a lot of potential and a lot of world-class attributes and I want to showcase that at a massive club like Chelsea and win things and be regarded as a top-quality player."I have got to a level where I feel I needed to make the jump to Chelsea and push myself and get myself to a better level and playing with world-class players here is only going to help."I am ready to hit the ground running. The first half of the season dragged for me, I just wanted to kick a ball, but I am back fit and I am ready to go."Barkley has not played a competitive match since May 2017, but did get some minutes under his belt in a behind-closed-doors friendly against QPR this week, playing 75 minutes and scoring a goal and providing an assist."It was a good runout," he said. "I have settled in really well with all the lads. It was my first game for a while since I have been out injured and it felt good to get back out onto the pitch."I have had four full weeks of training now so I am feeling really fit. I feel really good and am ready to go."With Alvaro Morata and Pedro both suspended for the clash with Brighton, Barkley could go straight into Antonio Conte's starting line-up alongside Eden Hazard.He described Hazard as an "unbelievable player", and added: "You can't put many players up there with Hazard, he is unbelievable, he is up there with the best in the world, I have been training here for a couple of weeks and you can see how sharp he is."I am not the same type of player but if I could get anywhere near his level now I would be made up."	zblizone	4001,4002,4003,4004,4005,4006,4007,4008,4009
4005	JAMIE VARDY has dropped a cheeky hint he may be interested in a move to Chelsea.Leicester star Vardy has been a target for the Blues in the past after he helped fire the club to the Premier League title.And with Chelsea appearing to be desperate to bring in a new striker during the transfer window the club have been linked with several players.Now Vardy has added fuel to speculation he could be one of the forwards the London club are looking at with a mischievous action on social media.The 31-year-old was responding to messages from his fans on Instagram when he "liked" a message asking him to move to Chelsea.Such a deal would see him link up with former Leicester league-winning team-mates Danny Drinkwater and N'Golo Kante.But whether that is any indication he is about to swap the King Power Stadium for Stamford Bridge remains open to question.Earlier this month Chelsea boss Antonio Conte was asked what he thought of Vardy, and he admitted he was a player he rated but was unlikely to sign.But since then Conte has admitted he is not always aware of the transfer business the club is planning.And with attackers in short supply in the squad, the club have been linked with a string of forwards this month.	zblizone	4001,4002,4003,4004,4005,4006,4007,4008,4009
4006	Chelsea will hold more talks with Roma over a potential double deal for Emerson Palmieri and Edin Dzeko next week.Left-back Palmieri is hoping to complete a move to Stamford Bridge to compete with Marcos Alonso, despite the fact Chelsea would ideally like to take the Brazilian on loan.Roma want £22 million for Palmieri, but there is optimism on all sides that a deal for either a loan or permanent transfer can be agreed.Chelsea’s interest in Dzeko is less advanced and has come about as the club attempt to find a target man to help out Alvaro Morata, who is suspended for Saturday’s trip to Brighton.Morata’s suspension means Michy Batshuayi, who could move in the opposite direction to Dzeko, will start against Brighton. And Roma face Inter Milan on Sunday, which means discussions have been put on hold during the weekend.The Premier League champions had been hopeful of signing Andy Carroll, but the West Ham United centre-forward's ankle injury has forced them to look elsewhere. There is an outside chance of Chelsea reigniting their interest if the 29-year-old can recover by the end of the month.Dzeko would not be eligible to play in the Champions League, but he could play for Chelsea in the Premier League and all of the cup competitions.Having made an inquiry over his potential availability, Chelsea will hold more talks over Dzeko next week, but they also continue to explore other options.Crystal Palace have already warned Chelsea that they do not want to loan out Christian Benteke, although that may change if Roy Hodgson can sign a striker, while a move for Stoke City’s Peter Crouch has not been discounted.Antonio Conte’s interest in Dzeko was confirmed by the former Manchester City forward’s agent, Irfan Redzepagic, who told Italian media: “All I can say is that Conte likes Dzeko. But then who doesn’t like Edin?“Have I spoken to Conte or Chelsea? My role means I can’t reveal certain transfer market dynamics. I understand the question, but I have a very specific role.“Look, every time we talk about Dzeko the names of clubs like Chelsea, Chinese clubs, Mexican clubs come up. These are just rumours. The truth is that Dzeko wants to stay at Roma.”	zblizone	4001,4002,4003,4004,4005,4006,4007,4008,4009
4007	Chelsea have been accused, after an initial Fifa investigation, of breaking the rules on the signing of 25 foreign players under the age of 18. The number of cases could rise, with the matter now in the hands of the governing body’s disciplinary committee, which has the power to impose sanctions – chief among them a ban on transfers.Fifa announced last September that it was looking into alleged breaches at Chelsea when it came to the recruitment of youth players from overseas – making them the first English club to face such action.Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid were investigated for infringements related to the signing of minors and each was given a two-window transfer ban, although Real served only one after a successful appeal to the court of arbitration for sport (Cas).The initial investigation into Chelsea was carried out by the compliance unit of Fifa’s transfer matching system (TMS) and it is believed it was first alerted by the case of Bertrand Traoré, the Burkina Faso forward. He was signed to professional terms by Chelsea on 1 January 2014, the day the transfer window opened after his 18th birthday, but pictures would emerge of him playing for the club against Arsenal in a “non-competitive” game on 23 October 2011, when he was 16. The pictures came to Fifa’s attention in January 2016.Clubs are not permitted to sign players under the age of 18 from other countries unless their parents have emigrated for reasons not connected to football or both the player and club are based within 50km of a national border. Under Fifa’s Article 19, the only other exception is for transfers within either the European Union or European Economic Area where the player is aged between 16 and 18. Fifa was concerned that Traoré, who left Chelsea for Lyon last June, did not appear to fulfil any of the exemptions.TMS flagged a total of 25 player cases in which it thought Chelsea might have transgressed and it passed its findings to the disciplinary committee, which is searching for further examples in a forensic look at the club’s academy. It is within its remit to discard any of the original 25 cases. The disciplinary committee can examine any incoming transfer over a period of 10 years.It has requested information from Chelsea and is in contact with the Football Association. It wants the FA to provide facts and figures for the 25 players – and possibly others – such as the registration details and the matches in which they have played. The disciplinary committee’s investigation is at an early stage but it is expected to develop quickly over the coming months.When it has been completed it will submit its evidence to an independent panel within the disciplinary committee, who will reach a verdict. If found guilty, Chelsea would be entitled to appeal to Fifa and then to Cas.A Chelsea spokesman said: “Chelsea FC complies with all Fifa statutes and regulations when recruiting players.”Fifa deems there to be different levels of infringement on the regulations regarding minors, with the most serious being a breach of Article 19. Behind that there are less serious ones, some administrative, such as the failure to request authorisation through the correct channels.Fifa’s principle, which it has established, is that – irrespective of the number of minors involved – a systemic breach of the rules is so serious it should entail a transfer embargo. The amount of cases affects the severity of the sanction but, if a club has a low number, Fifa believes it should not mean it avoids a ban. It is also understood that Fifa worries that a one-window suspension does not create harmful consequences; it can be worked around with sufficient planning.Chelsea have argued that they had an option agreement, registered with and approved by the FA and Premier League, to secure Traoré’s registration after he turned 18 and which allowed them to play him in what were in effect considered trial games. In 2010 the club reached a settlement with Lens, which was ratified with Cas, to avoid a two-window transfer embargo that stemmed from the signing of Gaël Kakuta.Fifa says it does not comment on ongoing investigations nor can it confirm whether an investigation is ongoing.The Barcelona investigation was triggered by a newspaper article about the club’s signing of Lee Seung-woo – “the South Korean Messi” – aged 13. An employee at Fifa TMS read it and thought the deal might be in breach of the regulations. TMS would uncover 31 cases of potential transgressions and the independent panel would find Barcelona guilty on all 31. The club’s appeals failed and they were banned from two windows in 2015. Lee is now at Verona in Serie A.Real’s case started at Fifa TMS in October 2013 and in January 2016 they were found guilty of violating the rules on the registration of 39 minors. They had been investigated on 70. Cas would uphold 37 of the guilty verdicts but reduced the ban to one window – January 2017 – because the infringements were deemed to be less serious than those of Barcelona.Atlético’s numbers were the most startling in Spain, partly because of a partnership with Dalian Wanda Group, the Chinese property company. It saw many Chinese players coming to train at their academy. Fifa considered 183 cases in its final judgment; 153 would be confirmed. Atlético served their ban across both windows of last year.	zblizone	4001,4002,4003,4004,4005,4006,4007,4008,4009

5001	In June 2017, Google researchers discovered major security vulnerabilities in common computer processors, which were disclosed to the public earlier this month. And you should pay attention — because those vulnerabilities affect the computer processors that are in almost everything.  “This is actually a flaw in the way chips have been designed for more than the last decade,” Axios chief technology correspondent Ina Fried said on the latest episode of Too Embarrassed to Ask. “Basically, it is really all chips — the chips in your phones, the chips in your PCs, the chips potentially in other things.”  The flaws, known as Spectre and Meltdown, take advantage of how modern chips do calculations in advance for things they might need to do in the future. Fried explained that this makes certain tasks faster for some users, but opens the door for hackers to steal data that would normally be locked away if that user is running a malicious script.  “If you think of this as a bank, right now it’s easy to go back and forth between the lobby of bank and the high-security vault,” she said. “To close that, [companies are] making it really hard to get between those two things.”  “You had these chips that were incredibly powerful, and they had extra brain cycles and people were like, ‘What do we do with these extra brain cycles?’” Fried added. “What surprises me isn’t that they went to that, it’s that they didn’t foresee [that] unlocking the bank vault could cause problems. Nobody in the industry seemed to have seen it.”  You can listen to the new podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Overcast or wherever you listen to podcasts.  On the new podcast, Fried said the advice for consumers is easy: Patch your devices to the latest updates. But unfortunately, not everyone with a smartphone may have that option yet.  “I think what we’re going to see over time is, if there are exploits, Android is more vulnerable because people don’t fix their Android systems,” Fried said. “Even though Google has put out a patch, that’s not the same as the phone maker. Samsung might not have put out a patch. [And] the different chipmakers — it’s just a more crowded atmosphere.”  “Apple has said a little less,” she added. “They’ve said, ‘We’ve updated iOS and Mac OS.’ As is typical, they don’t go into a ton of detail about how vulnerable they were. They do have the advantage, though, that they can see the software, the chips and the hardware, and they can be more elegant in the way they fix it, because they control all those things.”	zblizone	5001,5002,5003,5004,5005,5006,5007
5002	 Intel says the unexpected reboots triggered by patching older chips affected by Meltdown and Spectre are happening to its newer chips, too.  Intel confirmed in an update late Wednesday that not only are its older Broadwell and Haswell chips tripping up on the firmware patches, but newer CPUs through to the latest Kaby Lake chips are too.  The firmware updates do protect Intel chips against potential Spectre attacks, but machines with Ivy Bridge, Sandy Bridge, Skylake, and Kaby Lake architecture processors are rebooting more frequently once the firmware has been updated, Intel said.  Intel has also updated its original Meltdown-Spectre advisory with a new warning about the stability issues and recommends OEMs and cloud providers test its beta silicon microcode updates before final release. These beta releases, which mitigate the Spectre Variant 2 CVE-2017-5715 attack on CPU speculative execution, will be available next week.  "Intel recommends that these partners, at their discretion, continue development and release of updates with existing microcode to provide protection against these exploits, understanding that the current versions may introduce issues such as reboot in some configurations," the company wrote.  "We further recommend that OEMs, Cloud service providers, system manufacturers and software vendors begin evaluation of Intel beta microcode update releases in anticipation of definitive root cause and subsequent production releases suitable for end users".	zblizone	5001,5002,5003,5004,5005,5006,5007
5003	Vendors of industrial systems have joined the long list of vendors  responding responses to the Meltdown and Spectre processor  vulnerabilities.                 So far, a dozen vendors have told ICS-CERT they use vulnerable processors, and The Register imagines there will be plenty more to come.                 Gold stars go to just two vendors: Smiths Medical, which has determined that none of its products are vulnerable; and OSISoft, whose PI System is vulnerable, and whose advisory includes anticipated performance impacts.                 Emerson Process and General Electric treat their  responses as customer information only, and keep them hidden behind a  regwall. So does Rockwell, for what it's worth, but the latter company  at least spoke to The Register about the impact on its systems).                 Another seven vendors in the market said they are  “investigating” the impact – ABB, Abbott, Johnson & Johnson (added  points for giving the advisory a 2017 timestamp), Philips, Schneider Electric, and Siemens.                 As readers know, the bugs arose out of how processors  implement speculative execution. Patches are a giant headache for  vendors and users alike, causing both performance and stability issues.	zblizone	5001,5002,5003,5004,5005,5006,5007
5004	Q. Is it safe to install the Windows patch for these new Spectre and Meltdown bugs? Do they affect Linux? (And who names these security flaws, anyway?)A. Meltdown and Spectre, the two recently announced security flaws  that can expose personal data to hackers, could potentially affect  Linux systems, along with computers and devices running Windows, Mac and  other operating-system software. These new bugs are actually in the computer’s hardware — specifically, in the central processing unit.  Check Microsoft’s support site for the absolute latest news, but the company previously warned that its updates for Windows 7 and Windows 10 can conflict with certain antivirus programs; users should contact those software makers about updates. Early reports that the Windows patches were causing severe problems on computers with AMD processors prompted Microsoft to temporarily halt updates to many of those systems for a few days. The software fixes are expected to make the computer run more slowly, but Microsoft has noted that newer processors running Windows 10 should feel the least impact.                                                                                Microsoft released its KB4056892 Windows security update for the Meltdown and Spectre flaws on Jan. 3.                                                   The New York Times                           The  Meltdown vulnerability exists in laptops, desktops and cloud-based  computers running most types of Intel processors made since 1995. The  Spectre flaw can affect those same systems as well, but also  smartphones, tablets and other gadgets running on processors made by  other companies, including AMD and ARM.To find out details for your particular system, Graz University of Technology’s “Meltdown and Spectre” site at https://meltdownattack.com  has an extensive collection of links to information about patches from  most major hardware and software makers, including several Linux  companies. Intel also has a page on its site with links and information about updates.As  for the origin of the names assigned to these bugs, the “Meltdown and  Spectre” site has an explanation. Meltdown gets is name because it  “basically melts security boundaries which are normally enforced by the  hardware.” Spectre’s moniker is “based on the root cause, speculative  execution,” and as the researchers note, “As it is not easy to fix, it  will haunt us for quite some time.”	zblizone	5001,5002,5003,5004,5005,5006,5007
5005	The Spectre and Meltdown speculative execution security  vulnerabilities fall into the category of “low probability, but very  high impact” potential exploits. The holes that Spectre and Meltdown  open up into systems might enable any application to read the data of  any other app, when running on the same server in the same pool of  system memory – bypassing any and all security permissions. These  potential exploits apply to every IT shop, from single-tenant servers  potentially exposed to malware to apps running in a virtual machine (VM)  framework in an enterprise datacenter to apps running in a multi-tenant  public cloud instance. There are no known exploits for Spectre and Meltdown – yet.  Therefore, there are no patterns for antivirus and malware detection  suites to match. After the first exploit gets loose in the wild, it is  likely to have an open opportunity to siphon data from any infected  system. Variants will quickly proliferate. Keeping up with proliferating  exploit variants will quickly devolve into a losing game of “Whac-A-Mole.” The best strategy is to fix Spectre and Meltdown before the first  real exploits are demonstrated. However, there is a dramatic difference  between applying a normal software update to patch a security exploit;  applying the new Spectre and Meltdown fixes boils down to managing  extreme complexity. Every IT organization will be challenged to address  this extreme complexity over the next few calendar quarters. Plus, we  only talk here about computing; modern datacenter switch architectures  also use server processors and are likewise also at risk. Ditto for  storage arrays and clustered storage that rely on servers are their  basic building blocks. We think that Spectre and Meltdown do have the potential to: Accelerate enterprise IT migration to cloud-based platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications.Increase cloud and enterprise consideration of non-Intel based servers. The following is what IT is up against and how IT might better cope with these updates. How To Fix Spectre and Meltdown (Condensed Version) Spectre and Meltdown fixes start with potential microcode updates  from server processor manufacturers AMD, Cavium, IBM, Intel, Oracle and  Qualcomm. The impact then ripples to firmware updates coordinated  between processor manufacturers and contract motherboard manufacturers  and original design manufacturers (ODMsuch as ASUS, Gigabyte, Quanta and  Wiwynn) and OEM system vendors (such as Dell EMC, HPE, Huawei, IBM,  Lenovo, Supermicro and Oracle). On top of all of that are matching  security patches for OS distributions (Canonical, CoreOS, Red Hat and  SUSE Linux distributions, plus Microsoft Windows Server, to start),  hypervisors (Hyper-V, KVM, VMware ESXi, Xen and others) and container  frameworks (Docker, Red Hat OpenShift and others). The entire stack of Spectre and Meltdown fixes is still very fresh and not fully tested. It is going to take time for this complex system to reach stability. We collectively call the Spectre and Meltdown fixes “CVEs” in this  article, short for the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures numbers they  have each been issued: Spectre Variant 1: Bounds Check Bypass (CVE-2017-5753)Variant 2: Branch Target Injection (CVE-2017-5715) Meltdown Variant 3: Rogue Data Cache Load (CVE-2017-5754)  Processor Fixes All current generation server processors – AMD Epyc, Cavium  ThunderX2, IBM Power9, Intel Xeon SP, and Qualcomm Centriq 2400 – are  affected by one or more of these CVEs to one degree or another, as are  many older AMD, IBM, Intel, and Oracle processors models. All are  scrambling to ship microcode and firmware patches to their downstream  supply chain, although Cavium and Qualcomm carry less of a burden since  their affected processors are just entering the market. For most enterprise datacenters, the primary concern here is  deploying updates to older AMD and Intel processors and to older OS and  hypervisor distributions and releases. However, for the platform and  system software supply chain, the number of processor models that will  need to be regression tested is extraordinary. I’m not going to describe CVE exploit details (see here for a great explanation from Chris Williams at our sister publication The Register)  or which processor vendors are most or least affected. All the fixes  involve some amount of performance degradation, from trivial to  double-digit percentages. While early fixes have been issued (or are not  necessary) for variants one and three, variant two is harder to fix and  affected processor vendors will be updating all their patches through  the first quarter. We list most of the processors in use today in the  table below with a summary of their CVE exploit exposure and update  status. Note that these CVEs potentially expose data on compute accelerators  designed to map accelerator-local physical memory into a processor’s OS  kernel address space. This type of shared memory space is sometimes  called “heterogeneous computing.” The impact here is for servers  accelerating data analytics and deep learning with any shared memory  add-in accelerator. The shared memory risk is two-fold, because  processors can access accelerator memory and accelerators can access  system memory. Because of that, an accelerator that includes a  processor architecture using speculative and/or out-of-order execution  might also require fixes to address the CVEs, adding to a IT  organization’s update complexity. Of the server compute accelerators  listed below, only Xeon Phi is known to perform speculative execution  and therefore only its processor architecture is potentially exposed to  both risks. GPU accelerators do not implement speculative execution,  they are only affected by speculative processor access to  accelerator-local memory. We exclude FPGA-based accelerators, but if  they implement shared memory architecture, they might also be affected.  We also exclude processors with integrated graphics, as integrated  graphics are not used as compute accelerators. Server processor vendors will eventually fix their silicon designs so  that these CVE patches are not needed. However, there is a two-year a  minimum timeline for implementing these fixes in silicon. That means  first half of 2020, at the earliest, before any of the current server  processor vendors can ship fixed chips in volume.	zblizone	5001,5002,5003,5004,5005,5006,5007
5006	It can be difficult to find a quality Linux distribution that meets  your needs. This is partly because there are just too many operating  systems from which to choose. My suggestion is to first find a desktop  environment that you prefer, and then narrow down your distro search to  one that focuses on that DE. For instance, if you like KDE, both Kubuntu  and Netrunner are solid choices. With all of that said, there is another KDE-focused Linux distro that  I highly recommend. Called "KaOS," it is rolling release, meaning you  can alway be confident that your computer is running modern packages.  Today, KaOS gets its first updated ISO for 2018, and you should  definitely use it to upgrade your install media. Why? Because version  2018.01 has fixes for Spectre and Meltdown thanks to Linux kernel 4.14.14 with both AMD and Intel ucode.                                                                                                                       "This ISO uses the CRC and finobt enabled XFS filesystem as default.  CRCs enable enhanced error detection due to hardware issues, whilst the  format changes also improves crash recovery algorithms and the ability  of various tools to validate and repair metadata corruptions when they  are found. The free inode btree does not index used inodes, allowing  faster, more consistent inode allocation performance as filesystems  age," says The KaOS Team. ALSO READ: Wine 3.0 is here to run Windows software on your Linux box The team also shares, "As always with this rolling distribution, you  will find the very latest packages for the Plasma Desktop, this includes  Frameworks 5.42.0, Plasma 5.11.5, KDE Applications 17.12.1...Besides  running Plasma on KaOS, a new option is added, Liquidshell. This is a  lightweight environment currently in development, but already added so  its progress can be followed."                                                             Liquidshell The KaOS Team shares some of the most significant updated packages below.

Who should  download ISO 2018.01? Those that are planning to do fresh installs and  want to have updated media on hand. Of course, those that are new to  KaOS would download it too. If you want to download the new ISO, you can grab it here. Please note that there is one major known bug -- it cannot be installed to storage set up with RAID.	zblizone	5001,5002,5003,5004,5005,5006,5007
5007	Cisco  Systems has expanded its investigation into products that may be  impacted by the Spectre and Meltdown exploits, adding nine more products  to the list that already includes dozens of systems. In an update to a security advisory, the San Jose, Calif., networking  giant said it is investigating several network application, service and  acceleration products, as well as network management, routing and  server products that weren't covered in an initial advisory earlier this  month. Network application, service and acceleration products included in  the updated advisory are Cisco's vBond Orchestrator, vEdge 5000, vEdge  Cloud, vManage NMS and vSmart Controller. Also included in the updated  advisory are the Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller and  Virtual Application Policy Controller, as well as c800 Series Integrated  Services Routers and the C880 M4 Server. [RELATED: The Latest On Spectre And Meltdown] Cisco's investigation into the Spectre and Meltdown exploits began  with dozens of products including its Cisco Cloud Services Platform  2100, ASR, NCS, XRv9000 and Industrial Integrated Service Routers; Nexus  series switches including blade and fabric models; as well as UCS B-  and C-Series blade and rack servers. Fixes are pending, according to the advisory, for three B-Series  servers and one C-Series UCS server, as well as the C460 M4 rack server. The company said that because the majority of its products are  proprietary closed systems, they are not vulnerable to the Spectre and  Meltdown exploits, which affect chips from multiple vendors, including  Intel and AMD. Still, the company said a Cisco product deployed as a virtual machine  or container, "even while not being directly affected by any of these  vulnerabilities, could be targeted by such attacks if the hosting  environment is vulnerable. The company said customers should "harden  their virtual environment" and "ensure that all security updates are  installed," adding that it would release software updates to combat the  potential threats. "This continues to be an ongoing investigation, so we are advising  customers to please be aware that products and services currently  considered not under investigation or vulnerable may subsequently be  added to the advisory as additional information becomes available," a  Cisco spokesman said in a statement. "Cisco puts the security of our customers first," the statement read.  "When we have a vulnerability in our products, we issue a security  advisory to make sure our customers know what it is and how to address  it. Cisco immediately launched an investigation into the recently  published security research that details an industry-wide issue  affecting speculative execution in modern CPU architectures. Cisco PSIRT  [Product Security Incident Response Team] has issued a security  advisory to help customers understand which Cisco products may be  affected and assess the potential implications for their networks. Fixes  will be published for affected products as they become available, and  potential workarounds will be documented where available. " Richard Bayes, senior director of global operations and engineering  at Liberty Technology, a Griffin, Ga.-based solution provider that works  with Cisco, called the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities "a big  catastrophe" with the potential to hurt customer relationships if  patches significantly impact performance.	zblizone	5001,5002,5003,5004,5005,5006,5007
6001	The president appears healthy.Russian leader Vladimir Putin dipped into frigid waters early Friday at a lake in northwestern Russia to mark the Orthodox observance of the Epiphany, which commemorates the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River.The president arrived for the pre-dawn ceremony flanked by journalists with video cameras and monks holding gold icons depicting Jesus and his mother Mary, then strode to a wooden platform cut into frozen Lake Seliger. He lowered himself into the water, made a sign of the cross and submerged himself for a moment, in a scene captured by state media. His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the temperature was about 21 degrees Fahrenheit.Orthodox Christians in Russia observe the feast of the Epiphany on Jan. 19, rather than Jan. 6, as in the West, because they follow the Julian calendar, which observes Christmas on Jan. 7.The ceremony to purify the spirit drew half a million worshipers to natural and artificial pools at 4,000 sites across Russia on Friday, the government-run Channel One reported. Some of those people took a dip in the sea at Sochi and others plunged into water amid -58 degree weather in remote Yakutia. That region holds the title of the world's coldest permanently occupied village, where even eyelashes freeze.The devotional moment represented another bare-chested media day for Putin, a leader who oversees a corrupt political system, imprisonment and torture of gays, ongoing harassment of and violence against journalists and apparent involvement in U.S. election meddling, but also a public relations operation to sustain the mythos of his machismo.Putin has garnered wide attention for photos and video footage of him shirtless on horseback, shirtless fishing, shirtless hunting and now, shirtless worshiping.This is not the first time Putin has taken part in the Epiphany ceremony, although it is the first publicly viewed occurrence, Peskov said. That may represent an effort to appeal to religious voters ahead of the March presidential election, which comes as public support of government policies dips to its lowest in a decade.Putin has made an effort in recent years to connect religion and Communism, Newsweek reported, two concepts at odds since the anti-religious Russian Revolution a century ago.The U.S. ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman, will take part in an Epiphany ceremony over the weekend near Moscow, embassy spokeswoman Maria Olson said.	zblizone	6001,6002,6003,6004,6005,6006,6007,6008,6009
6002	The horrors of the nearly 900-day Nazi siege of Leningrad during World War II left a mutation on the genetic code of the survivors that was passed on to their progeny, including a preternatural sense of civic responsibility. Russian President Vladmir Putin, born in what is now called St. Petersburg, has got the golden gene. It sounds like the stuff of a bad pulp sci-fi thriller. But in Russia, the theory is getting silver-screen treatment. Officials from the Russian Culture Ministry and State Duma as well as World War II veterans got a chance to watch a special closed screening of Blockade Blood, Genetics, directed by Eleonora Lukyanova, on January 18.The siege by German and Finnish forces during World War II lasted for 872 days -- one of the longest and deadliest in history. Estimates of casualties vary, but some sources state that 1 million residents of Leningrad died from hunger, disease, exposure, and shelling.According to the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, the film poses the question why a large segment of the city's population is united into "one psychological-behavioral group" without any visible ancestral link?Obviously some genetic mutation, the film argues, which all those born of siege survivors share. And how does this gene manifest itself? According to Blockade Blood, Genetics, it gives the holders a "high responsibility for what is happening in the country and the city," Novaya Gazeta said. The film then lists some of St. Petersburg's native sons, with a few daughters thrown in, who are among the fortunate few. Putin, who was born in 1952, nine years after the siege was lifted, is one of those. Others Leningrad natives whom the film asserts also have the gene include the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, and Sergei Mironov.Who's Sergei Mironov? Only the head of the Just Russia party, which backed production of the 48-minute film."I’m proud that I and the party took such an active role in the creation of the film," Mironov was quoted by Novaya Gazeta as saying. Putin himself has spoken openly and written about the privations of his parents and relatives, many of whom died during the siege, including two older brothers.The film highlights the work of Oleg Glotov, from the Ott Research Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology in St. Petersburg.Glotov has argued in the past that, by studying survivors of the siege, he and his colleagues identified three gene variations associated with a more efficient metabolism in people who are starving.Commenting on Glotov’s work, geneticist Stephen O'Brien told Science magazine that the findings were "fascinating," but warned that the small pool of survivors made the results "very difficult to interpret."With much of Russia’s media kept on a tight leash by the Kremlin, Putin is frequently depicted in films, videos, books, and articles as being strong, heroic, and adventurous, among other things.	zblizone	6001,6002,6003,6004,6005,6006,6007,6008,6009
6003	In the desert of eastern Syria, not far from a town called Deir ez-Zor, there’s reportedly a pile of stones surrounding a wooden board, with an Orthodox cross and an inscription burned into the wood: “2017. To the eternal memory of the warriors killed and missing in the SAR [Syrian Arab Republic].” The stone cairn is decorated with a machine gun belt, a large-caliber bullet and a Russian army helmet. The dead are identified only by their wartime nicknames: Warrior, Executioner, Scorpion, Nightingale.All were purportedly Russian mercenaries who perished in the war in Syria. But their real names don’t appear on any death toll. Russia will never acknowledge their apparent role in the conflict. For Moscow’s secret soldiers, that pile of stones may be as close as they will ever get to official recognition.Keep Up With This Story And More By Subscribing NowThe use of mercenaries is illegal under Russian law. But since at least the 1990s, Moscow has used them as deniable proxies for its military interventions abroad. In Bosnia and in the breakaway Moldovan province of Transnistria, teams of “volunteers” secretly backed by the Russian military went into battle—while Moscow’s real troops officially acted as neutral peacekeepers. Over the past four years, however, President Vladimir Putin has dramatically ramped up the use of private military contractors as a crucial part of his foreign policy, using them to extend Russian power in eastern Ukraine and Syria.The shift began at dawn on March 18, 2014, when units of regular Russian servicemen, their insignia removed from their uniforms, moved out from a base at Sevastopol to occupy key military targets across the Ukrainian province of Crimea. Backing these soldiers was a motley group of unidentified fighters who swooped into radio stations and local government buildings. Some were pro-Moscow Ukrainian policemen, others were local gangsters—but many, according to Western analysts and the Security Service of Ukraine, were paid mercenaries.Later that summer, as war flared in eastern Ukraine, Russia’s military intelligence agency, known as the GRU, began sending much larger and better-organized units of ex-Russian servicemen, recruited mostly from the North Caucasus, to fight in the Donbass. Since then, mercenaries have become “a central element of the Kremlin’s geopolitical adventures, whether in Ukraine or, even more clearly, Syria,” says Mark Galeotti, a senior researcher at the Institute of International Relations, a Prague-based think tank.Outsourcing fighting to mercenaries has allowed the Kremlin to covertly participate in conflicts like the war in Ukraine, where it officially claims it is not involved. It’s also enabled Russia to boost its military presence in declared wars, such as the one in Syria, without having to announce casualties, making it easier to maintain public support.Mercenaries are “an illegal way to provide cannon fodder for the Kremlin's foreign adventures,” says Kirill Mikhailov, an activist at the Moscow-based Conflict Intelligence Team, a group that gathers open-source intelligence on Russia’s covert military activities. “But even though they are mercenaries, they are still Russians, and we believe the Russian public has the right to know about Russians dying while doing Putin's dirty work abroad.”The exact nature of the relationship between the Russian military and the secretive private military companies operating in Syria and Ukraine is unclear. But the Kremlin has not been shy about publicly honoring leading mercenary company officials for their services to the motherland. In December 2016, Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Utkin was photographed at a Kremlin banquet with Putin. Utkin is the founder of the Wagner Group, which the U.S. Treasury Department named as a major recruiter of Russian citizens to fight in Syria when the department imposed personal sanctions on him last year. (Wagner could not be reached for comment.)The Russian president has also been photographed with Yevgeny Prigozhin, a St. Petersburg entrepreneur dubbed "Putin's chef" by Russian media because of his extensive restaurant and catering businesses. The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed banking and travel sanctions on Prigozhin for his stake in Moscow-based Evro Polis, an oil and general trading company. Russian anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny has revealed deep commercial ties between Evro Polis and the Russian Defense Ministry—and the independent fontanka.ru news site has called Prigozhin a front for Wagner Group’s activities in Syria. (On its website, the company lists interests in mining, oil and gas production, and in 2016 it opened an office in the Syrian capital of Damascus.) Neither Evro Polis nor Prigozhin's Concorde Management responded to Newsweek’s requests for comment.Over the past few years, Utkin has emerged as perhaps the most well-known figure in the shadowy world of private Russian military contractors. Like former Navy SEAL Erik Prince, the founder of the Blackwater, the U.S. military contractor that provided tens of thousands of private security guards during the second Iraq War, Utkin has become a key player in his country’s military deployments. But unlike Blackwater, Utkin’s soldiers have no official contract or relationship with the Russian Defense Ministry—and unlike U.S. private contractors, Wagner’s men are fighting on the front line.“U.S. contractors do auxiliary work, such as guarding oil fields,” says Pavel Felgenhauer, a military analyst at the independent Moscow-based Novaya Gazeta newspaper. Companies like Wagner are more like African armies for hire, says Felgenhauer, such as the infamous Executive Outcomes, which the Angolan and Sierra Leone governments hired in the 1990s to brutally suppress Marxist insurgencies.Born in Ukraine in 1970, Utkin commanded a spetsnaz brigade, the special forces unit of Russia’s military intelligence directorate. He retired in 2013 to work for a private military company called the Moran Security Group that specialized, according to its website, in anti-piracy operations, along with security and training missions around the world. According to a 2016 investigation by Radio Free Europe, senior Moran Security Group managers in 2013 set up a St. Petersburg–based organization known as the Slavonic Corps, which recruited former Russian soldiers to protect oil fields and pipelines in Syria. Utkin was one of their commanders. The mission was reportedly a disaster, and according to a senior London-based U.S. private security source who is not authorized to speak on the record, the Slavonic Corps was badly equipped, poorly led and suffered heavy casualties.“It’s often hard to tell with military contractors where private interests end and government ones begin,” says the private security source who is not authorized to speak on the record. “That’s kind of the point. With the Slavonic Corps in Syria, it was probably both. Russian oil companies wanted to get into [Syria], and the [Kremlin] also wanted to have a presence in there that would be nonofficial.”Despite the failure, Utkin founded the Wagner Group in 2014, naming it after his nom de guerre, which was reportedly inspired by a fascination with Nazi Germany. Quickly, he became a key, if unofficial, employee of the Kremlin, according to Felgenhauer, the military analyst. Utkin showed up in the rebel Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, leading a group of former soldiers who fought with local rebels. Wagner’s people are “direct proxies of Russia,” says Felgenhauer. “But they are semi-independent and give plausible deniability—the Russians can say, ‘We don’t know anything about this.’”	zblizone	6001,6002,6003,6004,6005,6006,6007,6008,6009
6004	Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned the U.S. not to try to influence the outcome of elections in Russia, where he will fight to secure a fourth term in office. Putin, accused of meddling in the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald Trump—as well as in other polls, such as Britain's Brexit referendum—made his comments after journalists questioned why Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny would not be on the ballot later this year.“Nobody likes it when you meddle in their internal political and domestic affairs,” he told journalists. “Our American friends dislike this in particular.”Putin is an odds-on favorite to win the March election, albeit with lower turnout than the Kremlin would like in the face of the increasing voter apathy plaguing recent elections. In addition to a history of vote-rigging in some regions, elections in Russia are frequently uneven battles between the incumbent and a carefully vetted cast of opposition candidates.Navalny, one of Putin's most vocal critics, will not be on the ballot this March due to a fraud conviction, which he and his supporters claimed was orchestrated in order to disqualify him from running. Asked during a meeting of pro-government journalists about outrage abroad over Navalny, Putin suggested it betrayed a preference for his rival in Washington.The Kremlin has repeatedly denied that Russia influenced the 2016 presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies suspect that Russian hackers were behind leaks from the Democratic National Convention, while the most popular social media sites revealed Russia's use of fake accounts, online campaigns and advertisements to influence debate. “We see their reaction even to the unreliable information about meddling,” Putin said, referring to the ongoing investigation.Turning his attention to Navalny, Putin echoed the response from his Ministry of Foreign Affairs last month, which branded U.S. criticism for the blocking of Navalny and other rivals as “direct interference” in the coming election.“This obviously speaks to the preferences of the American administration and the leadership of other countries,” Putin said. “It tells who they would like to promote in Russia’s political sphere and who they would like to see… if not at the helm, than in government."In that sense, they blew it,” Putin said. “It would have been better to keep quiet.”But in fact, the U.S. government took no official stance on Navalny after he was blocked from running for election, and it was Russian state-run media that first asked for the State Department’s response. Neither those nor the subsequent comments obtained by Newsweek mentioned the Kremlin critic by name, instead criticizing the “ongoing crackdown against independent voices, from journalists to civil society activists and opposition politicians.”	zblizone	6001,6002,6003,6004,6005,6006,6007,6008,6009
6005	But this creative hub offers space, workshops and guidance to a specific group: pro-Kremlin Russian youths.President Vladimir Putin is central to the group's ideology, and his presence is hard to miss.Young artists and designers use the modern loft space to work under Putin's watchful eye: The Russian leader stares from a painted portrait hanging above the stairs.Putin will be counting on their support when voters head to the ballot box in a presidential election scheduled for March 18. Opinion polls suggest he will win another six-year term.Gleb Krainik, 32, who was a project manager behind the Putin rings, gets one out of the case and holds it up."He is the most powerful politician not only here in Russia, but in the world today," he said when asked about what inspired the jewelry.Putin is "everywhere here," adds Vihlyancev, 33, taking a stroll through the office. “But he is hard not to notice in the life of Russia as well.”The creative types who use the space are not forced to incorporate Putin or patriotic themes into their work, Vihlyancev says, but many do. (Krainik declined to comment on whether Project Network received funding from the Kremlin, citing its "agreement with investors," adding: "This is one of the most common questions we get ... I am not going to answer it now either.")On the far wall, there is a bright yellow painting in the shape of the Crimean Peninsula — a topic Vihlyancev says was popular with the group's artists following Crimea's 2014 annexation by Russia. Western leaders and the Ukrainian government in Kiev described the move as an illegal land grab by Putin.Wearing a paint-splattered tracksuit and with headphones on, Yulia Khaliullina, a 25-year-old artist, stands next to the painting as she completes one of her own.Khaliullina has painted many portraits of the Russian leader — for fun and commercial gain. And she has sold them all.“There is definitely a demand for it,” Khaliullina adds. “It’s trendy.”Khaliullina admits she doesn’t take much interest in politics, but says she is happy with the way things are in Russia and doesn’t want them to change.“I feel like I can have many opportunities here," she said. "And it didn’t just happen — these conditions were created for us. I am a happy person and I think the government, and specifically Putin, played a role in it.”Asked what she makes of criticism leveled against Putin, she responded: “I wouldn't draw him if I had even a hint of negativity toward him. I don’t paint people I don’t like, even for money.”Taking a break from shopping at Moscow’s GUM department store just steps away from Red Square, Anastasia Stepanova and Anna Astasieva say they are likely to back Putin at the ballot box.“There is only one option really,” Stepanova says, laughing. "The one everyone knows”Both bubbly 20-year-olds are studying to be doctors and acknowledge that while many problems face modern-day Russia — from low salaries to the widening gap in the standard of living between Moscow and the rest of the country — the narrowness of the field running against Putin leaves them with few options.“I don’t see anyone else who would be better or worthy," Stepanova adds.But while Putin is popular among millennials, Levada Center polling found that only 15 percent of respondents aged 18 to 24 think he is serving the interests of “average people.” A majority believes he is looking out for the security services and oligarchs. And 74 percent in that age group say Putin is responsible — either directly or "to some extent" — for the problems facing Russia while he has been in power. The numbers are similar for Russians aged 25 to 39.Sitting at a trendy coffee shop in central Moscow, Anton, a 30-year-old businessman, doesn’t mince words talking about Putin's 18 years as president and prime minister."The fish rots from its head,” says Anton, who spoke on the condition that only his last name would be used because he feared repercussions.While he thinks Putin is a strong politician, he adds: “All the problems we are experiencing in Russia right now start with our president. He is the one responsible. If he is a god in this country, he is not doing that well.”Anton says he is still considering his options for the looming election. He's struggling to find an alternative to the 65-year-old Putin.“I don’t see an individual, or a political faction, which would be able to change anything in this country,” he said. “Maybe he or she will appear later, but right now I am left clueless about who to vote for."	zblizone	6001,6002,6003,6004,6005,6006,6007,6008,6009
6006	Panelists on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” were just as disgusted as anyone by salacious claims by a former porn actress about her sexual relationship with President Donald Trump — but they said it was more than tabloid trash.The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen set up an LLC to pay $130,000 in hush money to Stormy Daniels shortly before the election, possibly in violation of election law — but multiple news outlets passed on the story before the election.“Funny, the National Enquirer is not covering this, probably because Donald Trump is friends with them,” said co-host Mika Brzezinski.Co-host Willie Geist said it was a “serious and real story,” despite the subject, and host Joe Scarborough said it proved claims in the infamous dossier that Trump had been compromised by Russia president Vladimir Putin.“Vladimir Putin has something that he is holding over Donald Trump’s head, and it is bad,” Scarborough said. “We started asking that question in December of 2015, two years ago, when Donald Trump was defending Vladimir Putin for assassinating journalists. Donald Trump was defending Vladimir Putin for assassinating political leaders in his own country. Donald Trump was defending Vladimir Putin for all the things he did.”Republican strategist Susan Del Percio said conservative Christians had already compromised their own values to back Trump, after the scandals that had erupted before the election.“How do you get past the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape?” Del Percio said. “It’s equally as bad, it’s his voice, saying what he did. This man is a scoundrel. His values are twisted.”Scarborough said multiple Trump campaign associates and Cabinet members had lied about their contacts with Russians, and he said the president was hoping the barrage of scandal would eventually take its toll on Americans.“So what is Donald Trump hoping? He is not hoping he can just brush aside a story of a porn star,” Scarborough said. “He’s hoping that when the truth comes out about what Vladimir Putin has and has had hanging over his head for decades, possibly, that we will all be too numb to notice. Ten tweets a day, five lies a day, bread and circuses, all of the game show, reality show distractions. Mika, that’s all he’s hoping. He wants to numb the American people, he wants to numb the electorate, he wants to numb everybody — his supporters, which already is numbing a lot of his supporters — to the dirty reality that is — not only his presidency, but his past.”MSNBC contributor Donnie Deutsch said the scandal had barely been a blip, although it would have commanded wall-to-wall coverage if any other president had been accused of paying off a porn actress to cover up an extramarital affair.“This would bring down any other president, it would be over,” Deutsch said. “Because this president has set the bar so below mud, that it almost becomes just another day at the office. We can’t let that happen. Let’s think about this again, think about that story. I don’t understand just from a selling newspapers point of view, just from a pure capitalism point of view.”	zblizone	6001,6002,6003,6004,6005,6006,6007,6008,6009
6007	Russian president Vladimir Putin believes that legislation laying out rules for the country’s cryptocurrency sector will be needed in the future.According to a report from Russian-language news agency TASS, Putin said on Jan. 11 that legislation “will be definitely required in [the] future]” on this front."This is the prerogative of the central bank at present and the central bank has sufficient authority so far. However, in broad terms, legislative regulation will be definitely required in future,” he said.The news source quoted the Russian leader voicing both the risks and opportunities involved with cryptocurrencies.“It is known that the cryptocurrency is not backed by anything. It cannot be a store of value. No material valuables are behind it and it is not secured by anything,” Putin reportedly said. “It can be a settlement medium to a certain degree and in certain situations. This is done quickly and efficiently.”That seeming degree of support – coming from someone who months prior briefly met with Vitalik Buterin, the creator of ethereum – was at odds with quoted comments by Russian prime minister Dimitry Medvedev.Also reported by TASS, Medvedev said that such an eventuality could occur, especially if blockchain becomes more widely used."Cryptocurrencies can also disappear in an exactly the same way in several years and the technology being the basis for their development - blockchain - will become part of everyday reality," the prime minister reportedly said.Russia’s long-awaited cryptocurrency legislation is said to be coming next month. In its report on Putin’s remarks, TASS quoted senior lawmaker Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev, who offered the new timeline to reporters last week.	zblizone	6001,6002,6003,6004,6005,6006,6007,6008,6009
6008	US president Donald Trump came to office promising an isolationist foreign policy, which put “America First,” above the rest of the global order. He has actively rejected taking global leadership.The world has responded by rejecting him, according to a poll released today (Jan. 18). Gallup asked about 1,000 people in 134 countries whether they approved of American, German, Chinese, and Russian leadership. They found that the number of people who approved of US leadership had dropped 18 points compared to Barack Obama’s last year in office. When you factor in the 43% who disapprove of America’s leadership, Trump now has a global net approval rating lower than Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping.There are a few positives for Trump, though. While Obama had a strained relationship with Israel, Trump has embraced the country and has subsequently received a 14% bump in support there over his predecessor. And those figures came before Trump recognized Jerusalem as the country’s capital, as the poll was taken between March and November 2017. Russian support for the US has grown 6% under Trump, though that’s not saying much, since only 8% of Russians approve of American leadership.Despite Trump paying almost no attention to Africa, America’s backing in the continent has stayed strong, with 51% supporting American leadership, compared to 20% disapproving. However, US approval still saw a 10% drop in 11 countries on the continent and it’s likely to get worse in next year’s numbers, following reports last week that Trump referred to African nations as “shithole countries.” China, the continent’s largest trade partner, had a 50% approval rating in Africa, with 15% disapproving—that gave it a higher net approval than the US.Meanwhile, the number of people who approve of the US in the Americas has plummeted from 49% in 2016, to 24% in 2017. Some 58% of people now disapprove of US leadership there.The US also saw a stark drop in Europe, where Trump has lambasted NATO and said Britain would be “better off” without the European Union. Only 25% of Europeans approve of the US, compared to 44% in 2016. The disapproval rate is now at 56%	zblizone	6001,6002,6003,6004,6005,6006,6007,6008,6009
6009	Joe Scarborough of MSNBC claimed Friday that President Donald Trump was attempting to create perpetual scandal in order to desensitize the public so that it becomes indifferent to whatever Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly has on him.Scarborough said the current scandal regarding Trump's supposed relations with porn star Stormy Daniels is "small compared [to] the biggest truth that Donald Trump doesn't want out... Vladimir Putin has something he is holding over Donald Trump's head. And it is bad."The Morning Joe host suggested that the numerous scandals surrounding the president have all been part of a conscious strategy to divert attention from the Russia investigation and an infamous dossier that found Trump to be vulnerable to blackmail by the Kremlin."Think about it. If you're Donald Trump and...you're attacking allies all over the world. You're attacking the media. You're employing the same that Stalin used: calling the media 'enemies of the people,' Scarborough continued. "You're making outrageous racist comments... in the White House... You send out a flurry of outrageous tweets every day. Well, there is a method to that madness. It is what dictators use. I'm not calling Donald Trump a dictator, but it is what autocrats and dictators have done for a long time."Scarborough said Trump's tactics were reminiscent of those employed by Adolf Hitler but maintained he wasn't attempting to make a direct comparison between the president and the Nazi leader. Trump is flooding the public "in so many lies," Scarborough contended, and is "numbing the masses" in the process.So, what is Donald Trump hoping? He is not hoping he can just brush aside a story of a porn star. He’s hoping when the truth comes out about what Vladimir Putin has and has had hanging over his head for decades, possibly, that we will all be too numb to notice, said Scarborough. Since Trump became president, he has made over 2,000 false or misleading claims, according to an analysis of his statements from The Washington Post. But his behavior has not come without consequences. Trump ended his first year with the lowest approval rating of any modern president (39 percent), according to a NBC News–Wall Street Journal poll.Trump has vehemently denied that his campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 presidential election. An investigation remains ongoing.	zblizone	6001,6002,6003,6004,6005,6006,6007,6008,6009
